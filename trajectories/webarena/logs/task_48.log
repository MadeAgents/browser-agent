✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “My Account” page; the “Recent Orders” table is visible. No computation of the requested metrics has been performed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward the goal. The “Recent Orders” section shows order dates, statuses, and totals, but appears limited to a subset of orders.
- table “Recent Orders” (marker [1534]) — visible; includes columns for “Date”, “Order Total”, and “Status”.
- link “View All” (marker [1530]) — visible and enabled; likely leads to the complete order history needed to check the last three days (6/10/2023–6/12/2023).
- Per-row links with visible text “View Order” in the Action column — visible and enabled; allow viewing individual order details (including status and total).
Based on what’s visible, none of the listed orders show dates within the past three days, but full history must be accessed to confirm counts and totals.

The user wants the number of fulfilled orders and the total spent over the past three days from 6/12/2023 (i.e., 6/10–6/12/2023). To get accurate data, I should access the full order history. On the current "My Account" page, I see a left-side navigation list with a "My Orders" link (bid 1614), which is the correct place to find all orders and possibly filter by date. The “Recent Orders” table doesn’t include June dates, so it’s insufficient. The next best step is to click “My Orders” to view the complete order list, where I can check statuses (looking for fulfilled, likely “Complete”) and totals for orders dated 6/10–6/12/2023.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “My Orders” page. The full orders table is visible with dates, totals, statuses, and per-row actions. No computation of the requested 6/10/23–6/12/23 metrics has been finalized yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to the goal. The “Orders” table (axtree node [1474]) is visible and readable.
- Columns present: “Order #” [1478], “Date” [1479], “Order Total” [1480], “Status” [1481], “Action” [1482].
- Visible rows show dates of 5/17/23 [1486], 5/2/23 [1497, 1508], and earlier (e.g., March/February in the screenshot). None of the currently visible rows are within 6/10/23–6/12/23.
- Status values include “Canceled” [1489], “Pending” [1500, 1511], and some “Complete” entries on older (pre-June) orders visible in the screenshot.
- Per-row action links “View Order” are present and enabled (e.g., [1491], [1502], [1513]) for drilling into details.
Based on the currently displayed (likely most recent) rows, there are no orders dated within the past three days (6/10/23–6/12/23). If the table is already sorted by most recent date, the count and spend for that window would be zero; otherwise, sorting by the “Date” column [1479] and/or reviewing additional pages would confirm.

The user wants the number of fulfilled (i.e., “Complete”) orders and the total amount spent over the last three days relative to 6/12/2023 (so 6/10/2023–6/12/2023). I’m already on the My Orders page with the orders table visible. The table shows the most recent orders first (dates listed: 5/17/23, 5/2/23, etc.), and there are no entries from June 2023 at all. Since page 1 is the most recent and the latest visible order date is 5/17/23, there are no orders within 6/10–6/12/2023. Therefore, the number of fulfilled orders in that window is 0, and the total amount spent is 0. I will communicate this clearly, including brief reasoning, and present the amount as just the decimal per the formatting guideline.

✅ Current Progress: 
- Navigated to the “My Orders” page and reviewed the Orders table.
- Preliminary conclusion sent to user: 0 fulfilled orders and $0 spent for 6/10/2023–6/12/2023, based on currently visible rows.

🔍 Current State Analysis: 
- This page is directly relevant to the goal.
- Visible Orders table [1474] shows columns: “Order #” [1478], “Date” [1479], “Order Total” [1480], “Status” [1481], “Action” [1482].
- Top visible rows include dates 5/17/23 [1486] and 5/2/23 [1497, 1508]; statuses include “Canceled” [1489] and “Pending” [1500, 1511]. Some older rows show “Complete” (fulfilled) but all are before June 2023.
- The page indicates multiple orders exist (e.g., “items 1 to 10 of 37 total” in view), implying pagination; therefore, concluding “0 orders” without confirming sort order may be premature.
- Relevant interactive elements to progress:
  - Columnheader “Date” [1479] (likely sortable) to ensure most recent orders are shown first.
  - Per-row “View Order” links (e.g., [1491], [1502], [1513]) to verify specific order dates/statuses if needed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the columnheader “Date” [1479] to sort by most recent. Verify whether any orders fall within 6/10/2023–6/12/2023 and have Status “Complete” [1481].
- If the first row after sorting still shows 5/17/23 or earlier, confirm the final result as: fulfilled orders = 0, total spent = $0.
