The user wants the count of comments with more downvotes than upvotes for the user who made the latest post on the "photoshopbattles" forum. 
Plan:
1) Navigate to the Forums page to find the "photoshopbattles" forum. The tips say to use the Forum tab and the "alphabetical" option to find a forum easily.
2) Open the "photoshopbattles" forum.
3) Sort by "New" to identify the latest post and note its author.
4) Visit that author's profile.
5) Go to their comments list and identify comments where downvotes > upvotes, count them, and report the number.

Currently on the home page, I see a top navigation link "Forums" (bid 42). The next logical step is to click it to go to the Forums page.

The goal is to report the count of comments with more downvotes than upvotes for the user who made the latest post in the photoshopbattles forum. I navigated to the forum, sorted by "New," and identified the latest post’s author as Proud_Idiot. I then opened their profile and clicked the "Comments" tab. The page explicitly states “There are no entries to display,” meaning the user has no comments listed. Therefore, the count of comments with more downvotes than upvotes is 0. I will now provide the count to the user.
