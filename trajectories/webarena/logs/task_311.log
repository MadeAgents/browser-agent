The user wants to know the top contributor (by number of commits) to the "Pytorch GAN" project in this GitLab instance. The current page is the Projects dashboard listing various repositories, but I don't see "Pytorch GAN" in the visible list. According to the tips, the global search bar is not working; instead, I should use the direct search URL pattern: http://10.177.37.113:8023/search?search=<repository-name>&nav_source=navbar. Therefore, the best next step is to navigate to the search results for "Pytorch GAN". Once on the search results page, I will click the project, then navigate to the Contributors tab (under Repository) to identify the contributor with the most commits. For now, I will initiate the search using the goto action with URL-encoded space.

✅ Current Progress: Reached GitLab search results and located the target project “Erik Linder-Norén / PyTorch-GAN”.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward the goal because it lists the PyTorch-GAN project that needs commit-contributor stats. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link to the project: link “Erik Linder-Norén / PyTorch-GAN” (node [318]) — visible and clickable.
- Search box: “Search for projects, issues, etc.” (node [227]) with value “Pytorch GAN” — filled and editable.
- Navigation filters: “Projects 1” (node [285]), “Issues 8” (node [289]), “Merge requests 2” (node [293]) — visible links.
Next required step to progress: open the project via link [318], then navigate to repository statistics/contributors to identify the top committer.

- Top stats link “193 Commits” (node [594]) — visible/clickable; opens the commits list (individual commits, not an author aggregate).
