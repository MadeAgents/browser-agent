The user wants all open issues that ask about OPT model-related questions. I’m already on the Issues page for the metaseq project with the “Open 95” tab selected. To efficiently find relevant issues without scrolling through all 95, I should use the page’s search/filter textbox labeled “Search or filter results...” (bid 551). The best approach is to filter for issues labeled as questions and containing OPT-related terms. GitLab’s issue search supports token-like queries in this field, so entering “label:question OPT” should narrow the list to open issues that are questions and mention OPT/OPT-IML. After filling, I will later submit the search. The immediate next step is to fill the search field with this query.

To ensure an accurate filtered list (open issues with the label “question” and the term “OPT”), I can directly use GitLab’s query parameters in the URL: label_name[]=question to filter by the “question” label and search=OPT to require “OPT” in title/description, while keeping state=opened and the current sorting. This will reliably narrow the list without scrolling and avoid the possibly non-functional token input. After landing on the filtered results, I can extract the issue titles and numbers.

The search box currently shows “label:question OPT,” but the list includes non-question issues (enhancement, bug), so the filter likely hasn’t been applied correctly via the UI. To ensure an accurate filtered list (open issues with the label “question” and the term “OPT”), I can directly use GitLab’s query parameters in the URL: label_name[]=question to filter by the “question” label and search=OPT to require “OPT” in title/description, while keeping state=opened and the current sorting. This will reliably narrow the list without scrolling and avoid the possibly non-functional token input. After landing on the filtered results, I can extract the issue titles and numbers.

✅ Current Progress:
- Reached the metaseq project Issues page with the “Open” tab active.
- Applied filters to target OPT-related questions: “Label = ~question” and keyword “OPT” are visible as active chips.
- A results list of open, OPT-related question issues is displayed (Open 13).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path to the goal; the filtered Open issues list matches “OPT” + question label.
- Relevant elements:
  - Tab “Open 13” [505]: selected (scope limited to open issues).
  - Filter chips area [532]: shows “Label = ~question” and “OPT”; “Clear” button [594] and “Search” button [597] are visible/enabled.
  - Sorting controls: “Updated date” [601] and “Sort direction: Descending” [657] are present.
  - Issues list [661]: visible; each entry has a title link. Example:
    - First item link [665]: “How to load an OPT-IML checkpoint and use it for inference?” (Issue #594). Additional OPT-related question issues follow in this list.
- Next logical action is to extract all issue titles and numbers from list [661] (scroll if needed) to compile the full set of 13 open OPT-related question issues.
