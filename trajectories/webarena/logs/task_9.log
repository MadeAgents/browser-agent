The user needs the full address of all international airports within a 30 km driving distance from "Carnegie Art Museum." On OpenStreetMap, the best approach is:
1) Use the search bar to locate the correct place. The likely correct name is "Carnegie Museum of Art" in Pittsburgh, PA. The search textbox (bid 162) is already focused, and there’s a "Go" button (bid 165).
2) After centering on the museum, I will identify nearby "international airport(s)." In Pittsburgh, the obvious candidate is Pittsburgh International Airport, but I must verify distance by using the Directions tool (bid 167) to calculate driving distance. If there are multiple international airports within 30 km, I must check each.
3) Once I confirm which airports meet the criterion, I need the full address with ZIP code from OSM. For each airport, I should open its details pane and read the full address line.

First step: search for "Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA" to precisely center on the correct location.

Goal: Identify all international airports within a 30 km driving distance from Carnegie Museum of Art and provide their full addresses (with ZIP codes) from OpenStreetMap. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already set with From = Pittsburgh International Airport and To = Carnegie Museum of Art, and mode is Car. To determine if PIT qualifies, I need to see the computed driving distance shown in the directions pane. However, the large "Welcome to OpenStreetMap!" overlay on the left is likely covering the directions details (distance and time). The accessibility tree shows a button 'Close' (bid 217) which corresponds to this overlay. Closing it should reveal the route summary including the distance. Then I can verify if the distance is <=30 km. If yes, I will then open the airport feature to read its full address (street number, street, city, state, ZIP, country) from OSM. If distance >30 km, the answer is that there are no qualifying international airports. First, I will close the welcome overlay to view the route details.

In the Pittsburgh region, other nearby airports (Allegheny County Airport, Beaver County Airport, Rostraver, Butler, etc.) are not “international,” and other airports with “International” in the name (e.g., Arnold Palmer Regional, Erie International) are well beyond 30 km.
