The user needs a checkout discount applicable to all customers. In Magento, checkout discounts are implemented as Cart Price Rules (not Catalog Price Rules). I'm currently on the Dashboard with the Marketing menu expanded and can see the "Cart Price Rules" link (bid 243) in the Promotions section. The next step is to navigate to the Cart Price Rules page to create a new rule. From there, I'll add a new rule with:
- Rule Name: Mother's Day Sale
- Active: Yes (unless instructed otherwise)
- Coupon: No Coupon (so all customers can get it automatically)
- Conditions: leave empty to apply to all
- Actions: Apply "Fixed amount discount for whole cart" with Discount Amount: 15

The goal is to create a cart price rule that applies a $15 discount at checkout for all customers. On the "New Cart Price Rule" page, the required fields are being completed: Rule Name is set, Active is Yes, Websites has “Main Website” selected, and Coupon is “No Coupon” for automatic application. The "Customer Groups" listbox is focused but currently has no selections; to apply the rule to all customers, we need to select all groups (NOT LOGGED IN, General, Wholesale, Retailer). Since the listbox is already focused (from the previous step), the most efficient way to select all items is to use the keyboard shortcut ControlOrMeta+a. I will perform this single action next. After this, I will expand the Actions section to configure “Fixed amount discount for whole cart” with Discount Amount: 15, and then save.

The goal is to configure the cart price rule to apply a $15 discount at checkout for all customers. We’ve already set the Rule Name, Active, Websites, Customer Groups (all selected), and Coupon as “No Coupon,” which ensures the discount applies automatically without a code. The next critical step is to expand the “Actions” section so I can set the “Apply” method to “Fixed amount discount for whole cart” and enter the discount amount of 15. On Magento’s cart price rule form, these settings are inside the “Actions” accordion, currently collapsed. I will click the “Actions” header to expand it.

The user's goal is to draft a cart price rule for a Mother's Day sale that gives a $15 discount at checkout for all customers. We're on the "New Cart Price Rule" page. The Rule Name is already filled, Active is Yes, Websites selected, Customer Groups selected, and Coupon is No Coupon. In the Actions section, the "Apply" combobox (bid 938) is still set to "Percent of product price discount." My previous attempt to click the desired option "Fixed amount discount for whole cart" (option 941) timed out because the element wasn't visible. To avoid repeating the same failed click, I'll use keyboard navigation on the combobox: pressing ArrowDown will move from the current option to the next ("Fixed amount discount"), and a subsequent ArrowDown in the next step will reach "Fixed amount discount for whole cart," followed by Enter to select. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best action is to issue an ArrowDown press on the combobox to start navigating options.

The objective is to draft a new Cart Price Rule that gives a $15 discount at checkout for all customers. We are on the "New Cart Price Rule" page, and the Rule Name is already set to "Mother's Day Sale - $15 Off". Active is Yes, Websites and Customer Groups are selected (all), and Coupon is "No Coupon" which ensures the discount applies automatically for all customers. 

In the Actions section, we need to configure the discount details. The "Apply" field currently displays "Fixed amount discount" (which applies per item), but for a checkout discount, we ultimately need "Fixed amount discount for whole cart". We previously attempted to change the selection but it's not yet confirmed. Regardless, the Discount Amount field is still 0 and must be set to 15. Updating this field moves us closer to completion, and we can then finalize the "Apply" selection to "Fixed amount discount for whole cart" and save.

Therefore, the most productive next single action is to fill the Discount Amount field with 15.

The objective is to draft a new Cart Price Rule that gives a $15 discount at checkout for all customers. We are on the "New Cart Price Rule" page, and the Rule Name is already set to "Mother's Day Sale - $15 Off". Active is Yes, Websites and Customer Groups are selected (all), and Coupon is "No Coupon" which ensures the discount applies automatically for all customers. 

In the Actions section, we need to configure the discount details.

The user wants a cart-wide $15 discount for Mother’s Day that applies to all customers. We’re on the “New Cart Price Rule” page. So far:

- Coupon: “No Coupon” (applies automatically).

The Apply combobox (bid 938) is currently expanded and shows “Fixed amount discount” selected. Clicking the option (941) previously failed due to visibility issues. A more reliable approach is to use keyboard navigation: press ArrowDown to move from “Fixed amount discount” to “Fixed amount discount for whole cart,” then confirm with Enter in the next step.

The user’s goal is to draft a new Cart Price Rule for a Mother’s Day sale that gives a $15 discount at checkout for all customers. I navigated to Marketing > Promotions > Cart Price Rules, clicked “Add New Rule”, filled out the form: set Rule Name to "Mother's Day Sale - $15 Off", Active = Yes, Websites = Main Website, Customer Groups = all (NOT LOGGED IN, General, Wholesale, Retailer), Coupon = No Coupon (auto-apply). In Actions, I set Apply = Fixed amount discount for whole cart and Discount Amount = 15. I saved the rule; the list page shows a success message “You saved the rule.” and displays the new rule in the grid. The best next action is to inform the user that the rule is created, including key configuration details, and offer to set dates or further restrictions if needed. Therefore, I will use send_msg_to_user to confirm completion and summarize settings.
