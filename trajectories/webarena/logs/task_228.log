The user asks for the price range of products from "sephora." I need to find all products on this site associated with "sephora" and then determine the lowest and highest prices among those results. The most efficient way is to use the site's search bar rather than browsing categories, as suggested by the tips. The current page shows a search combobox labeled "Search" with bid [386], and the Search button [391] is currently disabled, which likely enables when text is entered. So the next step is to input "Sephora" into the search field to bring up relevant results, then I can proceed to click search and analyze the resulting product list for prices.

The user is asking for the price range of products from Sephora. The homepage currently shows the search bar with the query "Sephora" already entered (combobox bid 386). To get the relevant product list and prices, I should execute the search. The Search button (bid 391) is visible next to the search field. Clicking it will load the search results page where I can review the prices and determine the minimum and maximum to provide the price range.

The user asks for the price range for products from Sephora. I’m already on the “Search results for: 'Sephora'” page showing 8 items with visible prices. To determine the range, I scan each product’s price in the results list:
- $94.99
- $60.73
- $60.95
- $31.38
- $18.18
- $56.31
- $10.99
