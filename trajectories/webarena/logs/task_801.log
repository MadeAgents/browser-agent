The user wants to create a new group named "crew" and add specific members. On the GitLab dashboard, the most direct path to create a group is through the "Create new..." menu in the top navigation bar. I can see the "Create new..." link labeled [141]. Clicking it should open a dropdown with options such as "New project" and "New group". My next step is to click this link to access the "New group" creation flow. After that, I will proceed to select "New group", name it "crew", create it, and then add members via the group's Members tab using the invite workflow, entering each username one at a time (ASWATFZLLC, patrickhlauke, westurner, linkmatrix). For now, I will trigger the menu by clicking "Create new...".

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to creating the group and then adding members.
- Required inputs:
  - Textbox “Group name” (node [261], required, editable; value not shown).
  - Textbox “Group URL” (node [271], required, editable) with base URL shown alongside.
- Visibility options:
  - Radio “Private” (node [280], unchecked).

  - Radio “Public” (node [296], checked).
- Personalization (optional for goal completion):
  - Combobox “Role” (node [311], value “Software Developer”).
- Informational banner with “Dismiss” button (node [505])—not required for progress.
- Breadcrumb links (nodes [510], [515]) confirm location (“New group” > “Create group”).

The next critical actions are to enter the group name “crew,” ensure the URL slug matches (“crew”), choose desired visibility, then submit the form to create the group. After creation, proceed to the group’s Members area to add users ASWATFZLLC, patrickhlauke, westurner, and linkmatrix.

The user wants to create a new group named "crew" and add specific members. I'm currently on the "Create group" form. The key fields are "Group name" (bid 261) and "Group URL" (bid 271). The visibility is already set to Public, which the user didn't specify differently, so it's acceptable to leave as-is. The next logical step is to enter the group name "crew" into the "Group name" textbox. Often, GitLab auto-populates the Group URL slug from the name, so I'll first fill the name and then verify/update the URL field if needed.

- This page is on the critical path to the goal (create the group, then add members).
- Relevant elements:
  - Textbox “Group name” (node [261], required): filled with “crew”.
  - Textbox “Group URL” (node [271], required): currently “crew3”; alert present (node [518]) stating “Group path is unavailable. Path has been replaced with a suggested available path.”
  - Visibility radios: “Public” (node [296]) checked; “Private” (node [280]) and “Internal” (node [288]) unchecked.
  - Submit control: “Create group” button is visible at the bottom of the form.
- The error indicates the slug “crew” is unavailable; proceeding with the suggested available slug is necessary to continue.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- In textbox “Group URL” (node [271]), accept the suggested available slug (e.g., ensure it is set to “crew3”) so the alert clears.
- Click the button labeled “Create group” to create the group.

The goal is to create a new group named "crew" and then add specified members. I'm on the "Create group" form, where the "Group name" field is already set to "crew". The "Group URL" slug is currently "crew3" due to the system indicating the desired "crew" path is unavailable and automatically suggesting an available path. Since the name matches the requested group name and the slug is acceptable to proceed, the best next step is to submit the form. The "Create group" button is present (bid 350). I will click it to create the group, and then proceed to the Members section to invite the listed users one by one in subsequent steps.

  - Action menu button next to group header (node [426], hasPopup=menu, expanded=False): visible; may include options such as inviting members.
  - Non-essential for the goal: “New subgroup” link (node [484]) and “New project” link (node [486]).
- No errors or off-track indicators present; the page is appropriate for the next step (adding members).

The group "crew" has been successfully created, as confirmed by the alert on the page. The next task is to add members.

The goal is to add two remaining members (westurner and linkmatrix) in the open “Invite members” modal for the "crew" group. The modal shows that ASWATFZLLC and patrickhlauke have already been added as tokens. To continue, I should use the "Username or email address" textbox [668] to add the next member. The effective approach is to type "westurner" into this field to trigger the suggestion dropdown, which I can select in a subsequent step. Since only one action is allowed per step, I will enter "westurner" now.

- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Button “Invite your colleagues” [399]: visible and enabled; opens the invite modal to add members.
  - Link “Group information” [269]: visible and enabled; expected area to verify/manage Members after inviting.
  - Tabs “Subgroups and projects” [499], “Shared projects” [501], “Archived projects” [503]: visible; not needed for member management.
- To confirm completion, navigate to “Group information” [269] and check the Members list to ensure the four users were added (default role currently “Guest”).

The user’s goal is to create a new group “crew” and add four specific members. The group has been created (path crew3), and I’ve already used the “Invite members” modal to add tokens for ASWATFZLLC, patrickhlauke, westurner, and linkmatrix, then clicked “Invite.” To ensure the task is fully completed, I should verify that these users now appear as members of the group. The most direct way is to navigate to the Group information area, which typically contains the Members page. On the current overview screen for the group, the left sidebar shows a “Group information” link (bid 269). Clicking it should take me to the section where I can confirm the members list or access the Members tab if needed. I’ll proceed by clicking “Group information.”

The user’s goal is to create a new group “crew” and add four members. From the prior steps, I’ve already navigated through GitLab’s “Create new…” > “New group” > “Create group” flow, set the group name to “crew,” and created it. The system assigned the path “crew3” since “crew” was unavailable. Then I opened the “Invite members” modal via “Invite your colleagues” and added all four specified usernames (ASWATFZLLC, patrickhlauke, westurner, linkmatrix) by selecting their suggestions and clicked “Invite.” The current page shows the group activity view, and previous attempts to click “Group information” didn’t navigate, but verification isn’t strictly required for the user’s stated goal. The task appears complete, so the best next step is to inform the user of completion with contextual details (group path and default role).

The user’s goal was to create a new group named “crew” and add four specified members. From the action history, I navigated through GitLab’s UI to create the group. The desired path “crew” was unavailable, so the system suggested “crew3.” I proceeded with that, keeping the group’s display name as “crew.” After creation, I opened the “Invite members” modal and successfully added the four usernames by selecting them from the suggestions: ASWATFZLLC, patrickhlauke, westurner, and linkmatrix. I then clicked the Invite button to submit the invitations. Now I should inform the user that the task is complete, including the path used and that the default role is Guest, and offer to adjust roles or verify members if needed. Since the page state is already at the group’s activity page and no further navigation is required, the best next action is to send a clear confirmation message to the user.
