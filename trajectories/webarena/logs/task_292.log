The user asks for the total number of cancellations for the customer who has the most cancellations in the store’s history. To determine this, I need access to all canceled orders and then identify which customer appears most frequently among them. The most straightforward place to access orders and filter by status is the SALES > Orders grid.

From the dashboard page, the top navigation bar includes a "SALES" link (element [156]). Clicking this should take me to the Orders grid where I can filter by status "Canceled" and then analyze the customer names to find the one with the highest occurrence. After reaching the Orders page, I can use filters and possibly sort/group by Customer Name, or manually count occurrences across pagination if needed. The first step is to navigate to SALES.

The user needs the total number of cancellations for the customer with the most cancellations across the store’s entire history. The best way to compute cancellations per customer is to use the Reports section, specifically a customer-related report that can filter by order status. The Task Tips indicate that the REPORTS tab has various reports and also mention that in reports, the order status selection UI is a 1-of-n selector. We likely need Reports > Customers > Order Count (or similar), set the date range from 01/01/2022 to today (since the store has operated since 2022), set Order Status to “Specified” and choose “Canceled,” then Show Report. From the report, we can identify the customer with the highest number of orders (cancellations) and read the count. 

Currently we’re on the Dashboard with the Sales menu expanded. To proceed, I should open the REPORTS menu first. The left navigation has a “REPORTS” link element [339]. Clicking it should expand the Reports submenu where I can find the appropriate customer report (Order Count).

✅ Current Progress: Opened the Reports menu from the Magento Admin dashboard. The Reports overlay is visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is on the critical path toward the goal. The Reports overlay shows relevant links under Customers:
- link 'Order Count' [417] — visible and clickable; this is the key report to find counts per customer.
- link 'Order Total' [414] — visible and clickable; less relevant for cancellations.
Other visible options (e.g., 'Orders' [383] under Sales) could list canceled orders but would require manual aggregation. Navigating to 'Order Count' [417] is the most direct path to get cancellations per customer (once filtered to Canceled status).

The goal is to determine the total number of cancellations for the customer with the most cancellations over the store’s entire history. The most efficient way in Magento is to use Reports > Customers > Order Count, then set the date range from 01/01/2022 to Today (as per tips stating store has operated since 2022), set Order Status to "Canceled" via the 1-of-n selection UI (select Specified then Canceled), and click Show Report. That report should list customers with the number of orders matching the status, allowing us to sort by "Number of Orders" to find the maximum cancellations and read the count.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is partially relevant but may not directly answer the goal. The Order Count Report lists orders per customer; however, no “Order Status” filter is present in the current UI, so cancellations cannot be isolated here. The table currently shows no data: “We can’t find records for this period.”
Relevant interactive elements:
- textbox “From:” [731] — visible, empty.
- textbox “To:” [738] — visible, empty.
- combobox “Show By:” [745] — value=Day, enabled.
- button “Refresh” [749] — visible, enabled.
- button “Scope: All Websites” [708] — visible, enabled.
- table results row [777] — shows “We can’t find records for this period.”

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Type a broad historical range into the date fields to populate data, then click the Refresh button: enter a start date into “From:” [731], enter today’s date into “To:” [738], and click “Refresh” [749].
- If cancellations still cannot be filtered on this report, navigate to the Sales area to use the Orders grid with status filtering: click the “SALES” link [156].

Goal: Find the total number of cancellations for the customer who has the most cancellations across the store’s entire history.

Current page: Reports > Customers > Order Count. Date range is set from 01/01/2022 to 12/18/2025, and the report is populated, but this report lacks an Order Status filter in the visible/accessibility tree. Without filtering by status “Canceled,” I can’t isolate cancellations, and manually aggregating across all rows would be inaccurate and inefficient.

Best approach: Use a report or grid that supports filtering by Order Status = Canceled. In Magento, Reports > Sales > Orders typically has an “Order Status” selector with a 1-of-n UI (as noted in the Task Tips), allowing me to specify “Canceled.” After filtering, I can analyze results to determine which customer has the most cancellations and then report that count. The current Customers Order Count report does not expose an Order Status control, so I should navigate to the Reports menu and choose the Sales > Orders report where status filters exist.

Next step: Open the Reports menu to access the Sales > Orders page. From there, I will set Order Status to Specified > Canceled, set the date range (already known to be the store’s full period), and run the report. Then I can identify the top customer by count of cancellations.

Goal: Find the total number of cancellations for the customer who has the most cancellations across the store’s entire history.

Current page: Reports > Customers > Order Count. Date range is set from 01/01/2022 to 12/18/2025, and the report is populated, but this report lacks an Order Status filter in the visible/accessibility tree. Without filtering by status “Canceled,” I can’t isolate cancellations, and manually aggregating across all rows would be inaccurate and inefficient.

Best approach: Use a report or grid that supports filtering by Order Status = Canceled. In Magento, Reports > Sales > Orders typically has an “Order Status” selector with a 1-of-n UI (as noted in the Task Tips), allowing me to specify “Canceled.” After filtering, I can analyze results to determine which customer has the most cancellations and then report that count. The current Customers Order Count report does not expose an Order Status control, so I should navigate to the Reports menu and choose the Sales > Orders report where status filters exist.

Next step: Open the Reports menu to access the Sales > Orders page. From there, I will set Order Status to Specified > Canceled, set the date range (already known to be the store’s full period), and run the report. Then I can identify the top customer by count of cancellations.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Reports > Customers > Order Count.
- Set full historical date range and refreshed the report.
- Opened the Reports menu again to locate a report that supports filtering by canceled status.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (Order Count Report under Reports > Customers) is not on the critical path because it lacks an “Order Status” filter; cancellations cannot be isolated here per the axtree.
- Relevant interactive elements to progress:
  - Reports > Sales menu [376] with link “Orders” [383] — visible and enabled.
  - Reports > Customers link “Order Count” [417] — visible; current page.
  - Top navigation “REPORTS” link [339] — focused.
- The “Orders” report under Reports > Sales is the appropriate next destination to filter by status “Canceled” and aggregate by customer.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the link “Orders” under Reports > Sales [383] to open the Orders report where you can filter by Order Status = “Canceled” and proceed to identify the customer with the most cancellations.

Task: Find the total number of cancellations for the customer who has the most cancellations in store history.

Assessment:
- We need a way to isolate canceled orders and attribute them to customers, then find the maximum count per customer.
- The current page is Reports > Customers > Order Count. It lists customers and orders by time interval but lacks an Order Status filter in the visible controls (From, To, Show By, Refresh, Export). Therefore, it cannot directly filter for “Canceled” orders.
- Based on Task Tips, Reports > Sales > Orders has an “Order Status” selector using a 1-of-n UI that allows choosing “Canceled.” That report is the best place to filter to canceled orders. After filtering, I can see if the report includes a Customer column or otherwise navigate to the Orders grid if necessary.
- Next step: Navigate to Reports > Sales > Orders to access the Order Status filter and set it to Canceled.

Plan:
1) Click Reports > Sales > Orders.
2) Set date range to the full history (already known: 01/01/2022 to today).
3) Set Order Status to Specified -> Canceled (1-of-n selection).
4) Generate the report and identify per-customer counts if available; if not, pivot to Sales > Orders grid to count per customer.

The user’s goal is to find the total number of cancellations for the customer with the most cancellations across the store’s history. I navigated to the Sales > Orders grid and applied the Status: Canceled filter (already present). The grid shows “147 records found” with per page set to 200 and only 1 page, so all canceled orders are visible at once—ideal for counting.

Since scrolling is not available, I relied on the accessibility tree of the orders table, which lists each canceled order row including the Bill-to Name (customer). I went through each row in the accessibility tree and tallied the occurrences of each customer. Key tallies included:
- Samantha Jones: 9
- Jane Smith: 7
- Sarah Miller: 7
- Julia Williams: 7
- Alexander Thomas: 7
- Alex Johnson: 7
- Others were at or below 6 (e.g., John Smith 6, Alex Martin 6, Daniel Jackson 6, Lily Potter 6, Grace Nguyen 6, etc.)

The maximum count observed is for Samantha Jones with 9 cancellations. The question asks only for the total number of cancellations of the customer who has the most cancellations, so the final answer is 9.

No further UI interaction is needed; I can now provide the answer directly.

The user’s goal is to find the total number of cancellations for the customer with the most cancellations across the store’s history. I navigated to the Sales > Orders grid and applied the Status: Canceled filter (already present). The grid shows “147 records found” with per page set to 200 and only 1 page, so all canceled orders are visible at once—ideal for counting.

Since scrolling is not available, I relied on the accessibility tree of the orders table, which lists each canceled order row including the Bill-to Name (customer). I went through each row in the accessibility tree and tallied the occurrences of each customer. Key tallies included:
- Samantha Jones: 9
- Jane Smith: 7
- Sarah Miller: 7
- Julia Williams: 7
- Alexander Thomas: 7
- Alex Johnson: 7
- Others were at or below 6 (e.g., John Smith 6, Alex Martin 6, Daniel Jackson 6, Lily Potter 6, Grace Nguyen 6, etc.)

The maximum count observed is for Samantha Jones with 9 cancellations. The question asks only for the total number of cancellations of the customer who has the most cancellations, so the final answer is 9.
