The user wants to open an issue in the "aem-hacker" project. Currently, the Dashboard lists many projects and includes a search filter field labeled "Filter by name" (element 273). Since the project isn’t visible in the current list, the fastest way is to use this filter to find "aem-hacker". According to the tips, using search or filters is recommended over scrolling. The next step is to type "aem-hacker" into the filter search box to narrow the list to that project.

✅ Current Progress: Filter applied on Projects page using the “Filter by name” search box with value ‘aem-hacker’.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the GitLab Projects dashboard, which is relevant for locating the aem-hacker project before opening an issue. However, the “Personal” scope appears active, showing “This user doesn’t have any personal projects,” so the filtered results are likely hidden. Key elements:
- searchbox labeled “Filter by name” (id: 273), value='aem-hacker', focused and enabled.
- link “All” (id: 311), visible and enabled.
- link “Personal” (id: 313), visible and likely selected (page indicates no personal projects).
- Global “Issues” link (id: 153) is visible but not specific to the aem-hacker project.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link with text “All” (id='311') to view all projects, then look for the aem-hacker project in the filtered results.

- The Projects dashboard is relevant and on the critical path to locating the “aem-hacker” project to open an issue.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Searchbox “Filter by name” (id: 273): filled with “aem-hacker”, visible and enabled.
  - Tab links: “All” (id: 311, clicked/active) and “Personal” (id: 313, visible).
  - Project result links within the list (e.g., items with heading/link patterns like ids 324, 361, 398, 435): visible; the specific “aem-hacker” project link is not yet visible/identified in the current view.
  - Global “Issues” link in the header (id: 153): visible but not specific to the target project, so not directly useful for opening an issue in “aem-hacker”.
- If the filtered project does not appear on the current page, pagination controls (visible in the view) may be necessary to navigate to the page containing the “aem-hacker” result.

The user’s goal is to open an issue in the aem-hacker project reporting the error “OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use” during executions. I have already navigated to the “New Issue” page for 0ang3el / aem-hacker. The title field is currently focused and is required. To proceed efficiently, I should first fill in the Title with a clear summary of the issue, then provide more details in the Description, and finally click “Create issue.” The immediate next step is to populate the Title field. The accessibility tree shows the title input as textbox “Title (required)” with bid 516, so I will fill that with an appropriate title that matches the user’s request.

The user wants to open an issue reporting the error in the aem-hacker project. We are already on the "New Issue" page with the Title field filled appropriately. The next logical step is to add a concise description detailing the experience of the error, which helps communicate context to maintainers. The description textbox is available with bid 594. I will fill it with a brief, clear report including observed behavior and expected behavior, then in the following step (after this single action), I can click "Create issue" (bid 638). Since only one action is allowed per step, filling the description now is the best next action.
