The user is asking for the price range for products from Perricone MD on the One Stop Market site. The most efficient way to find all Perricone MD products is to use the search bar rather than browsing categories, as per the tips. I see the search combobox labeled 'Search' with bid 386. The search button is currently disabled, which typically enables once text is entered. My next step is to enter "Perricone MD" into the search field to retrieve relevant results and then I can analyze prices on the results page.

Current content shows general “Product Showcases,” not Perricone MD-specific results yet. Executing the search is needed to view Perricone MD products and determine their price range.

✅ Current Progress: Search executed for “Perricone MD” and results page loaded, showing multiple Perricone MD products with visible prices (e.g., $35.00, $60.00, $129.00, $149.00). Initial visible bracket: $35.00–$149.00 on the first row, but full range not confirmed across all results.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to determine the brand’s price range. It shows “Items 1–12 of 175” search results, which include both Perricone MD items and unrelated “MD” items.
Relevant interactive elements:
- Sort By combobox (id/index 1500): value “Relevance”, options include “Price”; enabled, collapsed.
- “Set Ascending Direction” link (id/index 1504): enabled; toggles sort order.
- “View as List” link (id/index 1492): enabled; may make prices easier to scan.
- Product links and prices (visible):
  - “Perricone MD Cold Plasma Plus” (link id/index 1518): price $149.00.
  - “Perricone MD No Makeup Eyeshadow”: price $35.00.
  - “Perricone MD No Makeup Foundation Serum Broad Spectrum …”: price $60.00.
  - “Perricone MD Essential FX Acyl-Glutathione Essential Starter Kit”: price $129.00.
Observation: Because the results include non-Perricone items, using sorting by Price (and possibly Advanced Search link id/index 390) or filtering is important to accurately capture the minimum and maximum prices for Perricone MD only.

The user wants the price range for products from Perricone MD. The current search results for "Perricone MD" include many unrelated items that match "MD" (e.g., electronics and clothing), which would distort the price range. To isolate Perricone MD products, I should use the left-side "Shop By" filters. There is a "Category" filter link for "Beauty & Personal Care (13 item)", which is the likely category for Perricone MD skincare and makeup products. Clicking this filter will narrow the results to relevant items. Once filtered, I can then examine the visible prices and, if needed, adjust "Show per page" to 24 to see all 13 items on one page for accurate min/max.

Some items are not Perricone MD (e.g., MD Complete, Dr. Dennis Gross), so I must only consider titles beginning with "Perricone MD."

From page 1, Perricone MD items/prices observed:
- Perricone MD Cold Plasma Plus — $149.00
- Perricone MD No Makeup Eyeshadow 0.3 Ounce — $35.00
- Perricone MD No Makeup Foundation Serum Broad Spectrum — $60.00
- Perricone MD Essential Fx Acyl-Glutathione Essential Starter Kit, 3 ct. — $129.00

Preliminary range: $35–$149, but there are 13 items total; to confirm if any Perricone MD product is cheaper than $35 or more expensive than $149, I need to check page 2. The pagination control shows "Page 2" (bid 1920). Clicking that will display the remaining item(s) so I can identify any Perricone MD product affecting min/max.
