The user's goal is to modify the address for order #300. To do this in Magento Admin, I need to navigate to the Orders list under the Sales section, locate order #300, open it, and then edit the address fields. Currently, I'm on the Dashboard page, and the left-side navigation menu shows a "SALES" link. The first step is to access the Sales section where the Orders page is located. Clicking the "SALES" menu item should reveal or navigate to the Orders area, enabling me to proceed to find order #300. Therefore, the best next action is to click the "SALES" link.

The goal is to update the shipping address for order #300 to “987 Cedar Court, Los Angeles, CA, 90012.” I’m on the Order Address Information edit page, and the Street Address has already been updated to “987 Cedar Court.” The remaining fields to change are City, State/Province, and Zip/Postal Code. The City field [1090] currently shows “Cambridge,” so the next logical step is to update it to “Los Angeles” before selecting California and setting the ZIP to 90012, and finally saving the changes.

The user wants the shipping address of order #300 set to “987 Cedar Court, Los Angeles, CA, 90012.” I’m on the Order Address Information edit page, and I can see the form fields. The Street Address has already been updated to “987 Cedar Court,” and the City is set to “Los Angeles.” The Country is “United States,” which is correct. The State/Province is currently “Massachusetts,” but it needs to be changed to “California.” The Zip/Postal Code is “02138,” and will need to be updated to “90012” after changing the state. Since only one action is allowed per step, the best next action is to change the State/Province combobox [1018] to “California,” then I will update the ZIP and save in subsequent steps.

The task is to modify the address of order #300 to “987 Cedar Court, Los Angeles, CA, 90012.” I’m on the Order Address Information edit page (address_id/599), and I’ve already updated:
- Street Address line 1 [756] to “987 Cedar Court”
- City [1090] to “Los Angeles”
- State/Province [1018] to “California”
- Zip/Postal Code [1095] to “90012”
Country is already “United States.” The form shows a second street address textbox [758] that appears marked required in the accessibility tree, but typically Magento only requires the first line; the page should indicate if saving fails due to missing data. The next logical step is to attempt to save the changes using the “Save Order Address” button [703]. If a validation error occurs, I can then address the secondary street line.
