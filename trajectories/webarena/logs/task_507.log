The user’s goal is to complete the purchase of the highest rated ceiling light above 1000. We already added the highest rated item ($1,108.00, 100% rating) to the cart and are now on the Checkout page at the Shipping step. The page shows a selected shipping address (Emma Lopez) and the “Fixed Flat Rate” shipping method is already selected (radio checked=true). The “Next” button (bid 816) is visible and enabled, which should advance the checkout to the “Review & Payments” step where I can finalize payment and place the order. Given the previous timeout was on a different button but we successfully reached Checkout, the appropriate next action is to click “Next”.
