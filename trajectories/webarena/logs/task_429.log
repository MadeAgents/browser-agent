The user wants the OpenStreetMap pages for the colleges where “The Chair” was filmed in Pittsburgh. To retrieve specific college pages on OSM, the most efficient approach is to use the built-in search field rather than trying to pan the map. The search textbox [162] is already focused. I will start by searching for one of the known filming colleges in Pittsburgh—Chatham University—since it is a commonly cited filming location for The Chair. After entering the term, I will click Go in a subsequent step to view results, then proceed to open the details page. I will repeat similarly for other Pittsburgh colleges if needed (e.g., University of Pittsburgh or Carnegie Mellon University), but first I need to get the search results for Chatham University.

The goal is to find the OpenStreetMap pages for the colleges where "The Chair" was filmed in Pittsburgh. Known filming locations include Chatham University and Carnegie Mellon University within Pittsburgh. The search box [162] is already filled with “Chatham University Pittsburgh,” which is a primary filming site. To proceed, I should execute the search by clicking the “Go” button [165] to bring up the search results, from which I can select the exact Chatham University page. After this, I can perform additional searches for other colleges (e.g., Carnegie Mellon University) in subsequent steps. The welcome overlay doesn’t block the search controls, so clicking Go is the next best action.
