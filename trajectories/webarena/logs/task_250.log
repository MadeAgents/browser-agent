The user wants the coordinates in decimal degrees (DD) for the Apple Store near Pitt (University of Pittsburgh). On OpenStreetMap, the best way is to use the search bar rather than scrolling. The current page shows the search textbox focused (bid 162) and a Go button (bid 165). The Apple Store closest to Pitt is Apple Shadyside in Pittsburgh. I will first enter a precise query like "Apple Shadyside, Pittsburgh" into the search box to bring up the relevant location, then in subsequent steps I can click Go and select the correct result to view its coordinates.

The user wants the coordinates (decimal degrees) of the Apple Store near Pitt (University of Pittsburgh). On OpenStreetMap, we already set the search query to "Apple Shadyside, Pittsburgh", which is the Apple Store closest to Pitt. The next step is to execute the search by clicking the "Go" button. This should bring up search results or directly focus the relevant place.

Goal: Provide coordinates (decimal degrees, DD) for the Apple Store near Pitt (University of Pittsburgh). On OpenStreetMap, the nearby store is "Apple Shadyside" on Walnut Street. We already filled the search box with "Apple Shadyside, Pittsburgh" and clicked "Go". The left pane shows "Search Results" with a loading spinner, which suggests results are being fetched but not yet displayed. To progress, I should re-trigger the search to ensure the results load, as the map is currently centered in Singapore (indicating potential location bias). Clicking the "Go" button again is a reasonable next step to prompt the results to appear, after which I can click the correct result to obtain the coordinates from the place details or the Share panel. Avoid navigating away (e.g., Nominatim link) or using the Share button now (it would give Singapore coordinates). Therefore, I will click the Go button again.

The user wants the coordinates (decimal degrees) of the Apple Store near Pitt. On the OpenStreetMap page, the search results panel shows a single relevant result: "Electronics Shop Apple Store, Walnut Street, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15206, United States" with element id 494. Clicking this result should center the map on the Apple Store and place a marker for that feature. Once focused on the feature, I can use the Share tool to obtain the exact latitude and longitude. Since only one action is allowed per step, the best next action is to click the search result link (id 494) to open/select the Apple Store feature.
