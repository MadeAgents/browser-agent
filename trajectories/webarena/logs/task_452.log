✅ Current Progress: The profile/account menu has been opened from the GitLab dashboard, exposing profile-related options needed to change profile settings.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This is the GitLab Projects dashboard, but the expanded profile menu is on the critical path to set the homepage URL. Relevant elements in the menu:
- [201] link "Byte Blaze" — profile control; expanded=True (menu open).
- [217] link "Edit profile" — visible and interactive; this is the correct entry point to update the homepage URL.
- [219] link "Preferences" — visible; not required for homepage URL.
- [215] button "Edit status" — visible; unrelated to the goal.

The user’s goal is to set the homepage URL on their GitLab profile to byteblaze.github.io. We’re currently on the GitLab Dashboard with the profile menu already expanded (expanded=True for the "Byte Blaze" link). Within this dropdown, I can see the "Edit profile" option (bid 217). According to the provided task tips, to edit the profile we should click the profile button and then "Edit profile." Since the dropdown is already open and "Edit profile" is visible, the next best step is to click "Edit profile" to navigate to the profile editing page where I can locate the homepage/website field and set the URL. I should not scroll or use the global search. I'll proceed to click the "Edit profile" link.

The user wants to set their GitLab profile homepage URL to byteblaze.github.io. I am already on the Edit Profile page where the Website url field is visible. In the accessibility tree, the Website url textbox is [556] and currently contains "https://www.byteblaze.com". To update it, I should replace this value with the desired URL. Many forms require a full URL with scheme, and the current field uses "https://", so to ensure successful validation while matching the intended destination, I'll enter "https://byteblaze.github.io". After updating the field, I will then need to save via the "Update profile settings" button [597], but since only one action is allowed per step, the next best single action is to fill the Website url textbox with the new URL.
