- Bulk selection and actions:
  - table header checkbox [1748] — unchecked; can select all rows shown.
  - button ‘Actions’ [1403] — visible/enabled; for bulk operations after selecting filtered items.
- Grid/pagination:
  - ‘per page’ textbox [1433] set to 200 (covers all 149 items).
  - pagination shows ‘of 1’ [1463], so all results fit on one page.
- Relevant columns present for filtering/verification: ‘Name’ [1765], ‘Manufacturer’ [1785], ‘Status’ [1781], etc.

The task is to mark all Hollister shirts on sale. I’m on the Catalog > Products grid. There is an active filter “Quantity: 0 - 0”, which restricts the grid to only products with zero quantity. This could hide some Hollister shirts if any have non-zero stock. To ensure I capture all Hollister items for bulk updating (likely via Actions > Update Attributes to toggle a “sale” attribute), I should first clear the active filter. After that, I can use the “Search by keyword” to find “Hollister”, select all results, and proceed with mass attribute update. Given only one action is allowed per step, the best immediate action is to click “Clear all” to remove the restrictive quantity filter.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Catalog > Products and cleared previous filters.
- Ran a keyword search for “Hollister,” then refined to “Hollister shirt” and applied the search.
- Current result set is empty (0 records); no products selected or updated as on sale yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The Products grid is the correct place to bulk-mark items on sale, but the current filter (“Keyword: Hollister shirt”) returns no results, blocking progress.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - textbox “Search by keyword” [1397] — value='Hollister shirt', visible.
  - button “Search” [1398] — enabled/visible.
  - Active filter chip “Keyword: Hollister shirt” with remove button [9916] — visible.
  - button “Clear all” [914] — visible/enabled to reset filters.
  - button “Filters” [902] — visible/enabled (for advanced filtering if needed).
  - Grid select checkbox [1748] and “Options” header controls — disabled due to no rows.
  - button “Actions” [1403] — visible but requires selected products.
  - Records count shows “0 records found.”

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button “Clear all” [914] to remove the zero-result keyword filter.
- Type “Hollister” into textbox “Search by keyword” [1397], then click button “Search” [1398] to retrieve Hollister products for identifying shirts and proceeding with bulk update.

The task is to mark all Hollister shirts on sale. I’m on the Catalog > Products page with the keyword filter set to “Hollister shirt,” which currently returns 0 records. Since the keyword search is too restrictive, a better approach is to use the Filters panel to precisely filter by Manufacturer = Hollister and potentially by Category = Shirts. This should surface all relevant Hollister shirts even if their names don’t contain the word “shirt.” The next step is to open the Filters panel so I can set those filters.

The goal is to mark all Hollister shirts on sale. I’m on the Products grid where the current keyword filter “Hollister shirt” returns 0 records. To proceed effectively, I should clear this restrictive keyword filter and then use the Filters panel to set Manufacturer to "Hollister" and Name to "shirt," which will better capture all Hollister shirts. The immediate next step is to remove the active keyword filter. The page shows an active filter chip “Keyword: Hollister shirt” and a “Clear all” button [914]. Clicking “Clear all” will remove the keyword filter and restore the product list, enabling me to apply more precise filters next. This avoids repeated ineffective actions; my last action was opening the Filters panel [902], not clearing filters yet. So the best next action is to click “Clear all.”

Task: Mark all Hollister shirts on sale.

We are on Catalog > Products with filters panel visible. To identify Hollister shirts, the best approach is to filter by Manufacturer = Hollister, and possibly further narrow by Attribute Set = Top and/or Type = Configurable Product. Once the correct subset is shown, we can select all and use Actions > Update Attributes to toggle the "sale" attribute on for all.

First step now: open the Manufacturer combobox to select "Hollister". The Manufacturer field is visible as a combobox [1073]. I need to expand it to see/select "Hollister". After that, I will select the "Hollister" option, apply filters, and proceed.

The user wants to mark all Hollister shirts on sale. I’m on the Products grid filtered by keyword “Hollister,” showing 16 records, which include a configurable product “Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt” and its simple variants. To mark products “on sale,” per the tips, configurable products have options like “sale” that can be toggled on/off. Since I need to set a sale flag across Hollister shirts, starting with the configurable product makes sense to apply the sale option at the parent level (and potentially affect its variants depending on the site’s attribute setup).

The grid lists “Edit Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt” link [9962]. Clicking this will open the product edit page where I can look for the “sale” toggle in the product’s options and enable it, then save. This is a more direct path than trying to refine filters further, given the manufacturer combobox selection did not work earlier and “Hollister shirt” returned 0 results. I will proceed to edit the configurable product now.

I will click the “Edit Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt” link to open the product edit page.

- No Hollister shirts have been marked “on sale” yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Current page is a single product edit screen for a sweatshirt, not a shirt; this is off the critical path to “mark all Hollister shirts on sale.”
- Relevant interactive elements on this page:
  - Heading: “Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt” [846].
  - Save button [904] — visible/enabled.
  - Save options button [906] — visible.

Objective: Mark all Hollister shirts on sale. I’m currently on the edit page for “Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt,” which is a sweatshirt, not a shirt.

  - Filters toggle button id=902 (visible/enabled) — use to refine to shirts.
  - Search by keyword textbox id=1397 (value='Hollister', visible) and Search button id=1398 (enabled) — currently limits results to Hollister items but not specifically shirts.

  - Records count indicator shows “16 records found”; pagination controls indicate 1 page (spinbutton id=1463 value=1; nav buttons id=1462/id=1465 disabled).
- Observation: Results are filtered to “Hollister” but not yet narrowed to “shirts,” so additional filtering (e.g., via Filters panel for Name contains “shirt” or category) is needed before performing a bulk action.

The goal is to mark all Hollister shirts on sale. Currently, the Products grid is filtered by keyword "Hollister" and shows 16 records, which are all "Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt" and its variants—these are sweatshirts, not shirts. To specifically target shirts, I should use the Filters panel to refine results by Category = Shirts (and optionally Manufacturer = Hollister). After narrowing down to the correct Hollister shirts, I can select them and use Actions > Update Attributes to toggle the "sale" option on.

The Filters panel is accessed via the "Filters" button (bid=902). My last action (clicking Back on a product edit page) timed out, but I am on the products grid with the filter chip "Keyword: Hollister" visible. The next best step is to open the Filters panel to set Category and/or Manufacturer. Therefore, I will click the Filters button to open the panel.

Objective: Mark all Hollister shirts on sale.

Current page: Catalog > Products with Filters panel visible. There is an active keyword filter "Hollister" (chip shown), and the results are predominantly "Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt" items, which are not shirts. To find shirts, I should refine filters. The Manufacturer combobox selection previously failed using select_option, so I will avoid repeating that. A pragmatic next step is to use the "Name" filter field within the Filters panel to search for "shirt" to identify shirt products. Later, I can adjust filters further (e.g., manufacturer) or clear the keyword filter if needed.

Plan:
1) Enter "shirt" into the Name field in the Filters panel.
2) Apply Filters to see shirt results.
3) If needed, further filter by manufacturer or adjust keyword.
4) Select all filtered Hollister shirts and use Actions > Update Attributes to toggle "sale" on.

Goal: Mark all Hollister shirts on sale. I'm on the Catalog > Products grid with filters "Keyword: Hollister" and "Name: shirt," showing 16 records. To bulk update, I need to select all filtered products and then use Actions > Update Attributes to toggle the "sale" option.

Previous attempt to click the master checkbox (bid 1748) failed because the "Options" button (bid 1750) intercepts pointer events. The Magento grid typically provides a selection dropdown next to the master checkbox to choose "Select All" or similar. Therefore, the correct next step is to click the "Options" button to open the selection dropdown, which will allow selecting all items on the page in the next step.

I will click the "Options" button now.
