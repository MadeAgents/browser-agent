The user asks for the customer with the most cancellations across the store’s history. In Magento, the best way is to use a report filtered by order status “Canceled”. The Task Tips mention the Reports section and the 1-of-n status selector, and also that we can generate various reports via the REPORTS tab, with date ranges from Jan 1, 2022 to Today for full history.

Plan:
1) Navigate to REPORTS from the top menu.
2) Look for a customer-centric report that can filter by order status—ideally “Customers by number of orders” (often named “Order Count”) or a similar report that supports filtering by order status “Canceled”.
3) Set date range from 01/01/2022 to Today to cover full history.
4) Choose “Specified” for Order Status and select “Canceled” (remember the 1-of-n selection UI quirk).
5) Click “Show Report”.
6) Sort by Orders descending if possible and identify the customer with the highest count.

First step: click REPORTS in the top menu.

The goal is to find the customer with the most cancellations across the store’s history. The Reports overlay is open, and under the Customers section there is an "Order Count" report link, which is likely the best tool to aggregate counts per customer. From experience and task tips, many Magento reports allow filtering by Order Status, including selecting "Canceled" using a 1-of-n style selector. Once inside Order Count, I can set the full historical date range (from 01/01/2022 to today) and choose the "Canceled" status to compute per-customer counts, then identify the highest. The next step is to enter the Order Count report by clicking the "Order Count" link (id 417) from the Reports overlay.

The user asks for the customer with the most cancellations across the store’s history. To determine cancellations specifically, I need a report that filters by Order Status = Canceled. The current page is the Customers > Order Count report, which shows counts per customer but does not provide an order status filter, so it cannot isolate canceled orders.

Per the Task Tips, the Orders report under REPORTS > Sales supports a “Specified” Order Status selection with a 1-of-n UI including “Canceled”. The plan is:
1) Open REPORTS > Sales > Orders.
2) Set the date range from 01/01/2022 to today to cover full history.
3) Choose “Specified” and select “Canceled”.
4) Refresh/Show the report.
5) From the resulting data, identify which customer appears with the highest count of canceled orders. If the report lists per-order entries, I will use the table to determine counts by customer.

The next immediate step is to navigate to the Sales > Orders report. The Reports menu is already visible, and the “Orders” link has bid 383. I will click it to proceed.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Reports > Sales > Orders Report.
- Determined this report excludes canceled orders (per on-page note), so it cannot be used to identify cancellations.
- Earlier attempted Customers > Order Count report, which also lacked an order status filter for cancellations.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page: “Orders Report / Sales / Reports / Magento Admin.” This page is not suitable for the goal because canceled orders are explicitly excluded.
- Relevant interactive elements (visible/enabled):
  - Combobox “Order Status” (id: 783), value: “Any” — note: “Applies to Any of the Specified Order Statuses except canceled orders.”
  - Date range fields “From” (id: 769, empty, required) and “To” (id: 776, empty, required).
  - Button “Show Report” (id: 726), enabled.
  - Top menubar link “SALES” (id: 157), enabled — needed to access the Orders grid where filtering by Status = Canceled is possible.
- Off-track: This Orders Report cannot include canceled orders, so continuing here will not answer the question.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the top menubar link “SALES” (id='157') to open the Sales section and then proceed to the Orders grid to filter by Status = “Canceled” and aggregate by customer.

Goal: Identify the customer with the most canceled orders across the store’s history.

Current page: Reports > Sales > Orders Report. The UI explicitly states this report excludes canceled orders (“Applies to Any of the Specified Order Statuses except canceled orders”), so this path cannot yield cancellations. Earlier, I tried the Customers > Order Count report, but it lacked an order status filter for isolating canceled orders. Therefore, the Reports section isn’t suitable.

Alternative: Use the Sales > Orders grid, which supports filtering by Status = Canceled. Then, within the filtered results (full history by default), I can review the Customer column and determine who appears most often. This likely requires navigating to the Sales section first, then choosing Orders.

Plan:
1) Click the top menubar “SALES”.
2) In Sales > Orders grid, filter Status = Canceled.
3) Tally occurrences per customer and identify the top name.

Next step: Click the SALES menu link to access the Orders grid.

Task: Identify the customer with the most cancellations in store history.

Context: We’re on Sales > Orders grid with Status filtered to “Canceled” and 147 records found on one page (per page 200), so we have the full canceled order list visible. The grid shows Bill-to Name for each canceled order.

Approach: Manually tally the frequency of each Bill-to Name across all canceled orders listed in the accessibility tree. I read through each row entry from the “Canceled” dataset and incremented counts per customer.

Key tallies (top results):
- Samantha Jones: 9 canceled orders (highest)
- Tied at 7: Sarah Miller (7), Julia Williams (7), Alexander Thomas (7), Alex Johnson (7), Jane Smith (7)
- At 6: Lily Potter (6), Grace Nguyen (6), Alex Martin (6), Daniel Jackson (6), John Smith (6)
- Others at 5: Olivia Lee (5), Brian Smith (5), Jane Doe (5), Adam Garcia (5), Lisa Kim (5)

Conclusion: The customer with the most cancellations is Samantha Jones, with 9 canceled orders.

I will now report the name succinctly to the user.
