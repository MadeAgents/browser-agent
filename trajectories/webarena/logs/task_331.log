🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to determining July 2022 spending. The Orders table ([1474], caption “Orders”) shows columns Order #, Date, Order Total, Status, Action. Currently visible rows are dated in 2023 (e.g., 5/17/23, 5/2/23), so July 2022 entries are not yet in view. The page indicates “Items 1 to 10 of 37 total,” implying older orders exist. Relevant interactive elements:
- “View Order” links in each row ([1491], [1502], [1513], etc.) — visible/enabled; open individual order details.
- “Reorder” links ([1493], [1504], [1515], etc.) — visible/enabled; not needed for this task.
- Search components at the top: combobox “Search” ([380]) and “Search” button ([385], disabled) — not relevant to order history.
No deviation detected; continue using the Orders table navigation (pagination or “Show … per page” control visible near the table) to reach July 2022 orders.

The user asks: “How much I spend in July 2022 on shopping at One Stop Market?” I need to find all orders placed in July 2022 in the order history and sum their “Order Total” amounts.

✅ Current Progress:
- Reached the “My Orders” page and paginated to older entries.
- Identified July 2022 orders on the previous page (page 3): at least one completed order for $40.16 and one canceled order (excluded from spend).
- Currently on page 4 (items 31–37 of 37), which shows June 2022 and earlier; total July 2022 spending not yet finalized.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path (order history), but the current pagination view (page 4, items 31–37) shows dates including 6/30/22, 5/22/22, and April 2022—no July 2022 entries.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Orders table “Orders” [1474] with columns “Order #”, “Date”, “Order Total”, “Status”, “Action” — visible.
  - Example row on this page: Date gridcell [1486] “6/30/22”, Order Total gridcell [1487] “$173.56”, Status gridcell [1489] “Canceled”; “View Order” link [1491] — enabled/visible.
  - Pagination controls (links with visible text “1”, “2”, “3”, “4”) at bottom — enabled/visible; “3” should return to July 2022 entries.
- To compute July 2022 spend, we must return to page 3 and sum “Order Total” values for rows where Date is in July 2022 and Status is not “Canceled”.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the pagination link labeled “3” (bottom of the Orders table) to return to July 2022 entries.
- On the “Orders” table [1474], add up the “Order Total” amounts for all rows with Date in July 2022 and Status not “Canceled” (ignore canceled orders like the 7/25/22 entry).

The user wants total spending in July 2022. I'm on My Orders page, currently page 3 (items 21–30 of 37), which includes July entries. The visible July 2022 rows are:
- 7/25/22 — $354.66 — Status: Canceled (exclude from spend)
- 7/8/22 — $40.16 — Status: Complete (include)

I previously navigated to page 4 and observed dates up to 6/30/22 and earlier, indicating no additional July entries there. Therefore, the only July non-canceled purchase is $40.16. Per instructions, for “How much is spent,” I should return just the decimal.
