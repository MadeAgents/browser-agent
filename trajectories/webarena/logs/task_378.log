The user wants parking around CMU main campus. We’re on OpenStreetMap centered on Singapore. The best approach is to use the OSM search box to query for parking near Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. The search textbox element (bid 162) is already focused. I will enter a query like "parking near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" to bring up relevant results. After that, in the next step, I can click the "Go" button to execute the search and then review the results for nearby parking options.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap’s main interface and is on the critical path to the goal. Relevant interactive elements:
- Textbox labeled “Search” (node [162]): focused, filled with the query.
- Button “Go” (node [165]): visible and enabled; will execute the search.
- Button “Close” (node [217]): visible; closes the “Welcome to OpenStreetMap!” overlay which may obstruct viewing results.
- Link “Find directions between two points” (node [167]): visible; not needed for this task.
The map is currently centered away from CMU (shows Singapore), indicating the search hasn’t been executed yet.

The user’s goal is to find parking around CMU main campus. I already filled the search box with “parking near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA.” The next logical step is to execute the search using the “Go” button to bring up results. Although there’s a “Welcome to OpenStreetMap!” overlay with a Close button, executing the search should either replace the left panel with results or I can close it afterward if needed. Therefore, I will click the Go button (bid 165) to perform the search.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page (OpenStreetMap) is on the critical path to the goal. The left panel shows “Search Results” (heading [475]) from Nominatim with relevant, clickable results:
- [481] link: “Forbes Avenue, Squirrel Hill North, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States” (Parking) — visible, enabled.

Other relevant controls:
- Search textbox [162] still filled with the query; “Go” button [165] present.
- “Close” button [209] for an overlay is visible (may be obscuring part of the map but not the results).
The map area reflects the CMU vicinity and is interactive (zoom controls [434]/[436], layers [442], etc.). No deviation detected; the results list contains multiple CMU-adjacent parking options.
