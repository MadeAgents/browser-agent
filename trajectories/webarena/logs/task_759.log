The user wants the route and driving time from the city where their E-commerce customer Sophia Young lives to New York City. I need the starting city, which is not provided. The likely source is the e-commerce admin site, accessible via the homepage.

✅ Current Progress: No progress made yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is a blank new tab (axtree shows only RootWebArea, focused) and does not contain any interactive elements. This page is not on the critical path toward the goal because we first need to identify Sophia Young’s city from the E‑commerce system, then use a mapping service to get the route and driving time to New York City. Relevant interactive elements: none present (no inputs, buttons, or links visible/enabled).

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- The page is unrelated to the goal. Use browser navigation to load the E‑commerce admin/customer page to locate Sophia Young and read her city.
- After obtaining the city, navigate to a maps site and use its directions form to enter “From: [Sophia Young’s city]” and “To: New York City,” then read the route and driving time.

The goal is to show the route and driving time from Sophia Young’s city to New York City. From the Magento Admin tab, I identified Sophia Young’s city as Boston, Massachusetts. I’m now on the OpenStreetMap directions panel with “Car” selected and OSRM as the routing service, and I see the “From” [194] and “To” [199] textboxes. To proceed, I should first input the origin (Boston, MA) into the “From” field, then input the destination (New York City) into the “To” field, and finally trigger route calculation (typically by pressing Enter on the “To” field). The immediate next step is to fill the “From” textbox with “Boston, MA”.
