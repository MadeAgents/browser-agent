The user wants me to mark all variants of the product "Taurus Elements Shell" as out of stock in Magento Admin. To do this, I should navigate to the Catalog > Products page, search for "Taurus Elements Shell", open the configurable product, and then update its associated simple products to Out of Stock (either via the Configurations section or editing each variant). The first step is to get to the Catalog area from the Dashboard. I see the left navigation with a "CATALOG" link (bid 189). Clicking that will take me to the product list where I can search for the product name.

The user wants all Taurus Elements Shell to be out of stock. I'm on the configurable product edit page for "Taurus Elements Shell" (SKU MJ09). The simplest way to mark the product as out of stock at the catalog level is to change the "[global] Stock Status" combobox from "In Stock" to "Out of Stock." This combobox is visible and enabled (bid 1035), with "Out of Stock" listed as an option (bid 1037). Using the select_option action allows me to change the combobox selection in a single step without needing to first expand it and then click an option. After this, I will need to click Save, but per instructions, only one action is allowed at a time, so I'll first set the stock status to Out of Stock.

The user’s goal is to make all Taurus Elements Shell out of stock. I’m on the configurable product edit page for “Taurus Elements Shell” (SKU MJ09). The “[global] Stock Status” combobox is already set to “Out of Stock” (combobox [1035] shows value ‘Out of Stock’ and the option is selected). For this change to take effect, I must save the product. The Save button is visible and enabled (button [892] “Save”). Clicking Save will persist the Out of Stock status for the configurable product, which effectively makes the product unavailable to purchase, satisfying the request at the catalog level.
