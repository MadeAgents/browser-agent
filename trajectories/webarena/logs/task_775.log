I have already filtered the reviews by Nickname = "Arden," selected the single matching review (1 selected), chose the bulk action "Delete," and clicked "Submit." The page now shows a confirmation dialog titled "Are you sure?" with two buttons: "Cancel" and "OK." To finalize the deletion, I need to confirm the action by clicking "OK." This will complete the bulk delete operation for the selected review(s).

<action>
```click("1227")```
</action>
