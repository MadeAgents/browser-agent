The user wants a new GitLab repository named "nolan_young_fans" and to include, in its README, movies directed by Christopher Nolan after 2010. I'm currently on the GitLab Projects dashboard. The first step is to create the new project. On this page, there is a "New project" button/link identified in the accessibility tree as [252] link 'New project' in the main area near the top right. Clicking this should take me to the project creation flow where I can set the project name and (ideally) initialize with a README. After the project is created, I can edit the README to add the list of Nolan films released after 2010 (The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Interstellar (2014), Dunkirk (2017), Tenet (2020), Oppenheimer (2023)). For now, the next best single action is to click the "New project" button to start the creation process.

The user’s goal is to have a GitLab repository named “nolan_young_fans” with a README listing Christopher Nolan movies released after 2010. I’m currently on the project page for Byte Blaze / nolan_young_fans. The Files table shows README.md, and the rendered README content includes: The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Interstellar (2014), Dunkirk (2017), Tenet (2020), and Oppenheimer (2023). This matches the requested content. Since the repository exists and the README already contains the correct list, the task is completed. The best next step is to inform the user and provide the repository link for reference.
