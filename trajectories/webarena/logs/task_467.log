The user wants to add a specific product to their wish list. The fastest way to locate a specific product is to use the site’s search bar rather than browsing categories, as per the general tips. On the current homepage, I see the search combobox labeled 'Search' (element [273]) and the 'Search' button (currently disabled). I should first enter the exact product name into the search field; typically, this will enable the search button or trigger suggestions. After filling, I can proceed to click the search button in the next step, then navigate to the matching product and use the "Add to Wish List" link on its page.

The user wants the specific product added to their wish list. I already entered the exact product name into the search field (combobox [273]). The next logical step is to execute the search to locate the product. The page shows a "Search" button (element [278]) next to the search field. Clicking it should navigate to the search results page where I can find the product and then use the "Add to Wish List" option. I’ll click the search button now to proceed.

The user wants to add a specific product to their wish list. We are already on the search results page showing the exact target product as the first item: “HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set for Mens, Summer Tropical Tree Printed Relaxed-fit Hawaii Shirts Shorts 2 Piece Suits.” In the same list item, there is a dedicated “Add to Wish List” button ([1431]). Since the user is logged in (header shows “Welcome, Emma Lopez!” and “Sign Out”), clicking this button should add the item directly to the wish list without needing to open the product detail page. This is the most direct and efficient path to complete the task.
