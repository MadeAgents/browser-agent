To start creating a new project, the logical first step is to click this "New project" link. From there, I expect to be taken to a project creation form where I can specify the project name and visibility (set to private).

✅ Current Progress: Reached the “Create new project” selection page, but project creation has not started. The last click targeted a non-interactive heading, so no change occurred.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to create a new project. Relevant interactive elements:
- [241] link: “Create blank project” — visible; primary path to start a new project.
- [248] link: “Create from template” — visible; optional path if using templates.
- [255] link: “Import project” — visible; for migrations.
- [263] link: “Show command” — visible; for command-line instructions.
To meet the goal (new private project “planner”), the “Create blank project” link [241] is the appropriate next step.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the link [241] “Create blank project” to open the project creation form.

✅ Current Progress:

- Visibility set to Private ([320] checked).
- Attempted to create the project, but submission failed with validation errors. No project created; members (Abishek, Vinta) not added.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page: “Create blank project” form — still on the critical path to the goal.
- Server returned errors ([239]/[240]):
  - “Project namespace name has already been taken”
  - “Name has already been taken”
  - “Path has already been taken”
- Relevant elements and state:
  - [274] textbox “Project name” — value='planner', required.
  - [304] textbox “Project slug” — value='planner', required.
  - [280]/[284] Project URL namespace selector — button with popup menu, collapsed; current base shown as “http://10.177.37.113:8023/”.
  - Visibility radios — “Private” [320] checked (correct); “Internal” [328] unchecked; “Public” [336] unchecked.
  - [347] checkbox “Initialize repository with a README” — checked (optional).
  - [357] button “Create project” — visible/enabled.
- The errors indicate name and slug “planner” are already taken in the current namespace; changing the namespace via the Project URL selector or choosing a unique name/slug is required before submission can succeed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the namespace selector button with hasPopup menu ([284]) and choose a different namespace for the project.
- After selecting a different namespace, click “Create project” ([357]) to submit again. If errors persist, adjust the slug in [304] to a unique value while keeping the name “planner” if possible.

The user wants a new private project named “planner” and to add Abishek and Vinta as members. I’m on the “Create blank project” form with Project name and slug both set to “planner”, and the visibility already set to Private. When I submitted, the page returned validation errors: “Project namespace name has already been taken”, “Name has already been taken”, and “Path has already been taken.” This implies there’s a conflict in the current namespace, likely because a project named “planner” already exists here. To proceed while keeping the name “planner,” the best next step is to open the Project URL namespace selector (the button with a popup menu) to choose a different namespace (or verify/change the current one). After selecting an appropriate namespace, I can try submitting again; if name conflicts persist, I’ll adjust the slug to be unique while preserving the display name.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to “Create blank project” form.
- Entered “planner” as Project name and Project slug ([274], [304]).
- Set visibility to Private (radio [320] checked).
- Selected namespace “byteblaze” in the Project URL selector (button [284] now shows “byteblaze”).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to creating the project and then adding members.
- The form currently shows previous validation errors ([239]/[240], [243]-[245]): “Project namespace name has already been taken”, “Name has already been taken”, “Path has already been taken.”
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Textbox “Project name” ([274]) — value='planner', required, visible.
  - Textbox “Project slug” ([304]) — value='planner', required, visible.
  - Namespace selector button ([284]) — label 'byteblaze', hasPopup='menu', currently not expanded.
  - Radio “Private” ([320]) — checked=true.
  - Button “Create project” ([358]) — visible.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click “Create project” button ([358]) to submit with the “byteblaze” namespace.
- If errors persist, change the Project slug to a unique value (e.g., type 'planner-1' into textbox [304]) and click “Create project” ([358]) again.

The goal is to create a new private project named "planner" and then add Abishek and Vinta. I'm on the "Create blank project" form with the Project name and slug both set to "planner" and the visibility already set to Private. I previously switched the Project URL namespace to "byteblaze". The error messages shown are from a prior submission and will persist until I resubmit with the new namespace. The best next step is to click the "Create project" button to attempt creation under the "byteblaze" namespace. If creation still fails due to name/slug conflicts, I will adjust the slug to a unique value or select another namespace, but first I should try submitting now.

The goal is to add members Abishek and Vinta to the newly created private project "planner." I’m currently on the project’s Activity page. According to the tips, to add new members I should navigate to Project information > Members. In the left sidebar, I see a "Project information" link labeled [271]. The previous attempt clicked [283], which doesn’t exist on this page. The correct next step is to click "Project information" [271] to reach the section where the Members tab and the "Invite members" button should be available.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened the “Invite members” dialog on the project’s Members page.
- Selected “Abishek” from suggestions in the “Username or email address” field (chip visible in the dialog).
- No invitations sent yet; “Vinta” has not been added.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Current page: “Members · webagent / planner · GitLab” (breadcrumbs show webagent > planner > Members). This appears to be an existing project, not necessarily the newly created private “planner” under the intended namespace.
- The page is suitable for adding members, but it may be the wrong project relative to the goal (“new private project ‘planner’”).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Button “Invite members” ([604]) — dialog is open.
  - In-dialog:
    - Textbox “Username or email address” (id [917]) — populated with Abishek; a selected chip is shown.
    - Role selector (visible text “Guest”) — visible; default “Guest”.
    - Button “Invite” — visible and enabled.
    - Button “Cancel” — visible.
  - Other page controls:
    - Textbox “Filter members” ([639]) — empty; enabled.
    - Button “Search” (members table filter) ([641]) — enabled.
    - Top navigation “Dashboard” link ([71]) — visible.
    - Top navigation “Search” link ([153]) — visible.
- On-track for inviting members only if this is the correct project. Evidence (Members 3, existing accounts listed) suggests this is an existing project and not the newly created private one; action is likely off-target.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click “Dashboard” (link [71]) to return to your projects list and locate the newly created private project (correct namespace).
- Click “Search” (link [153]) and search for “webagent1/planner” (or the exact namespace/path used when creating the new project), then navigate to its Members page and proceed to invite Abishek and Vinta.

The task is to add both Abishek and Vinta as members to the "planner" project. The "Invite members" dialog is already open, and Abishek has been selected as a chip in the listbox (option showing “avatar Abishek S Close”), meaning Abishek is queued for invitation. To add multiple users, I need to search and select each one sequentially in the "Username or email address" textbox. The next step is to enter "Vinta" in the textbox to search for and then select Vinta from the suggestions, and afterward I will click Invite. Therefore, I will type "Vinta" into the username/email address field to bring up the suggestions for selection.

The task is to add both Abishek and Vinta as members to the "planner" project. The "Invite members" dialog is already open, and Abishek has been selected as a chip in the listbox (option showing “avatar Abishek S Close”), meaning Abishek is queued for invitation. To add multiple users, I need to search and select each one sequentially in the "Username or email address" textbox. The next step is to enter "Vinta" in the textbox to search for and then select Vinta from the suggestions, and afterward I will click Invite. Therefore, I will type "Vinta" into the username/email address field to bring up the suggestions for selection.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened the “Invite members” dialog on a project’s Members page.
- Selected “Abishek” from the suggestions in the “Username or email address” field (chip appears selected).
- Typed “Vinta” in the invite field; Vinta suggestion visible but not selected or invited.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Current page: “Members · webagent / planner · GitLab” (breadcrumbs show webagent > planner > Members). This is an existing project under the “webagent” namespace, not the newly created private project intended by the goal.
- The page allows inviting members, but actions here are off-target relative to the goal (should be the new private “planner” in the correct namespace).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Button “Invite members” ([604]) — dialog currently open.
  - Tab “Members 3” ([610]) — selected; shows existing members.
  - Top navigation links: “Dashboard” ([71]) and “Create new...” ([158]) — visible and enabled.
  - Filter textbox “Filter members” ([639]) — empty; enabled.
  - Button “Search” (members filter) ([641]) — enabled.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click “Dashboard” (link [71]) to leave the current project and return to the projects list.
- Click “Create new...” (link [158]) to start the correct new project creation flow, then proceed to set name “planner”, visibility “Private”, and after creation, navigate to that project’s Members page to invite Abishek and Vinta.

✅ Current Progress:
- Invite members modal is open on the project’s Members page.
- “Abishek” and “Vinta” are selected in the “Username or email address” field (chips visible), but they have not been invited yet.
- Project creation step is not confirmed; the current page shows an existing project (“webagent / planner”), not necessarily a newly created private project.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Current page: “Members · webagent / planner · GitLab” (breadcrumbs: webagent > planner > Members). This appears to be an existing project (Members tab shows existing entries), which does not confirm the “new private project” requirement.
- Acting here would add members to the wrong project if the goal is specifically the newly created private “planner”.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Button “Invite members” ([604]) — modal open.
  - In the modal: “Username or email address” input — contains selected chips “Abishek” and “Vinta”; “Select a role” dropdown — currently set to “Guest”; “Invite” button — visible and enabled; “Cancel” button — visible and enabled.
  - Top navigation: link “Dashboard” ([71]) — visible and enabled; link “Create new...” ([158]) — visible and enabled.
- Status: Off-track relative to the goal’s “new private project” requirement.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click “Cancel” in the invite modal to avoid adding members to the wrong project.
- Click “Create new...” (link [158]) to start the new project creation flow; set name to “planner”, visibility to Private, then navigate to that project’s Members page and invite Abishek and Vinta.

✅ Current Progress:

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Current page: Members · webagent / planner · GitLab. This is the Members page of an existing project (tab shows “Members 5”), not clearly the newly created private project requested.

- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Button “Invite members” ([610]) — visible and enabled.
  - Button “Dismiss” ([597]) — visible.
  - Sidebar link “Settings” ([513]) — visible and enabled (needed to verify/change visibility to Private).
  - Sidebar link “Project information” ([280]) — visible.
  - Top bar link “Create new...” ([158]) — visible and enabled (to start new project creation if needed).
  - Members table rows show Abishek S and Vinta Chen as direct members added just now; “Remove member” action visible for each.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click “Settings” (link [513]) to verify the project’s visibility and set it to Private if it is not.
- If this is not the newly created project, click “Create new...” (link [158]) to create a new project named “planner” with visibility set to Private, then add Abishek and Vinta on that project’s Members page.
