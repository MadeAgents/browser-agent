The user wants to know who else has access to their repository "gimmiethat.space" and to show their usernames. To find this, I should navigate to the specific project page and then open its Members section (Project information > Members). From the current Projects dashboard, the fastest way to locate the repo is to use the "Filter by name" searchbox (element [273]) rather than scrolling through many projects. I will first type "gimmiethat.space" into the filter box to narrow down the list to that project, then in subsequent steps I can click into the project and go to the Members tab.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the GitLab project page for “gimmiethat.space.”

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to the goal. To see who has access, the Members page needs to be opened from the project’s navigation.
- Relevant navigation elements (visible/clickable):
  - Link “Project information” [282] in “Project navigation” [273] (enabled). This typically contains the “Members” section.
  - Link “Settings” [515] (enabled). Depending on configuration, member access can sometimes be found here as well.
- Other elements present but not directly relevant to access listing:
  - Alert about SSH keys [575]/[579] (dismissible; unrelated to member access).
  - Repository/Commits/CI/CD links [301], [367], etc. (not needed for viewing members).

The goal is to find who else has access to the repository "gimmiethat.space" and list their usernames. On the current project page, the left sidebar shows a "Project information" section, which according to the provided tips contains the "Members" tab used to view and manage access. To reach the members list, the next logical step is to click "Project information." From there, I can navigate to the "Members" page to see all users with access and later exclude the user's own username (byteblaze) from the list. The accessibility tree confirms the presence of the clickable link [282] labeled "Project information" within the "Project navigation" section. Clicking it should either navigate to the Project information area or expand the submenu to reveal a "Members" link.
