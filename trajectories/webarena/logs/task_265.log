The user asks for the closest national park to Boston and the driving distance. On the OpenStreetMap page, there's a visible link labeled "Find directions between two points" (bid 167). The best workflow is to use the directions tool: set origin as "Boston" and destination as the nearest national park. Based on general knowledge, Acadia National Park is likely the nearest designated "National Park" to Boston (other nearby NPS units like Cape Cod National Seashore aren’t designated “National Park”). To be precise within this UI, I should open the directions panel first, then enter Boston and Acadia National Park, and let the map calculate the route distance. So the next step is to click the "Find directions between two points" link to open the routing interface.

The user asks for the closest national park to Boston and the driving distance. On the OpenStreetMap directions UI, the “From” field is already set to “Boston, MA” [194], and the travel mode is “Car” [173] with OSRM routing [182]. To compute the driving distance, I need to enter the destination as the nearest designated U.S. National Park.

The “To” textbox [199] is empty and ready for input. The best next step is to fill the destination with “Acadia National Park, ME” so the routing engine can calculate the distance.
