The user wants the customer with the most cancellations in the store’s history, including their email, name, and phone number. Based on the provided tips, the appropriate place to obtain counts by customer filtered by order status is in the Reports section, specifically the Customers reports such as "Order Count" or similar, where we can filter by Order Status = Canceled (Tip 5 mentions the 1-of-n selection UI for statuses). Also, Tip 8 suggests selecting the full history date range from Jan 1, 2022 to Today.

First step is to go to REPORTS from the Dashboard. On the current page, the REPORTS menu item is visible as a top navigation link with id [339]. I should click REPORTS to access reporting options. I will then look for Customers > Order Count, set date range to 01/01/2022 to Today, select Order Status as Specified -> Canceled, show the report, sort by Orders descending to find the max, click into the customer if needed to get email and phone number (or fetch from the report if available). But the immediate next action is to click the REPORTS menu.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the Reports menu from the Magento Admin dashboard; the Reports flyout overlay is visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to the goal. The Reports flyout shows the “Customers” section, which is relevant for identifying customers by order counts and filtering by status.
- Relevant elements (visible/enabled links):
  - Customers > Order Count (link with marker [417]) — key entry to view counts per customer (can later filter by status “Canceled” and full date range).
  - Customers > Order Total (link [414]) — related but less directly relevant to cancellations.
  - Customers > New (link [420]) — not relevant to cancellations.
- Other sections present (Sales, Marketing, Products, Business Intelligence), but the key path for cancellations per customer is via Customers > Order Count.

The user needs the email address, name, and phone number of the customer with the most cancellations in the store’s history. The best path is to use the Reports section to aggregate by customer and filter by canceled status. The Reports menu is already open as a flyout overlay on the Dashboard, showing a “Customers” section that includes “Order Count.” According to the tips, Reports > Customers > Order Count is the right place to get historical order statistics, and we can set the date range from 01/01/2022 to Today for full history (Tip 8) and filter by Order Status using the 1-of-n select UI (Tip 5), selecting “Canceled.” After generating the report, I can identify the customer with the highest order count (cancellations) and then obtain their contact details. If the report doesn’t show phone number, I can use the customer’s name or email to navigate to the Customers grid to get the phone number.

However, the current view shows no results, likely due to the date range not being set.

The user wants the customer with the most cancellations across the store’s entire history, including their email, name, and phone number. We’re currently on Reports > Customers > Order Count.

Goal: Identify the customer with the most cancellations in store history and provide their email, name, and phone number.

Current page: Reports > Customers > Order Count, with full-history dates set and data loaded. However, this report does not expose an Order Status filter, so it won’t let me isolate canceled orders, which is essential to determine cancellations per customer.

Plan:

- From there, I can filter to Canceled orders for the full historical range.
- Ideally, I need a report grouped by customer; if “Orders” report doesn’t group by customer, I’ll look for a Customers report (Order Count/Order Totals) that includes Order Status filtering. First step is to open the Reports menu to switch reports.

- Set date range From 01/01/2022 [731] to 12/18/2025 [738] and clicked Refresh [749].
- Reopened the Reports menu [339] to choose a more suitable report.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page shows the Reports navigation, which is on the critical path toward finding cancellations by customer.
- The Order Count report lacks an Order Status filter, so it cannot isolate “Canceled” orders.
- Relevant interactive elements to proceed:
  - Sales > Orders link [383], visible/enabled.
  - Customers > Order Count link [417], visible/enabled (already used but insufficient).
  - Date range fields [731] and [738] and Refresh button [749] on the current report page, visible/enabled but not useful for filtering by status.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the Sales > Orders link [383] to access the Orders report/grid where canceled orders can be reviewed and filtered, enabling identification of the customer with the most cancellations.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Reports > Sales > Orders page from the Magento Admin Reports section.
- Previously attempted Customers > Order Count with a full date range, but it lacked a way to isolate canceled orders.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This Orders Report page is not suitable for identifying cancellations by customer. The filter note states “Applies to Any of the Specified Order Statuses except canceled orders,” indicating canceled orders are excluded from this report—off the critical path for the goal.
- Relevant interactive elements on the current page:
  - Date Used combobox [753]: value “Order Created”, enabled.
  - Period combobox [761]: value “Day”, enabled.
  - From textbox [769]: required, currently empty.
  - To textbox [776]: required, currently empty.
  - Order Status combobox [783]: value “Any”, enabled (but canceled orders are excluded per the page note).
  - Show Report button [726]: visible/enabled.
  - Scope selector button “All Websites” [709]: visible/enabled.
- Because canceled orders are excluded here and the report aggregates by date (not by customer), continuing on this page will not yield the customer with the most cancellations.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the top navigation link “SALES” [157] to open the Sales menu and proceed to the Sales > Orders grid, where you can filter Status = “Canceled” and then identify the customer with the highest number of canceled orders.

Objective: Find the customer with the most canceled orders across the store’s entire history and provide their email, name, and phone number.

Current page: Reports > Sales > Orders Report. It explicitly excludes canceled orders (“Applies to Any of the Specified Order Statuses except canceled orders”), so this report is not suitable for cancellations. I need a report or grid that can filter by Order Status = Canceled and ideally aggregate by customer.

Plan:
1) Open the Reports menu to look for a Customers report (e.g., Customers > Order Count or Customers > Orders Total) that might allow filtering by Order Status (ideally selecting “Canceled”). If available, set date range from 01/01/2022 to Today, choose the status, run the report, and find the highest count per customer.
2) If no such report supports status filtering, I will pivot to the Sales > Orders grid (not Reports), filter Status = Canceled, and then identify the customer with the highest frequency. After identifying the customer, I will navigate to their Customer record to get email and phone.

Immediate next step: Open the REPORTS menu so I can access Customers-related reports that might support status selection or otherwise provide a customer-level aggregation.

  - Name: Samantha Jones
  - Email: coolcat321@hotmail.com
  - Phone: 3055551212

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is the order view for Order #000000088 (Status: Canceled) and is relevant but not sufficient to confirm “customer with the most cancellations.”
- Key on-page elements (all visible/enabled):
  - Button “Back” [741] — returns to the orders grid where counts across canceled orders can be verified.
  - Link “Samantha Jones” [790] — opens the customer profile.
  - Link “Edit Customer” [783] — navigates to customer edit/details.
  - Account Information table shows:

    - Email: “coolcat321@hotmail.com” [795]
  - Address Information shows phone “T: 3055551212” within the Billing/Shipping address groups.
- To achieve the goal, the agent must confirm which customer has the highest number of canceled orders across the full dataset; the current single-order view does not provide comparative counts.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button “Back” [741] to return to the Canceled Orders grid and verify which customer has the highest count of canceled orders (e.g., by tallying occurrences or exporting the grid, then aggregating by customer).
- If Samantha Jones is confirmed as the top customer, you can use the details on this page or click the “Samantha Jones” link [790] to open the customer record for further confirmation.

Goal: Provide the email address, name, and phone number of the customer with the most cancellations in the store’s history.

Context and approach:
- I navigated to Sales > Orders and filtered by Status = Canceled to identify the customer with the most canceled orders.
- From that grid, Samantha Jones appeared repeatedly among canceled orders, suggesting she has the highest number of cancellations.
- I opened a representative canceled order (#000000088) for Samantha Jones to retrieve definitive contact details.
- On the order view page, the Account Information and Address Information sections list the customer’s name, email, and phone number.

Data extracted from Order #000000088 (status: Canceled):
- Customer Name: “Samantha Jones” (linked in Account Information)
- Email: “coolcat321@hotmail.com”
- Phone: “T: 3055551212” (shown in Billing/Shipping Address)

Given the canceled orders grid indicated Samantha Jones appears most frequently and I have verified her contact details from the order page, I will provide the requested information succinctly.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Sales > Orders, filtered to Status: “Canceled,” and opened Order #000000088.
- Extracted candidate customer details from the order page:
  - Name: Samantha Jones
  - Email: coolcat321@hotmail.com
  - Phone: 3055551212
- A definitive confirmation of “most cancellations” across all customers has not been performed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (Order #000000088) is relevant but insufficient to determine the customer with the most cancellations overall; it shows only one canceled order’s details.
- Relevant interactive elements visible and enabled:
  - Button “Back” [741] — returns to the Orders grid to review all canceled orders.
  - Link “Samantha Jones” [790] — opens the customer profile.
  - Link “Edit Customer” [783] — navigates to customer edit/details.
- Non-interactive but pertinent fields:
  - Order Status: “Canceled” [769].
  - Account Information shows Email “coolcat321@hotmail.com” [795].
  - Address Information shows phone “T: 3055551212” (within Billing/Shipping address groups).
- To achieve the goal, the agent must verify which customer has the highest count of canceled orders across the full dataset; the current single-order view does not provide comparative counts.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button with id [741] labeled “Back” to return to the Canceled Orders grid and tally cancellations per customer (e.g., scan counts or export the grid), then confirm the top customer before finalizing the answer.
