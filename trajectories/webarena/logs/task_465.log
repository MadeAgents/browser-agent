The user wants a specific product added to their wish list. The fastest way to find a specific product on this site is to use the search bar rather than navigating categories. On the current page, I see a search combobox labeled "Search" with bid 272. The search button is currently disabled, which usually becomes enabled after entering text. My next step is to fill the search input with the exact product name so I can then proceed to execute the search and find the product page where I can add it to the wish list.

The goal is to add a specific product to the wish list. I already entered the exact product name into the search field (combobox 272), and the accessibility tree shows it is focused and has the correct value. The logical next step is to execute the search to find the product. There is a “Search” button adjacent to the input with bid 277. Clicking this should navigate to the results page where I can locate the exact item and then add it to the wish list. I will click the Search button now.

The user's goal is to add the specific product "Tide PODS Spring Meadow Scent HE Turbo Laundry Detergent Pacs, 81 Count" to their wish list. I am on the search results page where the first product tile matches this exact name. Within that tile, there is a clearly labeled "Add to Wish List" button (bid 1425).
