- link 'Invoices' [171] — visible; not directly needed for updating tracking.
- link 'Shipments' [174] — visible; may be used after opening the specific order to manage shipment tracking.
Other elements on the dashboard (e.g., button 'Reload Data' [714], tabbed reports) are unrelated to the task. Proceeding via Orders [168] is the appropriate next step to find and update order #306 with the UPS tracking number.

The combobox [1039] controls those options; ensuring it is active/expanded will make the options visible again. The most reliable next step is to re-click the combobox [1039] to open or re-open the options list so I can select “United Parcel Service” in the following step and then fill the tracking number.

The objective is to add a UPS tracking number to order #306 on the New Shipment page. I already added a tracking row and opened the carrier combobox [1039]. Previously, clicking the “United Parcel Service” option [1043] failed due to a visibility/scroll issue. To reliably set the carrier to UPS without relying on option visibility, I will use the select_option action on the carrier combobox [1039] to select “United Parcel Service.” After the carrier is correctly set, I will fill the tracking number field [1048] with 55591023930 in the next step and then submit the shipment.

The goal is to add the UPS tracking number 55591023930 to order #306. I’m on the New Shipment page for Order #000000306, and the tracking section shows a row with columns for Carrier, Title, Number, and Action. I previously added a tracking row and set the Carrier combobox [1039] to “United Parcel Service.” The Title field [1046] is auto-filled with "United Parcel Service," and the Number field [1048] is currently empty. To proceed, I should enter the tracking number into the Number textbox [1048]. After this, I will need to submit the shipment using the “Submit Shipment” button [927] to save the tracking to the order, but for now the immediate next step is to fill the tracking number field.

The user wants to update order #306 with the UPS tracking number 55591023930. I’m on the “New Shipment” page for Order #000000306. In the “Shipping Information” > tracking section, I already added a tracking row and set:
