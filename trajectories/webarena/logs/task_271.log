The user wants to see products under $46.99 in the "makeup remover" category. The homepage shows a top navigation with categories, including "Beauty & Personal Care," which likely contains "makeup remover." Per the tips, for browsing tasks, I should navigate using dropdown menus rather than search. So the next step is to hover over "Beauty & Personal Care" to reveal its subcategories, then find and click "makeup remover." After that, I can apply a price filter under $46.99. For now, I will hover on the "Beauty & Personal Care" menu item (bid 288) to expose the submenu.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the “Beauty & Personal Care” top navigation menu by hovering, revealing its subcategories.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the correct path toward the goal. The expanded “Beauty & Personal Care” menu shows relevant subcategories that likely contain “makeup remover.”
- Menuitem “Makeup” (id: 357): hasPopup=menu, visible/enabled; likely leads to deeper makeup subcategories.
- Menuitem “Skin Care” (id: 331): hasPopup=menu, visible/enabled; may also contain “makeup remover.”
- Other nav items (e.g., “Oral Care” id: 293) are visible but not relevant.
- Search bar combobox (id: 273) is available; “Search” button (id: 278) is currently disabled until input is provided.

The next critical step is to navigate into the “Makeup” (or “Skin Care”) submenu to find the “Makeup Remover” category, then apply price filtering under $46.99 on that category page.

The goal is to show products under $46.99 in the "makeup remover" category. Per the tips, I should use the top navigation dropdowns rather than search. I previously hovered the "Beauty & Personal Care" menu (bid 288), which revealed subcategories including "Skin Care" and "Makeup". To find "Makeup Remover", it's likely nested under "Makeup". The next logical step is to hover over "Makeup" (bid 357) to expand its submenu and look for a "Makeup Remover" subcategory to click into. Once on that category page, I can apply a price filter under $46.99. So I will hover "Makeup" to reveal its nested items.

- No errors or off-path indicators detected; next step is to apply a price constraint using the Price filter in the sidebar to limit results to under $46.99.

The user wants to see products under $46.99 in the Makeup Remover category. We’re already on the category page (“Makeup Remover Items 1-12 of 109”). To narrow results by price, the left sidebar has “Shop By” → “Price” options. The only available price ranges are:
- $0.00 - $99.99 (107 items)
- $100.00 and above (2 items)

While there isn’t an exact “under $46.99” bracket, the closest available filter that excludes the higher-priced items is $0.00 - $99.99. Applying this filter will at least constrain results to lower-priced products and move toward the user’s goal. After applying it, I can then consider further steps (like sorting by price ascending) if needed. For now, the best next action is to click the “$0.00 - $99.99” link (bid 1840) under the Price filter.
