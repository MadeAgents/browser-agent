The user wants me to create a new milestone within the current GitLab project. On GitLab, milestones are managed under the project's Issues area. From the current page (Primer / design project), the left sidebar shows an "Issues" link (bid 330). The typical workflow is: click Issues, then navigate to the Milestones tab and use "New milestone" to create one with the specified dates. Since I need to progress step-by-step and only one action is allowed, the next best action is to click the Issues link to access the Issues section where I can find the Milestones tab.

The user wants a new milestone created for "cleaning sensitive information" with a start date of 2/16/2023 and an end date 20 days later (which will be March 8, 2023). To create a milestone in GitLab, I need to navigate to the Milestones section of the current project (Primer / design). On the current Issues page, the left sidebar under Project navigation shows the "Milestones" link with bid 348. Clicking this will bring me to the Milestones page where I can then use "New milestone" to set the title, description, start date, and due date. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next action is to click the "Milestones" link.

The user requested creating a milestone starting on 2/16/2023 and ending 20 days later. I’m currently on the Milestones page for the project (Primer / design). Reviewing the list on this page, I see an existing milestone titled "Cleaning sensitive information" with the exact date range "Feb 16, 2023–Mar 8, 2023," which corresponds to the requested start date and 20-day duration. Creating another one would cause duplication. The best next step is to inform the user that the milestone already exists and confirm whether they want any changes (e.g., description) or if I should leave it as is.
