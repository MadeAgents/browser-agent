There's also a "Manage Addresses" link [1386], which typically opens the Address Book page allowing editing both default billing and shipping addresses in one place, and setting defaults. To efficiently update both addresses and ensure consistency, the best next step is to click "Manage Addresses". From there, I can fill in street, suite, city, state (Illinois), zip (60601), and keep the phone number since the user didn’t specify changes.

The user wants their address updated to "231 Willow Way, Suite 100, Chicago, IL, 60601." On the Edit Address form, I’ve already set Street Address Line 1 to "231 Willow Way," Line 2 to "Suite 100," State/Province to "Illinois," and City to "Chicago." The remaining field that needs updating is the Zip/Postal Code, which still shows "94010." The correct next step is to change the Zip/Postal Code textbox [1744] to "60601," and then I will proceed to save the address in the following step.

The user's goal is to update their address to "231 Willow Way, Suite 100, Chicago, IL, 60601" on OneStopShopping. I am on the Edit Address form and have already updated the relevant fields: Street Address Line 1 to "231 Willow Way," Street Address Line 2 to "Suite 100," State/Province to "Illinois," City to "Chicago," and Zip/Postal Code to "60601." The Country is "United States," and other fields like name and phone number are unchanged, as the user didn't request changes. The form indicates this is the default billing and shipping address, so saving should apply to both. The next step is to commit these changes by clicking the "Save Address" button [1754].
