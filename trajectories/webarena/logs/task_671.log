The task requires collecting review titles with ratings of 2 stars or less for "Sony Computer Entertainment VR" from the OneStopShop site, then posting them on the games forum. I'm currently on the One Stop Market homepage. To efficiently find the specific product page with reviews, I should use the site’s search bar rather than navigating categories. The accessibility tree shows a search combobox at [372] labeled "Search". The search button is disabled until text is entered. Therefore, the next best action is to fill the search input with "Sony Computer Entertainment VR" to bring up the product search results. After that, I can submit the search and navigate to the product page to access its reviews.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the “Customer Reviews” section on the product page for “Sony Computer Entertainment VR - Worlds Bundle - PlayStation 4.” Review titles are visible; extraction of ≤2-star titles and subreddit posting have not yet been performed.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to gathering the required review titles.
- Relevant elements for progressing:
  - [1523] link “12 Reviews” — already used to access reviews; visible and clickable.
  - Customer Reviews list — visible; each review shows a star rating and a title (e.g., “As described worth the money,” “Welcome to a new way of gaming,” “Works great the kids love it,” “Disappointing! Didn’t last long…,” “Didn’t last a year without issues,” “Received used items!”). These items are static text; not interactive.
  - Pagination controls (visible at the bottom in the screenshot: “1” and “2”) — likely clickable to view additional reviews; needed to ensure all ≤2-star reviews are checked.
  - [1526] “Add Your Review” — visible/clickable; not needed for collection.
  - Other product-page controls (Qty [1546], “Add to Cart” [1548]) — visible/clickable; not relevant to the goal.
- No off-track indicators detected. The task now requires identifying which visible review titles correspond to ratings of 2 stars or less (by visually confirming star counts) and then proceeding to collect titles from all pages of reviews.

The task is two-part: 1) gather the titles of reviews rated 2 stars or less for the Sony Computer Entertainment VR product on OneStopShop, and 2) post those titles to the games subreddit with the specified title. I'm currently on the product page with the Reviews tab open and can see several reviews, including ratings expressed as percentages: 100% (5 stars), 40% (2 stars), and 20% (1 star). Reviews that meet the <=2-star criterion correspond to 40% (2 stars) and 20% (1 star).

From Page 1, I can already identify three titles that satisfy the criterion:
- "Disappointing. Didn't last long before it stopped powering on and needed to be sent in for repair." (40%)
- "didn't last a year without issues" (40%)
- "Received used items!!" (20%)

Total reviews are 12, and pagination shows “Page 2” [2163]. To ensure I collect all matching titles, I need to navigate to Page 2 and inspect additional reviews for <=2-star ratings. The most efficient next step is to click the "Page 2" link to load the remaining reviews.

✅ Current Progress: 
- Opened the product’s Customer Reviews and navigated both pages (Page 1 and Page 2).
- Identified all review titles with ratings ≤2 stars:
  - “Disappointing. Didn't last long before it stopped powering on and needed to be sent in for repair.” — 40% (2 stars)
  - “didn't last a year without issues” — 40% (2 stars)
  - “Received used items!!” — 20% (1 star)
- Titles have been gathered but not yet posted to the games subreddit.

🔍 Current State Analysis: 
- The current page “Sony Computer Entertainment VR - Worlds Bundle - PlayStation 4” on OneStopShop is on the critical path for collecting review titles; the collection step appears complete.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - [1523] link “12 Reviews” — visible/clickable; used to access reviews.
  - Pagination: “Page 1” [2258] (visible/clickable) and “Page 2” [2521] (currently selected/visible) — used to view all reviews.
  - Customer review entries — visible static text blocks showing titles and rating percentages (used to identify ≤2‑star titles).
  - [1526] link “Add Your Review” and review form fields — visible; not required for this goal.
- To proceed with the overall goal, the next phase requires navigating to Reddit (games subreddit) to create a post with the collected titles. No errors or off-track behavior detected on the current page.

The user wants me to collect all review titles rated 2 stars or less for the Sony Computer Entertainment VR product on OneStopShop and then post them on the games subreddit. I’m currently on the product page with the Reviews tab open, and the pagination indicates that I am on “Page 2.” On Page 2, I can see one qualifying review title “Received used items!!” (20% = 1 star).

The user’s goal is twofold: first, gather the titles of reviews rated 2 stars or less for the Sony Computer Entertainment VR product from OneStopShop; second, post those titles to the games subreddit (forum) under the exact title "real user feedback on Sony Computer Entertainment VR". I have already reviewed the product page’s reviews and identified the qualifying titles:
- "Disappointing. Didn't last long before it stopped powering on and needed to be sent in for repair." (40% = 2 stars)
- "didn't last a year without issues" (40% = 2 stars)
- "Received used items!!" (20% = 1 star)

With data gathering complete, I need to navigate to the forum site to create the post. The Task Tips specify using the Community Forum at http://10.177.37.113:9999/forums/all and that when creating a post, the URL field should be left empty and all content should go in the Body field, ensuring exact title formatting. Therefore, the next step is to go to the forum’s “all” page to locate the games forum and submit the post with the specified title and the collected review titles in the body.

The user’s goal is to post the collected review titles (≤2-star) from OneStopShop into the gaming forum under the exact title provided. I’m on the “Create submission” page for the gaming forum. The Title field [138] is already correctly filled with “real user feedback on Sony Computer Entertainment VR”. To complete the post, I need to place the gathered review titles into the Body field [143]. Based on prior navigation and extraction, the qualifying titles are:
- "Disappointing. Didn't last long before it stopped powering on and needed to be sent in for repair."
- "didn't last a year without issues"
- "Received used items!!"
Per the forum posting tips, the URL field should remain empty, and all content should be placed in the Body. The next single action should be to fill the Body textbox with these titles, formatted clearly (e.g., each on a new line or as bullet points). After this, I can submit in a subsequent step.

The task requires me to submit the post in the “gaming” forum with the title “real user feedback on Sony Computer Entertainment VR” and with the collected review titles in the Body. I have already filled the Title field correctly and populated the Body with the three qualifying review titles gathered from OneStopShop. The URL field is intentionally left empty per the guidelines. The form appears ready for submission, as the preview shows the bullet points correctly and the Title is marked as required and filled. The next logical step is to click the “Create submission” button to finalize and post the submission.
