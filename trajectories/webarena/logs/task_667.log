The user wants me to submit a merge request from the dialog-component branch into the bump-doctocat branch and assign primer as the reviewer. I'm currently on the project page for Primer / design, and I need to navigate to the merge requests section where I can create a new MR. According to the page's accessibility tree, there's a "Merge requests" link within the project navigation sidebar with bid 354. Clicking that should take me to the project's merge requests overview, where I can then select "New merge request" and proceed to set source and target branches and assign a reviewer. Since I can only perform one action at a time, the best next step is to click the "Merge requests" link to get to the correct section for creating the MR.

- Sorting controls (e.g., button “Created date” [830]); not required for the goal.

No deviation detected. The next step to achieve the goal will be available via the “New merge request” link to select source branch “dialog-component”, target branch “bump-doctocat”, and assign reviewer “primer.”

The user’s goal is to submit a merge request from the dialog-component branch to the bump-doctocat branch and assign primer as the reviewer.

The main content area shows a visible “New merge request” link/button with bid 578. To initiate the MR creation workflow where I can choose the source and target branches and set the reviewer, the next logical step is to click “New merge request.” This aligns with the site tips for creating new MRs and is necessary before I can configure branches and reviewers.

The goal is to submit the merge request and assign "primer" as the reviewer. I'm already on the "New merge request" page with the correct branches set (From dialog-component into bump-doctocat). The title and description are populated. To assign a reviewer, I need to open the Reviewer selection UI. The accessibility tree shows the "Reviewer" section with a button labeled "Unassigned" (bid 706). Clicking this should open a dropdown or modal where I can select or search for "primer". After that, I can proceed to submit the MR. Since only a single action is allowed per step, the best next action is to click the "Unassigned" button under Reviewer to open the reviewer selection.
