The user wants to know if Duquesne University in Pittsburgh can be reached in one hour by car from Pittsburgh International Airport. On OpenStreetMap, the best way is to use the directions feature. The current page shows the OpenStreetMap homepage with a search box and a link labeled "Find directions between two points" (bid 167) which aligns with the “two arrow” button mentioned in the task tips. The first step should be to open the directions panel so I can input the start and end locations. I will click the "Find directions between two points" link to bring up the routing interface.

The user’s goal is to check if Duquesne University in Pittsburgh can be reached within one hour by car from Pittsburgh International Airport. We’re on the OpenStreetMap Directions page, and the “From” textbox contains Pittsburgh International Airport, and the “To” textbox contains Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, PA. The mode is set to Car, and the routing engine is OSRM. I previously pressed Enter on the “To” field, and the live region shows “Loading…”, meaning the route calculation was triggered but results have not yet populated.

To move forward and get the travel time, I should try an action that helps produce the route summary with duration if the current loading is stuck or delayed. A reliable approach is to switch the routing engine, which forces a recalculation and often surfaces the results. The combobox for “Directions services” [182] lists options: GraphHopper, OSRM, Valhalla. I will switch to GraphHopper, which should immediately recompute and display the time/distance. This is a single, effective action that can lead to the visible duration we need to answer the “within one hour” question.

I will use select_option on the combobox (bid 182) to choose GraphHopper.

The goal is to determine whether driving from Pittsburgh International Airport to Duquesne University can be done within one hour. We’re already on the OpenStreetMap directions page with the correct origin and destination entered, “Car” mode selected, and the routing engine currently set to OSRM. However, the page shows an error: “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” This is likely due to the chosen routing engine failing for this request. To proceed, a common and effective step is to switch to another routing service to force a recalculation that may succeed and provide the travel time. The combobox for “Directions services” (bid 182) offers GraphHopper and Valhalla in addition to OSRM. We already tried switching engines previously and came back to OSRM; the next best attempt is to switch to Valhalla to try a fresh calculation. Once selected, the site typically auto-recomputes; if not, we can press Enter in the “To” field afterward. For now, I will switch the service to Valhalla.

The user wants to know whether Duquesne University in Pittsburgh can be reached within one hour by car from Pittsburgh International Airport using the OpenStreetMap directions tool. The current page shows the OSM Directions panel already populated:
- From: Pittsburgh International Airport, … 15231, United States
- To: Duquesne University, … 15282, United States
- Mode: Car

However, the page displays “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” We already tried:
- Pressing Enter in the “To” field.
- Switching between GraphHopper, OSRM, and Valhalla.
- Pressing Enter again after switching engines.

The error persists. A common trick to force the router to recompute is toggling “Reverse Directions,” which recalculates the route in the opposite direction and often breaks through transient failures. If it returns a duration (even reversed), that duration is typically similar and sufficient to check the “within one hour” condition. Given we’ve already tried engine changes and Enter presses, the next best non-redundant action is to click the “Reverse Directions” button [200] to trigger a fresh calculation.
