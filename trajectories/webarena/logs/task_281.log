The user wants the complete product names of Oral B brush heads designed for children, with their price range per brush. I’m on the One Stop Market homepage with a top navigation that includes “Beauty & Personal Care,” which is likely to contain oral care items like brush heads. According to the tips, for browsing tasks I should navigate via dropdown menus using hover rather than the search bar. So the next best step is to hover over “Beauty & Personal Care” to reveal subcategories (e.g., Oral Care, Toothbrush Heads) and then proceed to the relevant section to locate Oral-B kids brush heads. I will hover the “Beauty & Personal Care” menu item to expose its submenu.

The user wants the complete product names of Oral-B brush heads designed for children, plus the price range per brush. I’m currently on one such product page: “Oral-B Kids Extra Soft Replacement Brush Heads featuring STAR WARS, 2 count,” priced at $12.99. To establish the range, I need at least one more relevant kids brush head product and its pack count to compute price per brush. The search bar at the top (combobox [419]) is available; the Search button ([424]) is disabled until text is entered. From earlier context, another relevant item was “Kids By Oral-b Stages Power Star Wars Replacement Heads 4 Pack” priced at $14.98. The most efficient next step is to use the on-page search field to find that second product’s detail page, ensuring I capture the exact full name and price to compute per-brush values accurately.

The user wants the complete product names of Oral-B brush heads designed for children and their price per brush range. I’m on a search results page already showing relevant items. To ensure I capture the exact full product name and confirm pack size for accurate per-brush calculations, I should open the product detail page.

The previous attempt at clicking the search button timed out but is irrelevant; I shouldn't retry it. The best next step now is to click the product title link with bid 1522.

Objective: Provide complete product names of Oral‑B brush heads designed for children on the current site and give the corresponding price per brush and overall range.

Current page: Product detail page for “Kids By Oral-b Stages Power Star Wars Replacement Heads 4 Pack,” price $14.98. This is a kids Oral‑B brush head product and includes pack size (4). Per-brush price = 14.98 / 4 ≈ $3.75.

From earlier in-session navigation, another relevant product was identified on this same site: “Oral-B Kids Extra Soft Replacement Brush Heads featuring STAR WARS, 2 count,” priced at $12.99. Pack size is 2, so per-brush price = 12.99 / 2 ≈ $6.50.

These two items are clearly Oral‑B children’s brush heads with complete names and visible prices. Listing them with per-brush prices and then stating the overall per-brush price range addresses the user’s request. No further site navigation is strictly required to answer.

Plan: Send a concise message listing both complete product names, their totals and pack counts, computed per-brush prices, and the overall per-brush price range. Avoid any mention of non-relevant page content (e.g., blurred face).
