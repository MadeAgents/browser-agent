The user wants me to create a new GitLab group named "webagent" and add members pandey2000 and sayakpaul (noting sayakpaul is listed twice; I'll add them once since duplicates are typically not allowed). I'm on the GitLab dashboard Projects page. To create a new group, the usual path is through the top navigation "Create new..." which opens a dropdown with options like New project, New group, etc. The accessibility tree shows [141] link 'Create new...' in the header. The best next step is to click that to open the dropdown so I can select New group.

The user's goal is to add members to the newly created group "webagent." I'm currently on the group's Activity page. According to the tips and typical GitLab structure, member management is accessed via "Group information" and then the "Members" section. In the left sidebar, there's a visible "Group information" link (bid 264). Clicking that should navigate to the group overview where I can access "Members" and then invite users pandey2000 and sayakpaul. The last action shows an attempt to click a "Group information" element with a different bid (267), but the current accessibility tree confirms 264 is the correct target now.

Objective: Add members pandey2000 and sayakpaul to the newly created group "webagent". We’re currently on the group’s Activity page (URL shows /groups/webagent1/-/activity; name is webagent). To invite members, we need to navigate to the Group information area where the Members tab exists.

Analysis of current UI:
- Left sidebar includes "Group information" [264], which should navigate to the group overview where a "Members" tab/link is typically available.
- We previously attempted to click [264], but the page context still shows the Activity page; to progress, we need to ensure navigation to Group information occurs, which is the logical next step before locating and clicking "Members" and then "Invite members."

Plan:
1. Click "Group information" in the left sidebar to reach the group info page.
2. On the next page, locate and click "Members".
3. Use "Invite members" to add users pandey2000 and sayakpaul.

Next action: Click the "Group information" link [264].

The user's goal is to have the group "webagent" created and add members pandey2000 and sayakpaul (note: sayakpaul is listed twice, but duplicates are typically not allowed). The group has already been created, and the "Invite members" modal is open. The current state shows:

- The username field (bid 668) currently contains "sayakpaul" as text, and a suggestion dropdown is visible with a menu item "Sayak Paul — sayakpaul" (bid 942).

To properly add "sayakpaul" as a selected token, I should click the suggestion menu item. After that, I can click "Invite" to finalize, but since only one action is allowed per step, the immediate next best action is to click the suggestion "Sayak Paul — sayakpaul" to add them to the invite list.
