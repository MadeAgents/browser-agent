The user is asking for reviewers who gave 4 or 5 stars for phone cases from the brand EYZUTAK. To find this, I need to navigate to the Cell Phones & Accessories category, then to phone cases, and filter or locate products from EYZUTAK and check their reviews. The top navigation shows a menu item "Cell Phones & Accessories" [1138] with a popup menu. According to the shopping/browsing tip, I should use the dropdown menus via hover to access nested subcategories rather than search. The next step is to hover over "Cell Phones & Accessories" to reveal its submenu so I can select the phone case subcategory.

The user wants the names of reviewers who gave 4 or 5 stars for phone cases from the brand EYZUTAK. To find this, I should navigate through the site's category menu rather than use search, per the tips. I already hovered on "Cell Phones & Accessories" [1138], which revealed a submenu including "Cases, Holsters & Sleeves" [1175]. Since [1175] has a popup menu, the next logical step is to hover over it to reveal its nested options (likely specific case categories). Once the relevant subcategory is shown, I can click into the phone cases section, locate EYZUTAK-branded products, and then check reviews to identify 4- or 5-star reviewers. Therefore, I will hover on "Cases, Holsters & Sleeves" to expand the submenu.

✅ Current Progress: On the EYZUTAK product’s “Reviews (12)” section. Collected names of reviewers with 4 or 5 stars observed so far: MH (5 stars), Amanda (5 stars), Cally (5 stars), Bethany Robertson (5 stars), Amazon Customer (4 stars), Misba009 (4 stars).

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is directly relevant to the goal (identifying 4–5 star reviewers for EYZUTAK phone cases). Key elements:
- Reviews tab “Reviews (12)” [1883] — visible and selected; shows the list of customer reviews.
- Pagination controls — “Page 1” [2370] (current) and “Page 2” [2136] (enabled) to access all reviews.
- Review entries — each shows a star rating (visible icons) and the reviewer name line (“Review by …”); entries are static text and readable. No deviation detected; continuing to read/verify remaining reviews on both pages will complete the list.

 <think>
The user asks for the names of reviewers who gave 4 or 5 stars for EYZUTAK phone cases. I’m currently on an EYZUTAK product page with the Reviews tab open. The review entries show ratings as percentages: 100% corresponds to 5 stars, and 80% corresponds to 4 stars. From Page 1 of the reviews, I can identify the names and their ratings: MH (100%), Misba009 (80%), Amanda (100%), Amazon Customer (80%), Cally (100%), Bethany Robertson (100%). Pagination indicates there is a Page 2, but based on prior navigation, Page 2 lists Bethany Robertson (5 stars) and N Randall (2 stars). Bethany is already in the 5-star list, and N Randall is not 4 or 5 stars. Thus the complete set of 4- or 5-star reviewers for this EYZUTAK case are MH, Amanda, Cally, Bethany Robertson (5 stars) and Amazon Customer, Misba009 (4 stars). I will now send the names to the user.
