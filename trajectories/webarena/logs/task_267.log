The user's goal is to find the closest national park to Stephen King's hometown and the driving time to get there. On the OpenStreetMap page, the search box is focused, and there is a link labeled "Find directions between two points" (bid 167). To compute driving time, I should use the directions tool. I will first open the directions interface. After that, I can input Stephen King's hometown (I will use Portland, Maine, which is broadly recognized as his birthplace/hometown) and the destination (Acadia National Park, which is the only national park in Maine and the likely closest). The immediate next step is to click the "Find directions between two points" link to bring up the routing panel.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is OpenStreetMap with the routing panel visible, which is on the critical path for computing driving time. Relevant interactive elements:
- Radio “Car” [173]: checked=true, visible.
- Combobox “Directions services” [182]: value='OSRM', expanded=false, visible.
- Textbox “From” [194]: empty, editable, visible.
- Textbox “To” [199]: empty, editable, visible.
- Button “Reverse Directions” [200]: visible.
A prior click attempted on element id '167', which does not exist in the current axtree, indicating a misclick/off-target action.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click textbox labeled “From” [194] and type “Bangor, Maine”.
- Click textbox labeled “To” [199] and type “Acadia National Park”.

The user asks for the closest national park to Stephen King’s hometown and the driving time. Stephen King’s well-known hometown is Bangor, Maine. The closest U.S. national park to Bangor is Acadia National Park. To provide an accurate driving time, I should use the OpenStreetMap directions panel visible on the current page. The interface shows the “From” and “To” textboxes with Car routing selected and OSRM as the routing service. The correct approach is to enter “Bangor, Maine” in the From field and “Acadia National Park” in the To field, then trigger route calculation (typically by pressing Enter). I will start by filling the “From” textbox.
