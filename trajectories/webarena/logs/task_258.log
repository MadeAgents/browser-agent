 <think>
The user wants to see all public projects. On the current GitLab Projects dashboard, there are tabs: "Yours", "Starred", "Explore", and "Topics". In GitLab, the Explore section typically lists public projects across the instance. Therefore, to view public projects, I should click the "Explore" link. I see the "Explore" link in the main Projects page navigation with bid 264. Clicking it should navigate to the Explore page where public projects are shown. This aligns with the provided tips that the Explore tab allows browsing public repositories (All Explore, Most Stars, Trending). I will click the "Explore" tab.

✅ Current Progress: Clicked the “Explore” tab to view projects, moving toward the goal of seeing public projects.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the Projects section and appears on the critical path toward the goal. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link “Explore” [245]: Visible and clickable (used).
- Searchbox “Filter by name” [250]: Visible, editable, currently empty.
- Button “Most stars” [254]: Visible, enabled; controls sorting.
- Tabs/links “All” [288], “Most stars” [290], “Trending” [292]: Visible, enabled; control the listing category.
- Button “Visibility: Any” [296] (hasPopup=listbox): Visible, enabled; currently set to “Any”. This control is relevant for filtering by visibility and may include a “Public” option to show only public projects.

The page lists numerous projects and seems to be the Explore view; adjusting the “Visibility” control to “Public” (if available) would align precisely with seeing all public projects.
