✅ Current Progress:
- Performed search for “Sony Bluetooth headphones” and reached the results page.
- Extracted several Sony Bluetooth headphone product names and a preliminary price range from the first page of results.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is relevant to the goal. It shows “Search results for: 'Sony Bluetooth headphones'” with Items 1–12 of 5578, indicating many results.
- Key elements to refine and accurately determine the overall price range:
  - Sort control: combobox labeled “Sort By” (node [1389]), current value “Relevance”, options include “Price” (node [1391]) and “Product Name” (node [1390]); not expanded.
  - Sort direction toggle: link “Set Ascending Direction” (node [1393]); visible and enabled.
  - View toggle: link “View as List” (node [1381]); visible.
  - Search input: combobox “Search” with value “Sony Bluetooth headphones” (node [275]); Search button is disabled (node [280]), which is expected on the results page.
- Note: Results include non-headphone accessories; focusing on items whose titles indicate Sony Bluetooth headphones is necessary for accuracy.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- To compute an accurate price range across all available models, sort by price:
  1) Click the “Sort By” combobox (id/label: ‘Sort By’, node [1389]) and select option “Price” (node [1391]).
  2) Click the sort direction control “Set Ascending Direction” (node [1393]) to show the lowest-priced items first; record the first headphone’s price as the minimum. Then click the same sort-direction control again to switch to the opposite direction and record the first headphone’s price as the maximum.
- Optionally improve scanning of full names: Click “View as List” (node [1381]) to display product titles more clearly and avoid truncation when collecting complete names.
