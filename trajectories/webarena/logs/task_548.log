The user wants to add the color Blue to sizes S and M for the Frankie Sweatshirt configurable product. I am in the "Create Product Configurations" wizard at Step 2: Attribute Values. Here, I need to select the specific attribute values that will form the new variants. The Size section shows multiple sizes currently selected (XS, S, M, L, XL). The Color section shows Green, White, and Yellow selected, while Blue is currently unchecked. To create only S-Blue and M-Blue variants, I should first select Blue, and then later deselect the extra sizes (XS, L, XL) and colors (Green, White, Yellow).

The user wants to add the color Blue to sizes S and M for the Frankie Sweatshirt configurable product. I am in the "Create Product Configurations" wizard at Step 2: Attribute Values. Here, I need to select the specific attribute values that will form the new variants. The Size section shows multiple sizes currently selected (XS, S, M, L, XL). The Color section shows Green, White, and Yellow selected, while Blue is currently unchecked. To create only S-Blue and M-Blue variants, I should first select Blue, and then later deselect the extra sizes (XS, L, XL) and colors (Green, White, Yellow). Since only one action is allowed per step, the most logical immediate action is to select the Blue checkbox under Color.

The goal is to create configurations only for Color=Blue with Size=S and M. In Step 2: Attribute Values, S and M are already selected for Size, and the Color section currently has Blue, Green, White, and Yellow selected. If I proceed now, Magento would generate combinations for all selected colors, which would include non-Blue variants (not desired).

✅ Current Progress:

- The summary table lists the new products to be created (Size S + Blue and Size M + Blue).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Button “Generate Products” — visible and enabled in the modal; creates the listed configurations.
  - Button “Back” — visible; allows returning to adjust selections if needed.
  - Underlying product page button “Save” (id=900) — visible/enabled on the edit page after the modal completes; required to persist changes.
- No deviation detected; workflow aligns with the goal.

The goal is to add the Blue color to sizes S and M for the Frankie Sweatshirt configurable product. I am currently in the “Create Product Configurations” modal at Step 4: Summary. The summary table shows exactly two products to be created: MH04-S-Blue and MH04-M-Blue, confirming the selections are correct (Size S and M with Color Blue only). To actually create these variants, I need to click the “Generate Products” button in the modal. This should add the new configurations to the product. After generation, I will likely need to click “Save” on the main product page to persist changes, but for now the next best single action is to generate the products.

The user's goal is to add the color Blue to sizes S and M for the "Frankie Sweatshirt" configurable product. I opened the Edit Configurations wizard, selected Size=S and M, Color=Blue, and generated the products. The Current Variations grid now shows the two new variants:
- Frankie Sweatshirt-S-Blue (SKU MH04-S-Blue), Attributes: Size S, Color Blue
- Frankie Sweatshirt-M-Blue (SKU MH04-M-Blue), Attributes: Size M, Color Blue

To finalize and persist these changes, I need to save the product. The "Save" button is clearly visible at the top (bid 900). Clicking it will commit the new configurations to the catalog.
