The user's question asks for the estimated driving time between the city where the Liberty Bell is located and the home city of the Pirates. Interpreting this: the Liberty Bell is in Philadelphia, PA, and the Pittsburgh Pirates are based in Pittsburgh, PA. To get an estimated driving time, I should use OpenStreetMap's directions feature. On the current page, I see the "Find directions between two points" link (id 167) next to the "Go" button. According to the task tips, I should use this two-arrow directions interface to input the start and end locations and then press the button to calculate the route. The first step is to open the directions panel by clicking the "Find directions between two points" link.

✅ Current Progress: Directions panel is open on OpenStreetMap with “Car” selected. No start or destination entered yet, so no route/time has been calculated.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal (finding driving time between two cities). Relevant interactive elements:
- Textbox labeled “From” (id: [194]) — visible, empty.
- Textbox labeled “To” (id: [199]) — visible, empty.
- Radio option “Car” (id: [173]) — checked (driving mode).
- Combobox “Directions services” (id: [182]) — value set to “OSRM”.
- Button “Reverse Directions” (id: [200]) — visible; not needed until after inputs.
Filling the “From” and “To” fields with the target cities will allow the site to compute a route and display the estimated driving time.

The goal is to find the estimated driving time between the city where the Liberty Bell is located (Philadelphia, PA) and the home city of the Pirates (Pittsburgh, PA). We are on OpenStreetMap with the Directions panel visible and "Car" selected, which is correct for driving time. The panel shows two text fields labeled "From" (bid 194) and "To" (bid 199). The correct sequence is to enter "Philadelphia, PA" in the From field and "Pittsburgh, PA" in the To field, then trigger route calculation (often by pressing Enter in one of the fields). Since only one action is allowed at a time, the next best step is to fill the "From" textbox with "Philadelphia, PA".
