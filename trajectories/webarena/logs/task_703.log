The user wants a new marketing price rule for a Thanksgiving sale that applies a $40 discount at checkout for all customers. In Magento, this is typically done by creating a Cart Price Rule.

The next step is to click MARKETING to access the page where I can find "Cart Price Rules". Since only one action is permitted per step, I'll click MARKETING first to navigate into that section.

The user wants a $40 discount applied at checkout for all customers, which corresponds to creating a Cart Price Rule in Magento (not a Catalog Price Rule). The current page shows the Marketing overlay menu with “Promotions” and the visible links “Catalog Price Rule” and “Cart Price Rules.” To start drafting the rule, I should navigate to the Cart Price Rules list by clicking the “Cart Price Rules” link. From there, I can proceed to add a new rule and configure it to apply a fixed $40 discount to the whole cart with no coupon and to all customer groups.

We are on the "New Cart Price Rule" page in Magento Admin where we can configure the Thanksgiving sale rule. To implement a sitewide $40 discount at checkout for all customers, we need to:
- Provide a Rule Name (required).
- Ensure it's Active (already checked).
- Select the Website (e.g., Main Website).
- Select all Customer Groups (NOT LOGGED IN, General, Wholesale, Retailer).
- Keep Coupon as "No Coupon" so it applies automatically.
- Configure the Actions to "Fixed amount discount for whole cart" with Discount Amount = 40.
- Save the rule.

The first actionable step is to set the Rule Name. The "Rule Name *" textbox (bid 782) is empty. I will fill it with the user-specified name, preserving their phrasing: "Thanks giving sale - $40 off". After this, I will proceed to select the Website and Customer Groups, then configure the Actions.

The user's goal is to draft a new cart price rule that gives a $40 discount at checkout for all customers. We are already on the "New Cart Price Rule" page, and key fields are set: Rule Name is "Thanks giving sale - $40 off", Active is Yes, Websites shows Main Website selected, Customer Groups appear all selected, and Coupon is "No Coupon". The remaining critical step is to configure the discount behavior under the "Actions" section to "Fixed amount discount for whole cart" with a discount amount of 40. The Actions section is currently collapsed. To proceed, I should expand the "Actions" section. The accessibility tree lists the "Actions" header as element [912] strong. Clicking this should expand the section so I can configure the Apply dropdown and Discount Amount field. I will perform a single click on the "Actions" section header to expand it.

- Opened “New Cart Price Rule” form.
- Set Rule Name to “Thanks giving sale - $40 off”.
- Active is enabled.
- Website selected: Main Website.
- Customer Groups selected: NOT LOGGED IN, General, Wholesale, Retailer.
- Coupon set to “No Coupon”.
- Actions section opened; Discount Amount shows 40.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is directly on the critical path to draft the $40 checkout discount rule.
- Relevant elements and states:
  - Textbox “Rule Name *” (782) — filled with “Thanks giving sale - $40 off”.
  - Checkbox “Active * Yes” (795) — checked.
  - Listbox “Websites *” (803; option 804) — Main Website selected.
  - Listbox “Customer Groups *” (814; options 815–818) — all selected.
  - Combobox “Coupon” (824) — value “No Coupon”.
  - Actions section:
    - Combobox labeled “Apply” — currently shows “Percent of product price discount” (not aligned with goal).
    - Textbox “Discount Amount *” — value 40 (visible).
  - Save controls: “Save” button (731) and “Save and Continue Edit” (737) — visible/enabled.
  - Conditions section — appears blank, which will apply the rule to all items.
- Minor deviation: The “Apply” type is set to “Percent of product price discount” instead of “Fixed amount discount for whole cart,” which is required to meet the $40-off checkout goal.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- In the Actions section, change the “Apply” dropdown to “Fixed amount discount for whole cart” (combobox labeled “Apply”), ensure “Discount Amount *” remains 40.
- Click the “Save” button (731) to save the rule.

The task is to configure the Actions for the cart price rule so it provides a fixed $40 discount for the entire cart.

- Customer Groups: NOT LOGGED IN, General, Wholesale, Retailer (all)
- Coupon: No Coupon (automatic application)
- Actions: Apply = Fixed amount discount for whole cart; Discount Amount = 40
I then saved the rule. The current page shows the Cart Price Rules list with the success message “You saved the rule.” The table lists entries including “Thanks giving sale - $40 off,” indicating it was saved. To conclude, I should inform the user that the rule has been created and summarize the configuration, and optionally ask if they want dates or other constraints. The single appropriate action is to send a message to the user.
