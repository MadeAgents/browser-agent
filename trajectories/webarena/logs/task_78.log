The next logical step is to click this to open the MARKETING menu, where I can then select the appropriate "All Reviews" page. I will start by clicking MARKETING.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the MARKETING menu from the Dashboard; the “User Content” submenu is visible with “All Reviews” and “Pending Reviews” options.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page (Dashboard) is on the critical path because the open MARKETING > User Content menu provides direct access to the Reviews pages. Relevant interactive elements:
- link “All Reviews” [287] — visible, enabled/clickable.
- link “Pending Reviews” [290] — visible, enabled/clickable.
- link “MARKETING” [226] — currently focused; its vertical menu [231] is expanded and visible.
No errors or off-track indicators detected; proceeding to “All Reviews” is the correct next step toward determining the count of Approved reviews.

The user's goal is to find the total count of Approved reviews across all reviews. From the Dashboard, the MARKETING menu is already expanded, showing the "User Content" section with "All Reviews" and "Pending Reviews". According to the task tips, the "All Reviews" page is where we can find all reviews and their counts. The next step should be to navigate to "All Reviews" so we can filter by Status = Approved and read the total records count (which Magento grids usually display as "X records found"). Therefore, I will click the "All Reviews" link [287].

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to find the total number of Approved reviews. Relevant interactive elements:
- Status filter combobox in the filter row under the “Status” column (element [815]) — visible, enabled, currently unselected/Any.
- “Search” button (element [700]) — visible and enabled.
- “Reset Filter” button (element [703]) — visible and enabled.

- Pagination controls (elements [759], [761]) and “per page” combobox (element [749]) — not required for the count when using filters.

Selecting “Approved” in the Status filter [815] and clicking “Search” [700] will update the “records found” indicator to show the total count of Approved reviews.
