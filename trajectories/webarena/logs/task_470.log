✅ Current Progress: Navigated to Sales → Orders. Currently viewing the Orders grid.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to cancel order 302, but current filters are likely preventing the target order from appearing.
- textbox “Search by keyword” (id: 840) — visible, enabled, currently filled with “Brian Smith”.
- button “Search” (id: 841) — visible, enabled.
- button “Filters” (id: 845) — visible, enabled.
- active filters list shows:
  - “Keyword: Brian Smith” with remove button (id: 854) — visible, enabled.
  - “Status: Canceled” with remove button (id: 859) — visible, enabled.
- button “Clear all” (id: 862) — visible, enabled.
- Orders table is visible; current rows show status “Canceled”, so order 302 (if not canceled yet) will not be listed under these filters.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button “Clear all” (id: 862) to remove the “Keyword: Brian Smith” and “Status: Canceled” filters.
- Type “302” into the textbox labeled “Search by keyword” (id: 840), then click the “Search” button (id: 841) to locate order 000000302.

The task is to cancel order 302. I’m on the Orders grid with the Filters panel open. The keyword filter has been cleared, so now I should use the precise “ID” filter to locate the specific order. In the filters section, there is a textbox labeled “ID” (bid 962). Filling this with “302” will set the filter to match order number 000000302. After that, I will need to click “Apply Filters” to update the grid, and then open the order to cancel it. The immediate next step is to enter “302” into the ID field.

The goal is to cancel order 302. I am on the Magento Admin Orders grid with the Filters panel open. The "ID" textbox (bid 962) is already filled with "302", but the grid still shows "308 records found," indicating the filter hasn't been applied yet. The appropriate next step is to apply the filter using the "Apply Filters" button (bid 1070). Once applied, the grid should narrow to the specific order, allowing me to click its "View" link and then use the cancel action on the order details page. Therefore, I will click "Apply Filters" now.

The goal is to cancel order 302. I am on the Orders grid with the ID filter set to 302, showing exactly one record: order "000000302" with status "Pending". To cancel an order in Magento, the typical workflow is to open the order details page and use the "Cancel" action available there. The row includes a "View" link (bid 9254) under the Action column, which will navigate to the order details page. From there, I can look for and click the "Cancel" button. Therefore, the best next step is to click the "View" link for order 000000302.
