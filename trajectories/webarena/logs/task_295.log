The user wants the git clone command (SSH) for the "metaseq" project. I’m on the GitLab dashboard listing projects, but "metaseq" is not visible in the current list. The tips specify the global search bar is not working and to use the direct search URL pattern. Therefore, the best next step is to navigate to the GitLab search results page for "metaseq" using the provided URL format. From there, I can click into the project and obtain the SSH clone command.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward obtaining the SSH clone command. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link [319] “Administrator / metaseq” — visible and clickable; leads to the project page where clone options are typically available.
- Navigation link [285] “Projects 1” — visible and clickable; filters results to projects (not strictly necessary since the project result is already shown).
- Search box [227] “Search for projects, issues, etc.” — value set to “metaseq”; “Search” button [231] enabled; “Clear” button [228] enabled.

The user asks for the SSH clone command of the "metaseq" project. On the current GitLab search results page, I can see a project result titled "Administrator / metaseq". To retrieve the SSH clone command, I should navigate to the project’s main page, where the “Clone” dropdown typically provides both SSH and HTTPS URLs. Therefore, the next step is to click the "Administrator / metaseq" project link to open the repository page. From there, I can locate the SSH clone URL and form the git clone command.
