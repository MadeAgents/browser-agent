The user wants me to create a new marketing price rule for a spring sale that gives a 20% discount site-wide to all customers. In Magento, price rules are under the Marketing section, typically within Promotions (Catalog Price Rules or Cart Price Rules). To start this process, I should navigate to the Marketing menu from the Dashboard. I see the top navigation bar with a "MARKETING" link (bid 226). Clicking this should open the Marketing section where I can choose the appropriate Promotions page to create the rule. This is the logical first step before filling in rule details like name, websites, customer groups, discount type, and amount.

- link “Cart Price Rules” [243] — visible and clickable.
Both options can be used to set discounts:
- Cart Price Rules apply discounts in the cart/checkout (typical for site-wide promotions for all customers).
- Catalog Price Rules adjust product prices before they’re added to the cart.

The task is to draft a new cart price rule that applies a 20% discount site-wide for all customers. I’m already on the “New Cart Price Rule” page, and some fields are configured: Rule Name is filled, Active is Yes, Websites has “Main Website” selected, and Coupon is “No Coupon.” I started selecting customer groups and have “NOT LOGGED IN” selected. To ensure the rule applies to all customers, I must select the remaining customer groups: General, Wholesale, and Retailer. Since this is a multiselect listbox, I need to use the ControlOrMeta modifier when clicking each option to add to the selection without removing the already selected ones. The next specific step is to select “General” (bid 816) using ControlOrMeta. After selecting all customer groups, I will expand the Actions section and set the discount type to “Percent of product price discount” and amount to 20, then save.

The user asked to draft a new cart price rule for a spring sale that gives a 20% discount site-wide for all customers. I navigated to Marketing > Cart Price Rules, clicked "Add New Rule," and configured the rule: set the name “Spring Sale - 20% Off Sitewide,” Active = Yes, Website = Main Website, Customer Groups = NOT LOGGED IN, General, Wholesale, Retailer (all customers), Coupon = No Coupon, left Conditions blank (site-wide), and set Actions to "Percent of product price discount" with Discount Amount = 20. After saving, I was returned to the Cart Price Rules list, which shows the success banner “You saved the rule.” The table also lists “Spring Sale - 20% Off Sitewide,” confirming the rule exists. The best next step is to inform the user that the rule has been drafted and summarize its configuration, offering to add any date scheduling if needed, since the user didn’t specify start/end dates.

The user asked to draft a new site-wide 20% discount cart price rule for all customers. I navigated to Marketing > Promotions > Cart Price Rules, clicked "Add New Rule," and configured the rule accordingly. I set:
- Rule Name: Spring Sale - 20% Off Sitewide
- Active: Yes
- Websites: Main Website
- Customer Groups: NOT LOGGED IN, General, Wholesale, Retailer (all customers)
- Coupon: No Coupon
- Conditions: left blank (applies site-wide)
- Actions: Apply = Percent of product price discount; Discount Amount = 20

I saved the rule and returned to the Cart Price Rules list, which shows the success banner “You saved the rule.” The new rule appears in the grid (ID 10). The task is completed. The best next step is to inform the user with a concise confirmation and summary and offer to set scheduling dates or priority. I will send a message to the user using send_msg_to_user.
