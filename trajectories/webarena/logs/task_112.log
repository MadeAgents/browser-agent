The user asks to show customers who expressed dissatisfaction with "Circe fleece." On Magento, customer dissatisfaction would typically be reflected in negative product reviews (low ratings or negative comments). The best place to find review details and reviewer names is under MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews (per the provided tips). From there, I can filter by the product name "Circe fleece" (or "Circe" if the full name differs) and then identify reviews with low ratings or negative sentiment, noting the reviewer names.

The user wants the customers who expressed dissatisfaction with “Circe fleece.” We’re already on the Reviews grid page, which is the correct place. To isolate reviews for the Circe fleece, I should use the Product column’s filter in the filter row, then click Search. In the accessibility tree, the Product filter textbox corresponds to bid 851 in the filter row (mapping of headers to filter inputs shows [851] is the Product textbox). The safest initial query is to filter by a keyword like “Circe,” which should capture “Circe Hooded Ice Fleece.” The next step is to fill the Product filter textbox with “Circe.” After that, I’ll click Search and analyze the resulting rows for negative/dissatisfied sentiment and record the reviewers’ names/nicknames.

The user asks to identify customers who expressed dissatisfaction with the Circe fleece.

- Nickname: customer
- Summary: "Good but not perfect"
- Rating appears to be 4/5 stars
- Review text mentions a mildly negative point (muted color) but overall is positive.

Given the instruction to return the FULL Customer name only if known, and that this review is by a Guest (not a registered customer), there are no identifiable customers. Therefore, the correct response is that no registered customers have expressed dissatisfaction; the only related feedback is from a Guest with a mildly critical comment, not outright dissatisfaction. I will communicate this clearly and succinctly, including the supporting details.
