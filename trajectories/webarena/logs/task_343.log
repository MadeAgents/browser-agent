The user wants a list of all opened issues without any labels in the metaseq project. I'm currently on the project overview page. The left sidebar shows a project navigation with an "Issues" link (element [322]). To find issues and apply filters, I should navigate to the Issues page first. On GitLab, the Issues list typically provides filters for state (Open/Closed) and labels, where I can select "Label: None" or similar. The best next step is to click the "Issues" link in the project navigation to access the issue list and then apply appropriate filters. This aligns with the benchmark tip to use search/filters instead of scrolling. I'll click the "Issues" link now.

- Issue list container (id [617]) — shows current open issues.

To achieve the goal, use the “Search or filter results...” field to apply a filter that returns only open issues with no labels.

The user wants all open issues without any labels in the metaseq project. I am on the Issues page with "Open 95" selected. I attempted to filter via the search input by entering "label:none" and clicking Search, but the result list still shows many issues with label chips, indicating the filter may not have been applied by this instance's search box. A robust way in GitLab to show unlabeled issues is to add the query parameter label_name[]=None to the issues URL, alongside state=opened and current sort. This should filter server-side and return only unlabeled open issues. Therefore, the best next action is to navigate directly to the filtered URL including label_name[]=None while retaining existing parameters.

The user wants all open issues without labels. I'm on the Issues list for the metaseq project with the Open tab selected. The search/filter box shows "label:none", but the results still include issues with labels, indicating the filter hasn't been applied effectively via the textbox. A reliable way to filter unlabeled issues in GitLab is to use the URL parameter label_name[]=None along with state=opened. To proceed efficiently and avoid further ambiguity with the search box tokenization, I will navigate directly to the issues list URL with the appropriate parameters to ensure only unlabeled open issues are returned. After loading the filtered page, I can read the list (and paginate if needed) to provide the full set.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the project’s Issues page.
- “Open” tab is selected.
- Applied the “no labels” filter (Label = ~None). The list now reflects open issues without labels.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path and appears correctly filtered for the goal.
- Relevant elements:
  - Tab “Open 5” (id [505]) — selected.
  - Filter bar shows “Label = ~None” (group [532]); control buttons “Close” ([577]), “Clear” ([581]), and “Search” ([584]) — all visible/enabled.
  - Sorting controls “Updated date” ([588]) and “Sort direction: Descending” ([644]) — visible.
  - Issue list container (list [648]) — visible with issue title links (e.g., first item link [652] “Fine-tune and collect data for fine-tuning OPT models”). These links are enabled and represent the unlabeled, open issues to be listed.
- No signs of being off-track; results page is ready for extraction of the unlabeled open issues.
