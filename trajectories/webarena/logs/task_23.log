The user wants reviewers who mention good fingerprint resistance. I’m on the product page which shows there are 12 reviews. To find relevant mentions, I need to open the Reviews tab to view the review texts and authors. The page shows a tablist with "Details" and "Reviews (12)". The element [1665] is a clickable link labeled "Reviews (12)". Clicking it should switch to the reviews panel where I can read the reviews and identify any that mention fingerprints, smudges, or oleophobic coating, then list the reviewer names. I will click the "Reviews (12)" tab now.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the Reviews section for the product and identified at least one reviewer mentioning good fingerprint resistance: “Rachel” (“super clear and fingerprint resistant”).

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is directly relevant to the goal. The Reviews tab appears active (clicked element: “Reviews (12)” id=1665). Relevant elements:
- Link “12 Reviews” (id=1534), visible and clickable.
- Link “Add Your Review” (id=1537), visible and clickable.
- Customer Reviews list is visible in the screenshot; review texts and reviewer names are readable (e.g., “Rachel” explicitly mentions fingerprint resistance). Further reviews may need to be scanned/scrolling to confirm additional mentions.

The user wants the names of reviewers who mention good fingerprint resistance. On the current Reviews (12) tab, I can already see two matches on page 1:
- Rachel: “It is super clear and fingerprint resistant.”

To ensure completeness, I should also check page 2 of reviews to see if there are additional mentions of fingerprint resistance. The pagination shows a “Page 2” link (bid 2058). Clicking it should load the second page of reviews, where I can scan for any further mentions of fingerprints or smudge resistance. I will click the Page 2 link next.
