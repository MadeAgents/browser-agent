✅ Current Progress: Reached the “My Account” dashboard. The page shows the “Recent Orders” section with an orders table.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to finding the order date for order number 148.
- Relevant elements:
  - “Recent Orders” table (heading visible as “Recent Orders”): shows columns Order #, Date, Ship To, Order Total, Status, and Action. Each row includes a “View Order” link (visible/clickable) in the Action column. You can scan for order number “148” (often formatted like “000000148”) and open its details to read the order date.
  - Left sidebar navigation includes link “My Orders” (visible/clickable). If order 148 isn’t in Recent Orders, this link likely leads to the full order history to locate “148.”
- Other elements present but not needed: top Search combobox and disabled “Search” button.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated from My Account to the full “My Orders” page. The orders table is visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to finding the date for order number 148.
- Main elements:
  - Heading “My Orders” [1356] confirming correct page.
  - Orders table [1362] with headers: Order # [1366], Date [1367], Order Total [1368], Status [1369], Action [1370].
  - Visible rows include recent orders:
    - Order # “000000197” [1373] with Date “12/16/25” [1374]; Action includes “View Order” link [1379] (enabled).
    - Order # “000000196” [1384] with Date “12/16/25” [1385]; “View Order” link [1390] (enabled).
    - Order # “000000195” [1395] with Date “12/16/25” [1396]; “View Order” link [1401] (enabled).
    - Additional rows follow (truncated), indicating descending order numbers.
  - The screenshot shows pagination text “Items 1 to 10 of 45 total” with page links (1–5) visible, implying older orders (including “000000148”) are on later pages. Specific node IDs for pagination are not present in the provided axtree excerpt.
- Conclusion: To locate order “000000148,” use the table pagination to navigate to older pages, then read the Date cell in the row for “000000148.”

The user wants the order date for order number 148. I’m on the “My Orders” page with a paginated orders table showing recent orders (197 down to 189 and 170) on page 1.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the My Orders page and navigated to older pages via pagination. Currently viewing the older orders (page shows “Items 31 to 40 of 45 total”). Order 000000148 has not been identified yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is directly relevant to the goal. The Orders table [1362] is visible with columns Order # [1366], Date [1367], Order Total [1368], Status [1369], and Action [1370]. Rows currently visible include examples such as:
- Order # 000000185 [1373] with Date 10/3/22 [1374] and “View Order” link [1379]
- Order # 000000179 [1384] with Date 9/29/22 [1385] and “View Order” link [1390]
- Order # 000000175 [1395] with Date 9/1/22 [1396] and “View Order” link [1401]
Pagination controls (numbers/Next) are present and enabled (e.g., page links [1502]/[1506], Next [1510]), allowing navigation to adjacent pages to find order 000000148. No errors or off-track indicators; continue locating the row for Order # 000000148 and read its Date cell.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the My Orders page and paginated to the oldest list (Items 41–45 of 45 total). Checked the rows on this page but order 000000148 is not present yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is relevant to the goal. The Orders table [1362] is visible with columns Order # [1366], Date [1367], Order Total [1368], Status [1369], and Action [1370]. Current rows include:

- Order # 000000160 [1406] with Date 3/2/22 [1407]
Pagination controls are visible (links labeled 1–5 plus Next), and the current view shows “Items 41 to 45 of 45 total.” Since 000000148 is not on this page, remaining relevant navigation is the pagination link labeled “4” (enabled), which previously showed order 000000149—suggesting 000000148 should be nearby on that page.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the pagination link labeled “4” (Page 4; previously interacted element id ~ [1451]) to load items 31–40.
- In the Orders table [1362], locate the row where the Order # gridcell equals “000000148” and read the Date value from the adjacent Date column [1367].

The Orders table [1362] is visible with columns Order # [1366], Date [1367], Order Total [1368], Status [1369], and Action [1370].

Relevant interactive elements for progress:
- Pagination controls below the table: page links “1” [1494], “2” [1498], “3” [1502], “5” [1506], and “Next” [1510] are visible and enabled; current page “4” is selected (non-clickable).
- Each row has an enabled “View Order” link (e.g., [1379], [1390], [1401]) to open order details if needed.
To achieve the goal, the agent needs to locate the row where Order # = 000000148 and read its adjacent Date value.

✅ Current Progress: On the “My Orders” page. Paginated through multiple pages (visited pages 5 and 4) and now on page 3. Order #000000148 has not been located yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is relevant to the goal. The Orders table [1362] is visible with columns Order # [1366], Date [1367], Order Total [1368], Status [1369], and Action [1370]. Current view shows items “21 to 30 of 45 total” (page 3). Relevant interactive elements:
- Table rows each contain enabled “View Order” links (e.g., [1379], [1390], [1401]).
- Pagination controls beneath the table show page links “1”, “2”, “3” (current, selected), “4”, “5”, and “Next” (all visible/enabled per screenshot; page “3” corresponds to link [1502], “5” previously [1506]).
Given that page 4 previously contained order 000000149, order 000000148 is more likely on page 4 (or 5) than on the current page 3. Navigating to page 3 appears counterproductive.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the pagination link labeled “4” (below the Orders table; previously referenced as page link id “1451”) to load page 4.
- If Order #000000148 is listed there, click the “View Order” link in that row to confirm and read the Date value from either the row or the order details page.

The user requests the order date for order number 148. I’m currently on the “My Orders” page, page 2 (Items 11 to 20 of 45 total). In the orders table, I can see a row with Order # 000000148. The adjacent Date column for that row shows “1/29/23.” Since the exact information is visible, the next step is to report this date back to the user clearly and succinctly.
