The user asks: Which customer has completed the most number of orders in the entire history? Based on Magento and the provided Task Tips, I should use the Reports section, likely under REPORTS > Customers > Orders (Order Count/Customers by Orders Total). I need to set the date range from Jan 1, 2022 to today and filter order status to "Complete" to get "completed orders". Then I will sort by number of orders descending and extract the top customer's full name. 

Currently I'm on the Dashboard with the top navigation menu visible. The REPORTS link (id 339) is present in the menubar. The next logical step is to click REPORTS to access the reports menu and then navigate to the appropriate customer orders report. I will click the REPORTS link first to reveal/select the reports area.

Goal: Identify which customer has completed the most number of orders in the entire history.

We’re already on Reports > Customers > Order Count Report. The table is empty because no date range is set. Based on Task Tips:
- The store operates since 2022 (Tip 8); for entire history we should set From 01/01/2022 to Today.
- This specific report UI shows From, To, Show By, and Refresh. No status filter is visible here, so we proceed with the available filters. The “Show By” control can be set to Year to reduce rows.

Plan:
1) Enter From date as 01/01/2022 in the From textbox (bid 731).
2) Enter To date as today in the To textbox (after this).
3) Change Show By to Year (bid 745).
4) Click Refresh (bid 749).
5) Review the resulting table and identify the customer with the highest Orders count (may need to scan or sort if possible).

First action now: fill the From date field.

The user's goal is to find which customer has completed the most number of orders in the entire history. We are on the "Order Count Report" page under Reports > Customers. According to the Task Tips, to retrieve historical order stats we should select a date range from 01/01/2022 to Today and then generate the report. The "From" date (01/01/2022) and "To" date (12/18/2025) appear already set. The table currently shows “We can't find records for this period,” likely because the report hasn’t been refreshed yet. Before refreshing, it’s helpful to set "Show By" to “Year” to aggregate results by year, which reduces clutter and helps scanning.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page “Order Count Report” is directly relevant to the goal.
- Relevant elements:
  - From date textbox (id=731): value “01/1/2022”, enabled.

  - “Show By” combobox (id=745): value “Year”, enabled.
  - Refresh button (id=749): visible, enabled.
  - Results table (id=762): populated.
- Evidence from table:
  - 2022 section: row shows Customer “Jane Smith” (gridcell id=778) with Orders “8” (gridcell id=779). Other 2022 customers show ≤5 orders.
  - 2023 section: customers show ≤2 orders.
  - 2024 and 2025 sections: “We can't find records for this period.”
Conclusion: No customer across all years exceeds Jane Smith’s count; therefore, Jane Smith has completed the most orders overall.

The user asks for the customer who has completed the most orders over the store’s entire history. I’m on the “Order Count Report” under Reports > Customers, with the date range already set from 01/1/2022 to 12/18/2025 and Show By set to Year. The table is populated. I need to identify the highest Orders count across the entire report.

Scanning the rows:
- In 2022, the highest “Orders” value is 8 for Jane Smith. Other customers in 2022 have at most 5 orders.
- In 2023, the highest “Orders” value is 5 (Michael Nguyen). No rows for 2024/2025.
Thus, the maximum orders completed by any single customer in the entire period is 8, belonging to Jane Smith. The question asks which customer has completed the most orders; returning the full customer name is required.

I will now answer with the customer name.
