The user wants the order number of the most recent "under delivery" order, which per the provided tips corresponds to orders with status "processing." To find this, I should navigate to the user's order history. On the current One Stop Market homepage, I see a "My Account" link in the header (bid 227), and the user is logged in (it says "Welcome, Emma Lopez!" and "Sign Out" is visible). The logical next step is to click "My Account" to reach the account dashboard where I can then access "My Orders" and filter/identify the most recent order with status "processing." I will click the "My Account" link.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the My Account dashboard showing the “Recent Orders” table. No “under delivery” (Processing) order identified yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly relevant to the goal. The “Recent Orders” section (heading marker [1457]) lists several recent orders with columns for Order #, Date, Ship To, Order Total, Status, and Action. The visible Status entries appear as “Pending,” so the most recent “under delivery” (Processing) order is not yet identified here.
Relevant interactive elements:
- Sidebar link “My Orders” (marker [1451]) — visible and enabled; likely leads to full order history.
- “View Order” links in the Recent Orders table (e.g., markers [1491], [1493], [1495], [1497], [1499], [1501]) — visible and enabled for inspecting individual orders.
- Order number links/cells in the Recent Orders table (e.g., markers [1479], [1483], [1487]) — visible; may also open order details.

The goal is to find the order number of the most recent "under delivery" order, which per the provided tip corresponds to orders with status "Processing."

To find all orders and potentially filter or sort to locate a "Processing" one, the best next step is to navigate to the full order history page.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “My Orders” page and opened the full order history. The first three orders shown are in “Pending” status; the most recent “under delivery” (Processing) order has not yet been identified.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to the goal. The “Orders” table (table [1362], heading [1356]) is visible and lists orders with columns:
- Column headers: “Order #” [1366], “Date” [1367], “Order Total” [1368], “Status” [1369], “Action” [1370].
- Rows currently visible (descending by recency):
  - Row 1: Order # [1373] “000000197”, Status [1377] “Pending”, Action has “View Order” link [1379] (enabled).
  - Row 2: Order # [1384] “000000196”, Status [1388] “Pending”, “View Order” link [1390] (enabled).
  - Row 3: Order # [1395] “000000195”, Status [1399] “Pending”, “View Order” link [1401] (enabled).
  - Row 4: Order # [1406] “000000194” (date [1407] “12/16/25”); status cell exists but is not shown in the provided tree snippet.
- Goal-relevant element states: The table is readable; each row has an enabled “View Order” link (e.g., [1379], [1390], [1401]) for drilling into details if needed. To fulfill the goal, identify the most recent row where the Status column equals “Processing” and record its corresponding “Order #”. If not present among the first rows, continue scanning the table (additional rows are present on this page).

Instead of paging one-by-one (which is slow and can lead to errors like the last timeout), the most efficient approach is to increase the number of items shown per page using the “Show per page” control. There is a combobox set to 10 with options for 20 and 50 (bid 1519). Selecting “50” should display up to 50 items on one page, likely covering all 45 orders. This will let me quickly spot any orders with status “Processing” and identify the most recent one without further pagination.

2025-12-18 14:02:57,941 - 4148439 - agent - INFO - Progress summary generated:
✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to “My Orders.”
- Set “Show per page” to 50; all 45 orders are displayed on one page.
- Reviewed the list: no orders have Status “Processing” (i.e., “under delivery”). The newest orders at the top (000000197, 000000196, 000000195) are “Pending.”

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is directly on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant interactive elements (visible and enabled):
  - Orders table [1362] under heading “My Orders” [1356].
  - Rows (newest first):
    - Order # [1373] 000000197 — Status [1377] “Pending”; Action: “View Order” link [1379].
    - Order # [1384] 000000196 — Status [1388] “Pending”; Action: “View Order” link [1390].
    - Order # [1395] 000000195 — Status [1399] “Pending”; Action: “View Order” link [1401].
- Observation: Across the displayed rows, statuses are “Pending,” “Complete,” or “Canceled”; none show “Processing,” so there is currently no under-delivery order to extract an order number from.
