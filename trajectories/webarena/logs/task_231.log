The user wants the order number of their most recent cancelled order. According to the task tips, the path is My Account > My Orders to find order details. On the current homepage, I see a "My Account" link [227] in the banner, and the user is logged in ("Welcome, Emma Lopez!"). The next logical step is to click "My Account" to access the account dashboard, where I can then navigate to "My Orders" and identify the most recent cancelled order. I will start by clicking the My Account link.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the My Account dashboard; the Recent Orders table is visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is directly relevant to the goal. In the “Recent Orders” table ([1534]), the first row shows Status “Canceled.” The order number for that canceled order is displayed in the “Order #” column of that same row, visible on this page. Relevant interactive elements:
- “View All” link ([1530]) — visible and enabled; opens the full orders list.
- “View Order” link for the canceled row ([1555]) — visible and enabled; opens detailed order page.
- “Reorder” link for the canceled row ([1566]) — visible and enabled; not needed for the goal.

The user wants the order number of their most recent cancelled order. On the current "My Account" page, there is a "Recent Orders" table visible. I scanned the rows and identified the statuses:
- Row 1: Status "Canceled" with Order # "000000170" and Date "5/17/23".
- Subsequent rows show "Pending" or "Complete".

Since the first row is the only "Canceled" entry visible and has the latest date among canceled orders shown, it corresponds to the most recent cancelled order. The required information (order number) is already present, so I can directly provide it without navigating elsewhere.
