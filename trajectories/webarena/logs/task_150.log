The user asks for the price configuration of the fake tree they bought in January 2023. The best way to find this is to view their past orders and locate the relevant order in Jan 2023, then inspect the line item details for the fake tree to see pricing (unit price, quantity, discounts, options). On the current homepage, there is a "My Account" link in the header (bid 227). According to the tips, to view previous purchases we should go to My Account > My Orders. The logical next step is to click "My Account" to navigate to the account dashboard, where I expect to find "My Orders" or "Orders" to filter by date or scan for Jan 2023 purchases. I will click the "My Account" link now.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the My Account dashboard where order history is accessible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to find the price configuration of the fake tree purchased in Jan 2023. Relevant elements:
- Link “View All” for Recent Orders (axtree id: [1530]) — visible and enabled. This should open the full order history.
- Table “Recent Orders” (axtree id: [1534]) — visible; each row includes an “Action” column with “View Order” links (visible on the screenshot and enabled) to open detailed order pages.
- Left sidebar shows “My Orders” navigation (visible in screenshot), which should also lead to full order history.

These elements should be used to locate orders from January 2023 and open the specific order detail page to view pricing breakdowns.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the My Orders page and loaded the full order list. No specific January 2023 order has been opened yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to find the price configuration of the fake tree purchased in Jan 2023. Relevant elements:
- Orders table [1474] “Orders” — visible with date-sorted rows.
- “View Order” links in the Action column for each row — enabled and visible:
  - [1491] “View Order” (order dated 5/17/23)
  - [1502] “View Order” (order dated 5/2/23)
  - [1513] “View Order” (order dated 5/2/23)
  - Additional rows on this page show dates down to February 2023 (per screenshot); January 2023 orders are not on the current page.
- Pagination controls below the table (visible in screenshot: page links “1 2 3 4 …” and a “Show 10 per page” selector) — these are needed to reach January 2023 orders.
The next required step is to navigate to older pages via the pagination controls, then open the January 2023 order using its “View Order” link to see the detailed pricing/configuration.
