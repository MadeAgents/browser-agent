The user asks for the minimum travel time by car from REI to CMU using the OpenStreetMap site currently open. According to the Task Tips, I should use the "two arrow" button (Find directions) to get routes and ensure to use the "press" button after entering the start and end locations. The Accessibility Tree shows a link labeled "Find directions between two points" with bid 167. The best next step is to click that to open the directions panel where I can input REI and CMU (ensuring Pittsburgh, PA). After the panel opens, I will proceed to fill in the locations and select the car profile, then press to calculate. For now, the next single action is to open the directions interface by clicking the directions link.
