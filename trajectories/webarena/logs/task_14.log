The user wants the count of reviews containing the term "not useful". On Magento, reviews are managed under MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews, as per the tips. From there, I should use filtering or a search field to find reviews that include the exact phrase "not useful" in the review text/title and then read the count. Currently, we are on the Dashboard. The appropriate next step is to navigate to the MARKETING section. The accessibility tree shows a "MARKETING" link with bid [226] in the top navigation menu. Clicking that should open the Marketing menu or its page where I can access User Content > All Reviews. I will click the MARKETING link now.

The user asks for the number of reviews that mention the term "not useful."

From there, I can use filtering to search for reviews containing the specified term and then get the count. 

The current page is the Dashboard, and the Marketing slide-out menu is already open, showing "All Reviews" as an option (node [287]). The next logical step is to navigate to the All Reviews page to access the list and filtering controls. Therefore, I will click the "All Reviews" link to proceed.

The user needs the total count of reviews that mention the term "not useful." I'm on the Reviews grid under Marketing > User Content > All Reviews. To find the count efficiently, I should use the filter row in the grid. The filter inputs are visible beneath each column header. Based on the accessibility tree mapping, the textbox [825] corresponds to the "Review" column (after Title [821] and Nickname [823]). 

Plan:
1) Enter "not useful" in the Review filter textbox [825].
2) Click the "Search" button [700] to apply the filter.
3) Read the updated "records found" indicator [741] to get the count and report it.

I will start by filling the Review filter input with "not useful."
