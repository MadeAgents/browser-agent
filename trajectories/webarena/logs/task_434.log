The user wants me to add to the cart the product with the lowest per unit price from the two open tabs. I need to compare the price and unit count on each tab. The active Tab 1 shows a price of $12.99 for a "3 Pack," but to determine the lowest per unit price, I must also check Tab 0 ("3 Pairs Ruffle Socks...") for its price and unit count. The most efficient next step is to switch to Tab 0 to view its price information, then I can compute per unit comparisons. After determining the lower per unit price, I'll add that product to the cart, considering any required options like color. First, I'll focus Tab 0 to inspect its details.

The goal is to add to the cart the product with the lowest per unit price among the two open product tabs. On the current Tab 0 page, I can see the price is $14.99 and the pack is "3 Pairs". The history mentions Tab 1 shows a price of $12.99 for a "3 Pack", which likely corresponds to 3 pairs as well, but I should verify the exact price and any required options before adding to cart. To compare and ensure I add the correct lower per unit item, I need to switch to Tab 1 to confirm its price and see if there are any mandatory selections (e.g., color) before clicking Add to Cart. The next best action is to bring Tab 1 to the front.

The goal is to add the product with the lowest per unit price from the open tabs to the cart. I already determined that Tab 1 (VIVIKI Women Glitter Socks 3 Pack at $12.99) has a lower per-unit price than Tab 0 ($14.99 for 3 pairs). To add it to the cart, I must satisfy required options. The product shows a required Color field (indicated by an asterisk), and none of the radio options are currently selected. The next step is to select a color so that the "Add to Cart" button can be used. I will choose the first available color option, "Black," by clicking its radio button.

The task is to add the product with the lowest per unit price from the open tabs to the cart. I compared the two tabs: Tab 0 shows $14.99 for "3 Pairs," while the active Tab 1 shows $12.99 for a "3 Pack" (which aligns with 3 pairs). Therefore, Tab 1 has the lower per-unit price. On Tab 1, the "Color" option is required (marked with an asterisk). I already selected "Black" (radio [1642] is checked), and the quantity is set to 1. The next step to fulfill the goal is to click the "Add to Cart" button [1671].
