The goal is to find the least expensive SSD hard drive with at least 1TB capacity. According to the site tips, I should browse categories using the dropdown menus rather than search. The Electronics menu is already expanded. Within it, “Computers & Accessories” is the most relevant path to find SSDs. Hovering over “Computers & Accessories” should reveal a deeper submenu where storage or SSD-specific categories (e.g., “Internal SSDs,” “Hard Drives & Storage”) are likely listed. From there, I can navigate to SSDs, and then use sorting/filters (e.g., capacity >= 1TB, sort by price ascending) to identify the least expensive qualifying product.

- Opened the search results page for “1TB SSD.”
- Sorting is set to Price in ascending order.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path, but the current results include many non-SSD products and accessories; refinement is needed to isolate actual SSDs with ≥1TB capacity.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Related search term: link “SSD 1TB” (id: 1397), visible/clickable; likely narrows results to SSD-specific items.
  - Sort control: combobox “Sort By” (id: 1388), value=Price, enabled; direction toggle link shows “Set Descending Direction” (id: 1392), indicating current order is ascending (lowest first).
  - Search bar: combobox “Search” (id: 274) contains “1TB SSD”; “Search” button (id: 279) is disabled until the query changes.
  - View toggle: “View as List” (id: 1380), visible, may help with scanning details.
- Results show “Items 1–12 of 504,” confirming a broad, noisy set that requires filtering to meet the goal (SSD, ≥1TB).

The user wants the least expensive SSD hard drive with at least 1TB capacity. I'm on a search results page for "1TB SSD," sorted by Price in ascending order (the control shows "Set Descending Direction"), but many results are irrelevant (consoles, PCs, accessories). To narrow to actual SSDs without scrolling, I should use available filtering or related searches. In the sidebar above the results, there's a "Related search terms" section with a link "SSD 1TB" (bid 1397). Clicking this should refine the query to better target SSDs and reduce noise. After that, I can verify the cheapest valid SSD. So the next best action is to click the related search term "SSD 1TB."

✅ Current Progress:
- Reached the search results page for “SSD 1TB.”
- Used a related search term to refine to “SSD 1TB.”
- No capacity filter applied; results are still broad and not price-ordered.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is relevant to the goal, but results include many non-SSD items (e.g., desktops), so refinement and price sorting are needed to identify the cheapest qualifying SSD.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Sort control: combobox “Sort By” (id: 1389), current value=Relevance; options include “Price” (enabled/visible).
  - Sort direction toggle: link “Set Ascending Direction” (id: 1393), visible; indicates results are not currently ordered from lowest to highest price.
  - View toggle: link “View as List” (id: 1381), visible.
  - Search bar: combobox “Search” (id: 275) value='SSD 1TB'; “Search” button (id: 280) is disabled.
  - Related search terms: “1TB SSD” (id: 1398), already used.
- Observed candidates include SSDs (e.g., SK hynix Gold S31 1TB SATA SSD at $97.99), but with 504 items and no price-ascending order, the least expensive item cannot yet be confirmed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Select “Price” in the “Sort By” combobox (id='1389').
- Click the sort direction control “Set Ascending Direction” (id='1393') to ensure lowest price appears first.

The user wants the least expensive SSD hard drive with at least 1TB capacity. The current search results for "SSD 1TB" are sorted by price ascending but include many irrelevant items (consoles, accessories). Following the site tips, it's better to use the top navigation to narrow to a specific category and then apply filters. The Electronics mega menu is open, and within it the "Computers & Accessories" submenu shows "Data Storage" (bid 879). Clicking "Data Storage" should take me to a focused category where I can further filter to SSDs and capacity, then sort by price to find the cheapest 1TB SSD. Since the submenu is already exposed from my last hover, the best next step is to click the "Data Storage" menu item.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated via Electronics → Computers & Accessories → Data Storage.
- Previously attempted search and sorting steps, but the current view is back on the broad Data Storage category.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is related to the goal but too broad: it lists mixed storage items (USB drives, HDDs, etc.) with 200 results and no visible SSD or capacity filters.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Search input combobox labeled “Search” (id: 275) — visible, empty, enabled; hasPopup='listbox', expanded=False.
  - “Search” button (id: 280) — visible, currently disabled (will enable after typing).
  - Sort controls in the category:
    - “Sort By” combobox (id: 1392) — value='Position'; options include 'Product Name' and 'Price'; enabled.
    - Sort direction toggle link “Set Descending Direction” (id: 1396) — visible; toggles sort order after a sort field is chosen.
- Assessment: Being on an unfiltered Data Storage listing is not optimal for finding the least expensive 1TB SSD; a targeted search or SSD-specific category is needed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Type '1TB SSD' into the search input (combobox id='275').
- Click the “Search” button (id='280') once it becomes enabled.

Strategy: Use the top navigation to target the specific SSD category (e.g., Electronics → Computers & Accessories → Data Storage → Solid State Drives). From there, I can sort by price to find the cheapest 1TB SSD. The top menu includes "Electronics" (id 817) with a popup. Hovering it should reveal nested subcategories, allowing me to navigate to a Solid State Drives category.

Next step: Hover on "Electronics" to expand the submenu and proceed toward SSD category.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened search results for “1TB SSD”.
- Sorting is set to Price in ascending order (control shows “Set Descending Direction”).
- Increased results per page (previously changed via “Show” combobox to 36).
- Opened the top navigation mega menu by hovering “Electronics”.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is relevant to the goal but results are noisy (many non-SSD items). We still need to identify the cheapest actual SSD with ≥1TB capacity.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Sort By combobox (id: 1389/1388), current value: “Price”, visible/enabled.
  - Sort direction toggle (id: 1392), text: “Set Descending Direction” (indicates ascending order), visible/enabled.
  - “Show” combobox (id: 1824), increased to display more items per page, visible/enabled.
  - Search field (id: 274), value: “1TB SSD”, visible; Search button (id: 279) currently disabled (requires editing input).
  - Related search link “SSD 1TB” (id: 1397), visible/enabled.
  - Top navigation: “Electronics” menuitem (id: 817, hasPopup=menu, currently hovered/open) and submenu item “Computers & Accessories” (id: 923, hasPopup=menu), both visible/enabled.
- We are on the critical path, but still need to narrow to SSD-specific listings (ideally the SSD category or capacity filters) to surface the least expensive 1TB SSD.

 <think>
The user wants the least expensive SSD hard drive with at least 1TB capacity. The current search results for “1TB SSD” sorted by price ascending show many irrelevant items (consoles, hubs, cases) and no actual SSDs in the first 36 results. To efficiently find a true SSD product, I should leverage the site’s top navigation to reach the specific SSD category where filters may be available or where listings are focused. The top menu shows “Electronics” with a submenu and includes “Computers & Accessories” (bid 923). Hovering over “Computers & Accessories” should reveal deeper options like “Data Storage” and potentially “Solid State Drives.” Then I can navigate to SSDs and sort by price to find the cheapest 1TB model. Therefore, the next action is to hover on “Computers & Accessories” to expose its submenu.
