The user wants to preview the Magento Luma theme for their shop. The simplest way to "preview" the active storefront theme is to open the shop’s frontend. Since we’re currently on the Magento Admin dashboard, and the storefront is served at the same host, I can navigate directly to the root URL of the site to view the frontend. This should display the Luma-themed storefront, which fulfills the preview request without needing to adjust any admin settings. I will use a single goto action to open http://10.177.37.113:7780/.

The user's goal is to preview the Magento Luma theme. The current tab shows the Luma storefront homepage, which is the default Luma theme. The accessibility tree and screenshot confirm standard Luma elements: store logo, top navigation (What's New, Women, Men, Gear, Training, Sale), search bar, hero/promotional banners, and the "Hot Sellers" product grid with typical Luma UI components (ratings, sizes/colors, Add to Cart, Wish List, Compare). Since the preview is achieved by viewing the frontend, the best next step is to inform the user that the Luma theme is visible and offer to navigate to other sections (category pages or product detail pages) to extend the preview. I'll send a concise confirmation and optional next steps via send_msg_to_user.
