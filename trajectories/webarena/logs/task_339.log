✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the project’s Issues section and opened the “Open” issues list (42 items). No bug-specific filter has been applied yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path for listing open bug reports.
- Tabs:
  - tab “Open 42” [600]: selected (correct for open issues).
  - tab “Closed 570” [604]: not selected.
  - tab “All 612” [608]: not selected.
- Results container: tabpanel “Open 42” [612] displays the open issues list.
- Filtering controls:
  - A search/filter input with visible placeholder “Search or filter results…” is present below the tabs (appears empty).
  - Filter chips/menus including “Label” are visible next to the search input (no label selected yet).
- Other controls (not essential for filtering): “Export as CSV” [622], “Import issues” [625], “Edit issues” [640], “New issue” [642].

To achieve the goal, the next needed action on this page is to apply a label filter for “bug” (or equivalent) via the “Label” filter control so that only open issues reporting bugs are shown.

The user asks to list all opened issues that report bugs. We’re on the project’s Issues page with the "Open 42" tab selected. To isolate bug reports, the most efficient approach is to apply a filter for the "bug" label using the search/filter control rather than manually scanning each item or paginating. The page shows a textbox labeled "Search or filter results..." (bid 666) accompanied by a Search button. The next step is to focus the textbox so I can either select a "Label" token from any suggestion dropdown or manually enter a label-based query (e.g., label: bug) and then execute the search. Therefore, I will click the search/filter textbox to start applying the label filter.
