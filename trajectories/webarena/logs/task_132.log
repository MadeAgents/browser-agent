The user asks how many commits "kilian" made to "a11yproject" on 3/5/2023. From the dashboard, I see a project "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com," which likely corresponds to "a11yproject." To find commit counts by a specific author on a date, I should navigate into that repository and then view the Commits page (Repository > Commits). From there, I can look for commits from "kilian" on March 5, 2023. Since scrolling is not supported, I may need to use any available filters or navigate by date/author on the Commits page. The next step is to click into the "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" repository from the Projects dashboard.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the a11yproject.com project page on GitLab. Commit history has not been opened or filtered yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal, as it provides direct navigation to the repository’s commit history.
- Link “2,320 Commits” (id: 687) — visible and clickable; should lead directly to the project’s commits list.
- Link “Repository” (id: 297) — visible and clickable; can be used to access repository subsections (including Commits) if needed.
- Textbox “Search GitLab” (id: 146) — visible, empty, enabled; global search (less precise than using the Commits page).

The user asks for the number of commits made by "kilian" to the a11yproject on 3/5/2023. I'm currently on the project overview page for The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com. To find specific commits by author and date, I need to navigate to the commit history. The page has a clearly labeled link "2,320 Commits" (bid 687) that should open the repository's commits list where I can use available filters (author/search) to narrow down to "kilian" and inspect dates. Given the benchmark tips stress using search/filters instead of scrolling, this is the best next step. I will click the "2,320 Commits" link to access the commit history.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the repository’s Commits page for The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com. No author filter applied yet; commits are grouped by date (March 2023 visible).

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to the goal (counting commits by “kilian” on 03/05/2023).
- Button “Author” (id: 800) — visible, enabled, hasPopup menu, expanded=False. Use this to filter commits by author “kilian.”
- Searchbox “Search by message” (id: 842) — visible, empty, enabled; useful for message text but not for author filtering.
- Branch selector button “main” (id: 588) — visible, enabled, not required for this task.
- Commits list (id: 847) — shows date-grouped entries, including March 2023 headings (e.g., “05 Mar, 2023” with associated commit items). Filtering by author will allow counting the commits under the “05 Mar, 2023” group for “kilian.”

The user asks for the number of commits made by “kilian” on 03/05/2023 in the a11yproject repository. I’m already on the Commits page for The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com, with commits grouped by date. I can see a section labeled “05 Mar, 2023” that shows “1 commit,” and the single commit listed under that date is authored by “Kilian Valkhof” at “Mar 5, 2023 7:47pm GMT.” This directly answers the question without needing to use filters or scroll. I will report the count.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com repository’s Commits page.
- March 2023 date groups are visible. No author filter applied yet. A preliminary answer (“1”) was sent without confirming the author.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is directly on the critical path to the goal (counting commits by a specific author on a specific date).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Button “Author” (id: 800) — visible, enabled, hasPopup menu, expanded=False. Use to filter commits by author “Kilian Valkhof”.
  - Searchbox “Search by message” (id: 842) — visible, empty, enabled (not needed for author filtering).
  - Commits list (id: 847) — shows date-grouped entries (e.g., “14 Mar, 2023 · 2 commits”); will display only Kilian’s commits once filtered.
- Deviation detected: An answer was provided without verifying that the March 5, 2023 commit(s) were authored by “kilian”.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button “Author” (id='800') and select “Kilian Valkhof” from the menu to filter by author.
- After filtering, locate the “05 Mar, 2023” group within the commits list (id='847') and read the count shown next to that date to confirm the exact number of commits.
