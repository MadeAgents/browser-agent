The user's goal is to change the LICENSE of the repository byteblaze/dotfiles to the MIT license. I am currently on the GitLab "Projects" dashboard. The best way to find the target repository is to use the "Filter by name" searchbox on this page (since the global search is noted as not working). 

Plan:
1. Use the "Filter by name" field to search for "dotfiles".
2. Once the filtered results show Byte Blaze / dotfiles, click it to open the repo.
3. Navigate to the repository files, locate or create the LICENSE file.
4. Edit or add the LICENSE file with MIT license text and commit to the default branch (main/master).
For now, the next immediate step is to fill the filter box with "dotfiles" to locate the repository quickly.
