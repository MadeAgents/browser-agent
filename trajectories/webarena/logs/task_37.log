The user wants to check driving time from the Gates Building at CMU to a police station in Pittsburgh using the OpenStreetMap site. The page shows the global OSM interface with a Search textbox focused and a "Go" button. The first step is to locate the starting point: Gates Center for Computer Science (often referred to as Gates Building) at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Using the search bar is the recommended approach per the tips. I will enter "Gates Center for Computer Science, Pittsburgh, PA" into the Search field (bid 162). After this, I will click Go in a subsequent step to get the search results, then proceed to directions to a police station in Pittsburgh and compute driving time. For now, only one action is allowed, so I will fill the search box.

✅ Current Progress: Entered the origin location “Gates Center for Computer Science, Pittsburgh, PA” into the Search field.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap, which is suitable for checking driving directions and travel time—on the critical path toward the goal. Relevant interactive elements:
- Textbox labeled “Search” (id/index [162]): value is “Gates Center for Computer Science, Pittsburgh, PA”; currently focused; visible.
- Button “Go” (id/index [165]): visible; expected to execute the search.
- Link “Find directions between two points” (id/index [167]): visible; expected to open the directions interface to set origin/destination and select travel mode (car).
- Optional: “Close” button (id/index [217]) for the welcome panel, visible.

No deviation detected; the next logical step is to submit the search, then use the directions interface to set the destination (a Pittsburgh police station) and check car travel time.

The user wants to check whether a police station in Pittsburgh can be reached within one hour by car from the Gates Building at CMU. We're on OpenStreetMap with the search box already filled with "Gates Center for Computer Science, Pittsburgh, PA" (this will serve as the origin). According to the task tips, to find routes A to B, we should use the directions control (the "two arrow" button), which here is represented by the link "Find directions between two points" [167].

The best next step is to open the directions interface so I can set the origin to the Gates Center and the destination to a police station in Pittsburgh (e.g., "police station, Pittsburgh, PA"), and then compute driving time. So I will click the directions link [167] to bring up the origin/destination fields.

I avoid clicking "Go" on the search because that would search for the origin place rather than set up directions. I also don't need to close the welcome panel since it is not blocking interaction. After the directions UI opens, I will fill in the From and To fields appropriately and then request a car route to check if the travel time is within one hour.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button “Reverse Directions” ([200]) to set “From” = Gates and clear “To”.

Goal: Determine if a police station in Pittsburgh can be reached within one hour by car from the Gates Building (Gates Center for Computer Science at CMU) using the OpenStreetMap directions tool.

Current page state: The OSM Directions panel is open. Travel mode is set to "Car" (radio [173] checked). The routing service is OSRM ([182]). The "To" field ([199]) is already filled with "Gates Center for Computer Science, Randy Pausch Memorial Bridge, ... Pittsburgh, ... 15213, United States". The "From" field ([194]) is empty. There is a "Reverse Directions" button ([200]) that will swap the values between "From" and "To".

Plan: Since the "To" field contains the origin (Gates), I should first click "Reverse Directions" so that "From" becomes the Gates Center and "To" becomes empty. Then I can enter a destination like "police station, Pittsburgh, PA" in the "To" field to compute a car route and check the travel time. Only one action is permitted per step, so the next best action is to click the "Reverse Directions" button ([200]).

The user wants to know whether a police station in Pittsburgh can be reached within one hour by car from the Gates Building at CMU. The OpenStreetMap directions panel already shows a computed car route using OSRM. The “From” field is set to “5000, Forbes Avenue, Squirrel Hill North, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15213, United States” (CMU/Gates area), and the “To” field is set to “Zone One Police Station, Jacksonia Street, California-Kirkbride, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15290, United States.” The route summary shows Distance: 9.5km and Time: 0:12. Since 12 minutes is well within 1 hour, we can confidently answer “Yes” and provide the measured time and distance. The best next action is to send this result to the user concisely, including yes/no, time, and distance with proper formatting.
