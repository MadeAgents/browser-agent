The user needs the number of commits of the top contributor to the main branch. On GitLab, this is found in the Repository section under the "Contributors" tab, where contributors are listed with commit counts and typically a branch filter (often defaulting to the main/master branch). The current page is the project repository root showing files and a branch selector displaying "master". To get to the contributors list, I should navigate via the "Repository" link in the sidebar to access its submenus, including "Contributors". From there, I can check the commit counts. The first step is to click the "Repository" link to expose or navigate to the subpages like "Contributors".

✅ Current Progress: No progress made yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: You are on the repository Files view for branch “master” of “awesome-python” on GitLab. This page is related but not the page that lists contributors and their commit counts. Relevant interactive elements visible:
- Sidebar “Repository” section with link “Contributors” (id [315], visible, clickable).
- Sidebar “Branches” link (id [309], visible, clickable).
- Branch selector button labeled “master” (id [525], hasPopup menu, expanded=False), which can be used to switch branches if “main” exists.
The goal requires commit counts for the “main” branch; currently the branch selector indicates “master,” so you’ll need to either switch to “main” (if available) or verify via the “Branches” page.

The user asks for the number of commits of the contributor with the most commits to branch "main". On GitLab, this information is found under the Repository’s "Contributors" tab, which lists contributors and their commit counts, typically scoped to the default branch (here the branch selector shows "master"; per the tips, "main" often means "master"). The current page is the Files view with the sidebar showing a "Contributors" link (bid 315). My previous attempt to click the "Repository" link (bid 295) timed out without navigation, so to avoid redundant or ineffective actions, I will click the "Contributors" link directly to reach the page that lists commit counts.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “Contributors” page. Viewing contributor commit counts for branch “master.”

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path for the goal but currently shows data for “master,” not “main.” Relevant interactive elements:
- Button labeled “master” (id [498], visible, clickable) — controls branch selection for the contributors view.
- Heading “Commits to master” (id [518], visible) — confirms the current branch context.
- Sidebar “Branches” link (id [302], visible, clickable) — can be used to verify whether a “main” branch exists and switch if needed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the branch selector button labeled “master” (id [498]) and switch to branch “main.”
- If “main” is not available, click the “Branches” link (id [302]) to check for a “main” branch and navigate accordingly.

The user asks for the number of commits of the top contributor to branch "main". I’m on the project’s Contributors page, which currently shows “Commits to master” and a branch selector button labeled “master” (bid 498). The list already displays commit counts, with “Vinta Chen” showing 414 commits, which appears to be the highest on this page. However, to ensure accuracy for “main,” I should check whether a “main” branch exists and switch to it if available. The next step is to click the “master” branch selector to open the dropdown and look for “main.” If “main” is not present, per the tips, “main” often maps to “master,” in which case 414 would be the answer. I will click the branch selector now to proceed.
