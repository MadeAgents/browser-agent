The user wants to browse products in the Men shoes category. According to the site tips, I should navigate via dropdown menus rather than search. On the current page, there's a vertical navigation menu with an item "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry" (menuitem with hasPopup='menu', bid 656). To reach "Men shoes," I should first hover over "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry" to reveal its subcategories, likely including "Men" and then "Shoes." The next best step is to hover on this menu item to open the submenu.
