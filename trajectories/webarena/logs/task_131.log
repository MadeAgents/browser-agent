The user asks for the total number of items sold in the most recent 7 orders. To get this, I should navigate to the Sales > Orders page, then sort the orders by Purchase Date in descending order (as required by the benchmark tip #11), and then take the first 7 orders from the list. I’ll sum the “Items” counts for those 7 orders using the calculate() function. Right now I'm on the Dashboard. The top navigation bar shows a "SALES" link (node [156]).

The goal is to find the total number of items sold in the most recent 7 orders. To achieve this, I need to navigate to the Sales > Orders page where the orders grid is available. From there, I must sort by Purchase Date in descending order (as required by the benchmark rule) to ensure I’m looking at the most recent orders, then capture the “Items” count for the first 7 rows and sum them using the calculate() function.

- button 'Columns' [760] — visible and enabled; the Items count is not currently visible in the grid, so this control is relevant to adjust visible columns if an Items column exists.
- table [1370] with rows [1411…] — visible; represents the orders to read once sorted correctly.
- pagination: spinbutton 'of 2' [1136] value=1 (page 1), next page button [1138] visible; textbox 'per page' [1106] value='200' (shows up to 200 orders per page).

The user asks for the total number of items sold in the most recent 7 orders. Per the task tips, I must ensure the orders are sorted in descending order by Purchase Date at least once before selecting the most recent orders. The Orders grid is visible and currently shows "↑ Purchase Date" in the header, which may indicate a sort state, but to satisfy the requirement explicitly, I should perform a sort action on the Purchase Date column.

After sorting, I will later need to make sure I can see the number of items for each order. The current grid columns (ID, Purchase Point, Purchase Date, Bill-to Name, Ship-to Name, Grand Total, Status, Action, etc.) do not include an Items or Purchased Items column. I will likely need to open the Columns menu to add the Purchased Items column. However, only one action is allowed per step. The best immediate next step is to click the Purchase Date column header to (a) perform the required sort action and (b) observe whether it results in descending order. If it ends up in ascending order, I can click again in the following step to set it to descending. Then I can proceed to expose the Items column via the Columns button.

The user's goal is to find the total number of items sold in the most recent 7 orders. Per the important tip #11, I must ensure the orders are sorted in descending order by Purchase Date at least once, to get the most recent orders at the top of page 1 without changing per-page limits.

Currently, the Orders grid shows "↓ Purchase Date" but the visible top rows are from early January 2022 progressing forward (Jan 8, 2022, Jan 9, 2022, Jan 11, 2022, etc.), which indicates the grid is actually sorted in ascending order by date. Therefore, I need to toggle the sort on Purchase Date again to ensure it is truly descending (latest first). Once the list is in the correct order, I can then proceed to reveal the items count column (via Columns) and sum the counts for the first 7 orders.

Given only one action is allowed per step, the next best action is to click the "Purchase Date" column header again to switch the order to descending.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click columnheader '↑ Purchase Date' [1392] to switch to descending order (most recent first).
- Then click button 'Columns' [760] to enable the column that displays item counts (e.g., “Purchased Items”), so you can read and sum the first 7 rows.

Task: Find the total number of items sold in the most recent 7 orders.
Constraints and tips: Must sort by Purchase Date in descending order at least once (Tip #11), and do not change per-page limit. If needed, open orders to get item counts and sum using calculate().

Current page: Sales > Orders grid is open. I have already clicked the Purchase Date header twice earlier, satisfying the requirement to perform a sort operation.

The Columns panel is open, but there is no visible “Items” column to enable among the listed checkboxes. To obtain item counts, the practical approach is to open each of the top 7 orders via their “View” links and read the quantity of items ordered on the order details page, then sum them.

Plan:
1) Open the first order (top row) via its “View” link to capture the number of items.
2) Repeat for the next 6 orders and accumulate counts with calculate().
3) Report the total.

Next best action: Click the “View” link of the first row (Order 000000299) [1436] to access its details and retrieve the items count.

  - button “Columns” [760] — visible; columns panel open; shows “11 out of 22 visible”.
  - Column checkboxes: 
    - Checked: “ID” [766], “Purchase Point” [769], “Purchase Date” [772], “Bill-to Name” [775], “Ship-to Name” [778], “Grand Total (Base)” [781], “Grand Total (Purchased)” [784], “Status” [787], “Action” [820], “Allocated sources” [823], “Braintree Transaction Source” [829].
    - Unchecked examples: “Subtotal” [805], “Shipping and Handling” [808], “Customer Name” [811], “Payment Method” [814], “Total Refunded” [817], etc.
    - No Items/Purchased Items option is visible/enabled, so the grid does not display item counts.
  - column header “Purchase Date” [1392] — clickable for sorting; sort action has been performed to get most recent orders first.
  - Row “View” links (e.g., first-row “View” [1436]) — used to open order details where item quantities can be read.
- Approach remains on track: open the top seven recent orders (after confirming descending by Purchase Date) and sum the quantities from each order’s details.

The user's question is to compute the total number of items sold in the most recent 7 orders. According to the benchmark tip #11, I must ensure the orders are sorted by Purchase Date in descending order at least once and then use the first 7 orders without changing the per-page limit. I've already clicked the Purchase Date header twice earlier, and the visible top rows show dates in late May 2023, which indicates the list is currently in descending order (newest first). 

I tried to open the first order's "View" link (bid 1436) to get item counts from the order detail page. However, the click failed because the Columns panel overlay is still open and intercepting pointer events (the label "Shipping and Handling" from the Columns overlay is blocking the click). To proceed, I need to close the Columns panel. The simplest way is to toggle the Columns button (bid 760) to hide the overlay. After closing it, I can click the "View" link for the first order and then proceed to gather item counts for the 7 most recent orders, using take_note to track them and calculate() to sum them at the end.

Therefore, the immediate next action is to click the Columns button to close the overlay.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Sales > Orders; orders grid is visible.
- Performed sort action on “Purchase Date” at least once.
- Opened and then closed the Columns panel (no Items/Purchased Items column available).
- Attempted to open the first order’s “View” link but was blocked by the Columns overlay (now closed). No item counts collected yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The Orders grid page is on the critical path to the goal.
- The grid currently shows columnheader “↑ Purchase Date” [1392], indicating ascending sort (oldest first). This is not aligned with “most recent 7 orders.”
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - columnheader “Purchase Date” [1392] — clickable; currently sorted ascending (“↑”).
  - button “Columns” [760] — visible; overlay closed.
  - “per page” textbox [1106] — value=200; should not be changed per instructions.
  - pagination next button [1138] — visible; not needed if descending sort shows newest on page 1.
  - “View” links in the Action column (e.g., first-row “View” [1436]) — enabled; used to open order details to read item counts.
- To proceed, ensure descending sort (newest first), then open the top 7 orders and sum their item counts.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the “Purchase Date” column header [1392] to toggle to descending order (newest first).
- Then click the first row’s “View” link [1436] to begin collecting item counts from the most recent orders.

Goal: Compute the total number of items sold in the most recent 7 orders. We are currently on the order detail page for Order #000000299. The Items Ordered section shows 5 line items, each with "Ordered 1". Therefore, this order has 5 purchased items. To systematically aggregate across 7 orders, I should record this intermediate count, then go back to the Orders grid to open the next orders (298, 297, etc.), repeating the process for a total of 7 orders.

Objective: Find the total number of items sold in the most recent 7 orders. Benchmark rule #11 requires sorting by Purchase Date in descending order at least once and retrieving the most recent k orders without changing the per-page limit. I already sorted earlier and confirmed the top rows show late May 2023 dates, which indicates the list is currently in descending order. I counted the first order (#000000299) as 5 items and saved that note. 

Next steps: Open the next six most recent orders in sequence from the grid and record their item counts from each order’s details page, then sum them with calculate(). I’m back on the Orders grid. The second row corresponds to the next most recent order (ID 000000065, May 28, 2023). I should click its “View” link to open the order details and read item quantities. There is no overlay blocking now (the Columns panel was closed earlier), so the “View” link for the second row (bid 1473) should work.

Plan:

- Repeat for the next orders until 7 counts are collected.

- Relevant interactive elements for progressing:
  - Column header “Purchase Date” [1392] (visible, clickable). Sorting operation already performed; list shows most recent first.
  - Orders table [1370] with rows containing “View” links in the Action column (e.g., first-row “View” [1436], second-row “View” [1473]; subsequent rows have analogous “View” links). These are needed to open each order’s details and read item quantities.
  - “Columns” button [760] (visible, closed now) – not needed further since item counts are being obtained from order detail pages.
  - Pagination controls: “per page” textbox [1106] value=200 (do not change), page spinner [1136] value=1, “Next page” [1138] enabled. Not needed unless the top 7 span multiple pages (unlikely with current sort).
- Next required work on this page: Open the next five most recent orders via their “View” links, record each order’s item counts from the Items Ordered section, and sum to reach the total for 7 orders.

We need the total number of items sold in the most recent 7 orders. I already ensured the Orders grid was sorted by Purchase Date in descending order (requirement #11). I’ve opened the top orders sequentially and recorded counts so far:
- #000000299: 5 items
- #000000065: 4 items

I clicked into the next most recent order, #000000136. On this order’s detail page, in the “Items Ordered” section, I see four product rows, each with “Ordered 1,” indicating 4 items total for this order. To keep a reliable running total across pages, I should record this count before navigating back to the orders list for the next orders. Thus, I will add a note: “Order #000000136 purchased items: 4”. After this, I will go back to the Orders grid and proceed to open the next three most recent orders to gather their item counts and eventually sum all seven using calculate().

We need the total number of items sold in the most recent 7 orders. I already ensured the Orders grid was sorted by Purchase Date in descending order (requirement #11). I’ve opened the top orders sequentially and recorded counts so far:
- #000000299: 5 items
- #000000065: 4 items
- #000000125: 3 items

I clicked into the next most recent order, #000000136. On this order’s detail page, in the “Items Ordered” section, I see four product rows, each with “Ordered 1,” indicating 4 items total for this order. To keep a reliable running total across pages, I should record this count before navigating back to the orders list for the next orders. Thus, I will add a note: “Order #000000136 purchased items: 4”. After this, I will go back to the Orders grid and proceed to open the next three most recent orders to gather their item counts and eventually sum all seven using calculate().

Objective: Find the total number of items sold in the most recent 7 orders. I've already ensured the Orders grid was sorted by Purchase Date in descending order (per Tip #11) and collected item counts for the first 4 most recent orders:
- #000000299: 5 items
- #000000065: 4 items
- #000000125: 3 items
- #000000136: 4 items
Total so far: 16 items across 4 orders. I am currently on the Order View page for #000000136. To proceed, I need to go back to the Orders grid to open the next most recent orders and record their item counts. The Back button [741] will return me to the Orders grid. This is the most logical next step given only one action is allowed at a time.

- Relevant elements (visible/enabled):
  - Column header “Purchase Date” [1392] — sorted; confirms we’re viewing most recent orders first (requirement satisfied).
  - Orders table [1370] with rows of recent orders.
  - “View” links in the Action column for each row — used to open order details and read item counts. Already used: first four rows’ “View” links [1436], [1473], [1510], [1547].
  - Per-page selector [1106] shows 200 (do not change per instructions).
  - Pagination controls [1135] prev (disabled) and [1138] next (not needed since the top 7 are on page 1).
- Note: The grid does not display an “Items” column; item counts are correctly being gathered from each order’s detail page under the “Items Ordered” section.

We need the total number of items sold in the most recent 7 orders. Per rule #11, I already sorted by Purchase Date in descending order earlier, and confirmed the newest orders (late May 2023) are at the top. I’ve opened and recorded item counts for the first four orders:
- #000000299: 5 items
- #000000065: 4 items
- #000000125: 3 items
- #000000136: 4 items

Back on the Orders grid, the next three most recent orders (5th–7th) are:
- 5th: #000000230 (May 19, 2023) with “View” link bid 1584
- 6th: #000000242 (May 15, 2023) with “View” link bid 1621
- 7th: #000000025 (May 14, 2023) with “View” link bid 1658

To continue, I’ll open the 5th most recent order (#000000230) to read the Items Ordered counts, then I’ll record them and proceed similarly for the next two.
