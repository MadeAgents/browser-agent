The user wants to see the most recent processing order page. According to the task tips, order history is accessible via My Account > My Orders. From there, I should identify orders with status "processing" and open the most recent one. On the current homepage, I see a "My Account" link in the header (bid 227). The first step is to click "My Account" to navigate to the account dashboard where "My Orders" should be available. I will then proceed to My Orders and filter/sort to find processing orders.

The pagination control provides a “Page 2” link with bid 1606. Clicking it will load the next set of orders where I can look for a “Processing” status and then open its “View Order” page.

    - Row example: Order 000000163 — Status: Complete — “View Order” link [1502] (visible, enabled).
    - Row example: Order 000000154 — Status: Complete — “View Order” link [1513] (visible, enabled).
  - Pagination controls are available and enabled:
    - “Page 1” link [1573], “Page 3” link [1614], “Page 4” link [1618].
- Current page (Page 2) shows only “Complete” statuses; no “Processing” status is visible here. Continue scanning remaining pages and open the first row whose Status = “Processing” via its “View Order” link.

The goal is to open the page for the most recent order with Status = “Processing.” I’m on the “My Orders” list, currently on Page 2 (confirmed by the pagination showing “You’re currently reading page 2”). The table rows on this page all display Status = “Complete,” so there’s no processing order here.

The user wants me to show the most recent processing order page. I’m on the “My Orders” page, currently on Page 4 (URL includes ?p=4), which shows the oldest orders (Items 31–37 of 37). I carefully reviewed the rows listed on this page via the accessibility tree: the statuses are Canceled or Complete for all orders here (e.g., 000000182: Canceled; 000000181: Complete; 000000168: Complete; etc.). 

From my previous navigation through Pages 1, 2, and 3, I also observed that none of those pages had any orders marked “Processing”; they showed statuses like Complete, Canceled, or Pending. Therefore, across all available order history pages (1–4), there are no orders with status “Processing.”

Since the goal is to show the most recent processing order page, and there doesn’t appear to be any processing orders to open, the best next step is to inform the user of this finding and ask how they’d like to proceed (e.g., open the most recent order regardless of status or the most recent pending order). I'll communicate this clearly using send_msg_to_user.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to “My Orders” and reviewed the full order history via pagination (Pages 1–4; 37 total items).
- Confirmed that no orders have Status = “Processing” across all pages.
- Currently viewing Page 4 (Items 31–37).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The “My Orders” page is on the critical path for the goal.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Orders table “Orders” [1474] with column headers: “Order #” [1478], “Date” [1479], “Order Total” [1480], “Status” [1481], “Action” [1482].
  - Per-row action links “View Order” (e.g., [1491], [1502], [1513]) — all visible and enabled.
  - Pagination controls: “Page 1” [1573], “Page 2” [1606], “Page 3” [1614], “Page 4” [1618] (current).
- Observed examples on current page:
  - Order #000000182 [1485] — Status: Canceled [1489].
  - Order #000000181 [1496] — Status: Complete [1500].
  - Order #000000168 [1507] — Status: Complete [1511].
- Conclusion: The page is correct, but there is no “Processing” order available to open; the goal cannot be completed as specified with current data.
