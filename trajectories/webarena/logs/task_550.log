The user's goal is to add a new size "XXS" to the blue and purple variants of the product "Nona Fitness Tank". In Magento, this typically involves two main steps:
1) Ensure the Size attribute has the value "XXS" (if not, add it via STORES > Attributes > Product > Size).
2) Update the configurable product "Nona Fitness Tank" to include the new size in its configurations, but only for the blue and purple colors.

Given the current page is the Magento Admin Dashboard, the first practical step is to navigate to the product list so I can locate "Nona Fitness Tank". From the top navigation, the "CATALOG" menu item is visible with bid 189. The best next action is to click "CATALOG" to access products. Once in CATALOG > Products, I will use the search to find "Nona Fitness Tank", verify if it's a configurable product, then proceed with "Edit Configurations". If "XXS" is not available, I will then pivot to STORES > Attributes > Product to add "XXS" to the Size attribute before returning to the product configurations.

So, the immediate action is to click the CATALOG link.

The user's goal is to add size "XXS" to the blue and purple variants of the "Nona Fitness Tank". To do this in Magento:
1) Find and edit the configurable product "Nona Fitness Tank" in Catalog > Products.
2) Use "Edit Configurations" to add the XXS size to specific colors (Blue and Purple). If "XXS" does not exist in the Size attribute, add it via Stores > Attributes > Product > Size, then return to the product and update configurations.

I am already on Catalog > Products with a large list displayed. Since scrolling is not supported and the grid is very long, the most efficient step is to use the search box to filter to the specific product. The accessibility tree shows a "Search by keyword" textbox with bid 1392 and a "Search" button 1393. The product does appear somewhere in the list, but it’s safer to use search to bring it to top and ensure it’s visible.

Next step: enter "Nona Fitness Tank" in the "Search by keyword" textbox to filter the grid.

The task is to add a new size XXS specifically for the Blue and Purple variants of the configurable product "Nona Fitness Tank". I am already on the product edit page for this configurable product, and I can see the "Configurations" section, which includes an "Edit Configurations" button. This is the correct entry point for adding or generating new variant combinations in Magento. The Size attribute already appears to include "XXS" (as seen in the disabled Size dropdown listing "XXS"), so I likely won't need to add a new attribute value via Stores > Attributes.

Plan:
1) Click "Edit Configurations" to open the configuration wizard.
2) In the wizard, keep attributes (Size, Color) as they are and proceed.
3) In the attribute values step, select Color: Blue and Purple; Size: XXS only.
4) Continue through the steps (images/price/quantity as needed) and generate the two configurations.
5) Save the product to finalize the changes.

The user's goal is to add a new size XXS for the Blue and Purple variants of the Nona Fitness Tank configurable product. I’m currently in the “Create Product Configurations” wizard at Step 2: Attribute Values. The Size attribute shows multiple selected values (XS, S, M, L, XL), and XXS is present. To ensure we only generate the needed new variants (XXS for Blue and Purple), I should leave selected: Size = XXS only; Color = Blue and Purple only. That means I must deselect XS, S, M, L, XL and uncheck Red in Color. Since I already clicked the XXS checkbox in the previous step and I cannot confirm if it remained selected (it might have toggled), the safest next action is to start deselecting the extra sizes, beginning with XS. After deselecting all other sizes and Red, I will click Next to proceed.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened “Nona Fitness Tank” (configurable) and launched the Create Product Configurations wizard.

The task is to add the new size XXS for the Blue and Purple variants of the Nona Fitness Tank. I’m currently in the Create Product Configurations wizard at Step 2: Attribute Values. I’ve already adjusted the Size selections so that only XXS is selected, and I need to ensure that the Color selections include only Blue and Purple. The Color list shows Blue and Purple selected, but Red is also selected, which would generate an unwanted configuration. To limit configurations to Blue and Purple only, I should deselect Red. After that, I can proceed to the next step to generate the configurations. Since only one action is allowed now, I will deselect the Red checkbox.
