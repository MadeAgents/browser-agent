The user needs a bulk price update for a subset of products defined by attributes: color = blue, size = XS and S, product type/category = running t-shirts. In Magento Admin, the most efficient path is to use CATALOG > Products, apply filters for attributes (Color, Size, Category or possibly Activity "Running" and Type "T-shirt"), select the filtered items, and use the mass action "Update Attributes" to adjust the price. On this dashboard page, the primary navigation includes CATALOG. The next step is to click CATALOG to access the products grid where I can apply filters and perform the bulk update.

I will click on the CATALOG menu item to navigate to the Products section.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is the Dashboard with the Catalog menu expanded—this is on the path but not yet the Products grid where bulk updates can be executed. Relevant interactive elements:
- link 'Products' (id: 201) — visible, enabled; needed to access the product grid for filtering and mass actions.
- link 'Categories' (id: 204) — visible, enabled; not required for this task.
- link 'CATALOG' (id: 189) — focused/open, confirming the menu is expanded.

To proceed toward the goal (increase prices of blue running t-shirts in XS and S by 23%), navigate to Products (201) to apply attribute filters and perform a bulk update.

The user wants to increase prices for a subset of products defined by attributes: color = blue, product type = running t-shirts, sizes = XS and S, by 23%. The correct workflow in Magento Admin is:
1) Navigate to Catalog > Products to open the product grid.
2) Use filters to narrow down products to "running t-shirts" with color Blue and sizes XS and S. Filters might include Category (e.g., Tees or T-shirts), possibly an attribute like "Activity" = Running, Color = Blue, and Size = XS or S. We'll inspect available filters on the grid.
3) Select all filtered products and use Actions > Update Attributes.
4) In the mass attribute update form, locate the price change section (often "Change Price Using") and choose "Increase by Percentage" and enter 23 (or similar mechanism) and save.

Currently, we are on the Dashboard with the Catalog menu expanded, showing "Products" and "Categories". To proceed, we need to click "Products" to access the product grid. This is the next necessary step before applying filters and mass updating prices.

Therefore, I will click the "Products" link in the Catalog menu (bid 201).

✅ Current Progress: Reached the Catalog > Products grid in Magento Admin. No filtering for blue running t-shirts or price updates performed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the correct path (Products grid), but the current filter is off-target. An active keyword filter “Ingrid Running” limits results to irrelevant products (e.g., running jackets), not blue running t-shirts in XS/S.
- Active filter chip: listitem “Keyword: Ingrid Running” with remove button (id: 917), visible, enabled.
- Clear all filters button (id: 920), visible, enabled.
- Filters toggle button (id: 908 ‘Filters’), visible, enabled — required to set Color = Blue and Size = XS/S (and category/type for t-shirts).
- Search by keyword textbox (id: 1403) value='Ingrid Running', visible.

- Actions button for bulk updates (id: 1409), visible, enabled — to be used after correct filtering.
- Grid shows “16 records found,” indicating current results are constrained by the incorrect keyword filter.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button id=920 “Clear all” to remove the irrelevant keyword filter.
- Click button id=908 “Filters” to open the filter panel and then apply filters for Color=Blue and Size=XS and S (and restrict to t-shirts) before proceeding to mass update.

The goal is to bulk increase the price by 23% for all products that match: color = Blue, size = XS and S, and product type/category = running t-shirts. I'm on the Products grid, but there's currently an active keyword filter "Ingrid Running" restricting results to running jackets, which is irrelevant. To proceed efficiently, I should first clear all active filters to start fresh, then open the Filters panel to set the precise filters (Color = Blue, Size = XS and S, and category/attribute to target running t-shirts).

We need to bulk update prices for "blue running t-shirts" in XS and S sizes by +23%. The Products grid is open with Filters expanded. To efficiently isolate only the variant SKUs (child simples), I should filter:

The user wants a bulk price increase of 23% for a specific subset: blue running t‑shirts, sizes XS and S. I’m already on Catalog > Products with the grid filtered to Type: Simple Product (per the Active filters section). To proceed efficiently, I should further narrow results using Filters to target:
- Color = Blue
- Size = XS and S
- Product type/category indicating “running t‑shirts” (likely via Category or keyword like “Tee” if Category/Activity filters aren’t present)

The Filters panel likely collapsed after applying the Type filter. The next logical step is to open the Filters panel again to add these attribute filters. From there, I can refine the list and then use Actions > Update Attributes to apply a 23% price increase (assuming the mass update dialog supports percent adjustments).

So the immediate next action is to click the Filters button [908] to expand the filter options again.

- Set and applied filter Type = “Simple Product.”
- Reopened the Filters panel to add more filters.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The Products grid (Magento Admin > Catalog > Products) is the correct place to filter items and perform a bulk price update, so this is on the critical path to the goal.
- Active filters summary [909] shows “Type: Simple Product” with a remove button [9906]; “Clear all” button [920] is available.
- Filters panel is open via the Filters toggle [908].
- Relevant filter controls visible:
  - Name textbox [1010] (empty).
  - Type combobox [1015] (value: Simple Product).
  - Store View combobox [985] (value: All Store Views).
  - Numeric/date range groups for ID [925], Price [938], Quantity [951], Last Updated [964].
- The grid does not currently expose Color or Size filters in the filter panel. The Columns button [785 “Columns”] is available and can be used to show attribute columns (e.g., Color, Size) for in-grid filtering needed to isolate “blue” and sizes “XS” and “S” before performing the mass update.

Objective: Bulk-increase the price by 23% for all blue running t-shirts in sizes XS and S.

Current state: We are on Catalog > Products with the grid open. Active filter is Type: Simple Product, which isolates variant SKUs. The Filters panel is open. The filter fields visible include Name, Type, Attribute Set, SKU, etc., but Color and Size are not explicitly present in this panel. However, variant names include color and size in their names (e.g., “Minerva LumaTech™ V-Tee-XS-Blue”), so filtering by Name can effectively constrain to tees and to specific color/size patterns.

Plan:
1. Use Filters > Name to target t-shirts by entering “Tee” (common to t-shirt product names).
2. Apply filters.
3. Further refine using the “Search by keyword” box with “XS-Blue” (then repeat for “S-Blue”) to isolate blue variants for the target sizes.
4. Select all filtered results.
5. Use Actions > Update Attributes to apply a 23% price increase.

Next step: Enter “Tee” into the Name filter field to narrow to t-shirt products before applying more granular size/color search.

The user wants to bulk increase prices for “blue running tshirts” in XS and S sizes by 23%. I’m on Catalog > Products with active filters “Name: Tee” and “Type: Simple Product,” showing 330 records that include many tee variants. To precisely target “running t-shirts” and “blue,” the fastest approach is to use the “Search by keyword” box to filter by a phrase that matches names like “Atomic Endurance Running Tee … Blue” and then manually select XS/S rows and perform the mass action. The grid shows multiple “Atomic Endurance Running Tee” variants (Crew-Neck and V-neck) across sizes, including XS-Blue. I will first narrow the list using the search keyword “Running Tee Blue.” After that, I can select XS and S blue variants and proceed to Actions > Update Attributes or Change Price if available.

To efficiently isolate the relevant “running t-shirts,” the best next step is to use the “Search by keyword” box to find products whose names include “Running Tee,” which will capture both “Atomic Endurance Running Tee (V-neck)” and “Atomic Endurance Running Tee (Crew-Neck)” variants. Once filtered to Running Tees, I can further narrow to blue and sizes XS/S, select them, and use Actions > Update Attributes to apply a 23% price increase. Since only a single action is allowed per step, I will first populate the keyword search with “Running Tee” to reduce the results significantly before proceeding with more precise selection and update.

- Cleared a prior over-restrictive keyword filter; product grid is populated (330 records found).
- Entered “Running Tee” into the “Search by keyword” field but have not executed the search yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The Products grid is the correct place to perform a bulk price update via mass actions; we are on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant interactive elements (visible/enabled):
  - Search by keyword textbox [1403]: value = “Running Tee”, focused; Search button [1404] is enabled.
  - Filters toggle [908]: visible to refine results; Active filters panel [909] shows:
    - Name: “Tee” with remove button [10516] (enabled).
    - Type: “Simple Product” with remove button [10521] (enabled).
    - “Clear all” button [920] (enabled).
  - Products grid/table [1749] with header selection checkbox [1754] (unchecked) for selecting all visible results.
  - Actions button [1409] (enabled) to initiate mass update (e.g., Update Attributes) after selecting the targeted products.
  - Columns button [785] (enabled) if additional attributes (e.g., Color/Size columns) need to be displayed for verification/selection.
- To reach the exact subset (blue, sizes XS and S), further narrowing is needed after applying the “Running Tee” keyword (e.g., by removing/adjusting filters or using Filters/Columns to identify color and size). No errors or off-track navigation detected.

Objective: Increase the price of all blue running t-shirts in XS and S by 23%. From the current Products grid, we have active filters: Keyword: “Running Tee”, Name: “Tee”, Type: “Simple Product”, resulting in 30 records. The grid shows relevant variants, including:
- V-neck XS-Blue and S-Blue already at $34.44 (28 * 1.23), so these are already updated.
- Crew-Neck XS-Blue (ID 496) and Crew-Neck S-Blue (ID 499) at $29.00, which need to be increased to 29 * 1.23 = 35.67.

To perform the update efficiently, I will isolate each target SKU using the keyword search, select it, and perform Actions > Update Attributes to set Price to 35.67. The first step is to narrow the grid to “Crew-Neck XS-Blue” using the Search by keyword field so I can select that row and proceed with the mass update.

Therefore, the next best action is to fill the “Search by keyword” box with “Crew-Neck XS-Blue”.

The goal is to increase prices by 23% for all blue running t-shirts in XS and S. We are on Catalog > Products with active filters: Keyword = “Running Tee”, Name = “Tee”, Type = “Simple Product”. The “Search by keyword” field currently contains “Crew-Neck XS-Blue” but hasn’t been applied yet.

The user wants to raise prices by 23% for all blue running t-shirts in XS and S. On the Products grid, we already have filters set to Name: "Tee" and Type: "Simple Product", which shows all tee variants including the Atomic Endurance Running Tee series. Among these, the targets include the crew‑neck blue variants:
- Atomic Endurance Running Tee (Crew-Neck)-XS-Blue (row group shows its checkbox with bid 26143)
- Atomic Endurance Running Tee (Crew-Neck)-S-Blue (another row nearby has a checkbox with bid 22863, which I will select next)

To proceed with a bulk action (Actions > Update Attributes), I need to select the relevant rows first. The best immediate step is to click the checkbox for the XS Blue crew-neck running tee (bid 26143). After that, I will select the S Blue variant and then use Actions to update attributes with the price increase.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Catalog > Products grid in Magento Admin.
- Applied filters: Type = “Simple Product” and Name = “Tee”.
- Cleared prior over-restrictive keyword filter; product list repopulated.
- Selected one product row in the grid (selection status shows 1 selected).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path for bulk price updates of specific product variants.
- Relevant interactive elements (from the page’s accessibility tree):
  - Filtering and search:
    - “Filters” toggle button [908] (visible/enabled) to refine by attributes.
    - Active filters list shows “Name: Tee” with remove button [10516] and “Type: Simple Product” with remove button [10521]; “Clear all” button [920] is available.
    - “Search by keyword” textbox [1403] (present; no active keyword filter listed) and “Search” button [1404] (enabled).
  - Grid and selection:
    - Products table [1749] with header select checkbox [1754] and columns including Name, Type, Price, Status, etc.
    - Grid status indicates “330 records found (1 selected)”; pagination controls show “per page” textbox [1439]=200, previous-page button [1468] disabled, next-page button [1471] enabled.
  - Bulk action:
    - “Actions” button [1409] (enabled) for mass operations such as Update Attributes.
- Gap to goal: The current selection and filters do not yet isolate only blue “Running Tee” variants in XS and S; a targeted subset still needs to be filtered/selected before applying a +23% price update.

The user wants to increase the price of all blue running t-shirts in extra small (XS) and small (S) by 23%. We are on Catalog > Products with filters Type: Simple Product and Name: Tee. The grid shows many tee variants. The selection indicator shows 1 selected, but reviewing the focused/selected row (bid 26143) indicates it belongs to "Atomic Endurance Running Tee (Crew-Neck)-S-Red" (a red variant), which is not part of the requested blue subset. Before applying any mass update, I must clear this incorrect selection to avoid changing the wrong product. The best immediate action is to click the selected checkbox (bid 26143) to deselect it. After deselecting, I can proceed to narrow down to "Atomic Endurance Running Tee ... -XS-Blue" and "-S-Blue" (and potentially V-neck variants, though they appear already updated), select the correct blue XS/S rows, and perform Actions > Update Attributes to adjust price by percentage or set the correct price.
