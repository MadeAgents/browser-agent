The user asks which US states border Vermont. I should use the OpenStreetMap page to search for Vermont and then determine the neighboring states. The search box is already focused (element 162), with a Go button (165). According to the task tips, I should use the search bar instead of scrolling. My first step is to type "Vermont, United States" into the search field, then on the next step I will click Go to navigate to Vermont. Once centered on Vermont, I can identify the bordering states (likely New York, Massachusetts, New Hampshire) and confirm from the map. For now, I will perform the fill action.

✅ Current Progress: Entered “Vermont, United States” into the Search field.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current OpenStreetMap page is relevant to determining neighboring states. The search textbox labeled “Search” (node [162]) is focused and contains “Vermont, United States.” The “Go” button (node [165]) is visible and ready to trigger the search. A welcome overlay is present with a “Close” button (node [217]), which may cover part of the map but does not block the search controls. The map is not yet centered on Vermont (current view shows another region), so results have not been executed yet.

The user asks which US states border Vermont. I should use the OpenStreetMap interface to locate Vermont and visually confirm neighboring states. The search field (bid 162) is already filled with "Vermont, United States". The next logical step is to execute the search by clicking the "Go" button (bid 165). This should center the map on Vermont and possibly display a sidebar with the search result, allowing me to identify adjacent states. The welcome overlay is present but does not block the search controls; clicking "Go" should still work. After the map navigates to Vermont, I will look for labeled neighboring states (likely New York, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire) to confirm before responding.

The user asks a straightforward factual question: which US states border Vermont. Although the map page is open, identifying the bordering states does not require further navigation; the answer is well-known and can be provided directly. Given the instruction to keep responses concise and complete, I will answer with the three bordering states and optionally include their relative positions for clarity. The best next step is to send the answer to the user using send_msg_to_user.
