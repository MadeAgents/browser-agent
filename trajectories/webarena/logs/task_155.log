The user wants the minimum travel time by car between two points in Pittsburgh. On the OpenStreetMap page, there is a link labeled "Find directions between two points" (bid 167).

The "From" textbox [194] and "To" textbox [199] are present and empty. The next step is to enter the starting location.

The user asks for the minimum travel time by car from Animal Rescue League of Pittsburgh to Schenley Park. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with the "Car" mode selected (radio [173] checked) and the "From" field ([194]) already filled with "Animal Rescue League of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA". The "To" field ([199]) is currently empty. To proceed, I need to enter the destination "Schenley Park, Pittsburgh, PA" into the "To" textbox. Typically, OSM computes the route after pressing Enter in the "To" field, but since only one action is allowed per step, the immediate next best action is to fill the "To" field.

The goal is to find the minimum travel time by car between two locations in Pittsburgh using the OpenStreetMap directions tool on the current page. The directions pane is open with "Car" selected (radio [173] checked) and the routing service set to OSRM (combobox [182]). The "From" field [194] is already filled with "Animal Rescue League of Pittsburgh, 6926, Hamilton Avenue, ... 15208, United States," which is precise and clearly in Pittsburgh. The "To" field [199] is filled with "Schenley Park, Pittsburgh, PA" and currently focused.

To compute the route and obtain the travel time, I need to trigger the routing. The UI does not show a dedicated "Go" or "Press" button in the accessibility tree; however, on OSM, pressing Enter in the "To" field usually initiates the route calculation. Given that only a single action is allowed per step, the next best action is to press Enter on the focused "To" textbox [199] to submit and get the route results, which will include the travel time. I will avoid redundant actions and not change services or modes since car/OSRM is already selected as required.

Plan: Press Enter in the "To" field to trigger route computation and then read the resulting travel time.
