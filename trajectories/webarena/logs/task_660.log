The user wants me to create an issue in the "dotfiles" repository with a specific title, assignee (Abishek), and due date. I'm currently on the Projects Dashboard, which lists many projects and includes a "Filter by name" searchbox (element [273]). The "dotfiles" repository is not currently visible in the list, so the most efficient way per the tips is to use the search/filter input rather than scrolling. 

Plan:
1. Use the "Filter by name" searchbox to find "dotfiles".
2. After the list filters and shows the "dotfiles" project, click it.
3. Navigate to the Issues section and create a new issue.
4. Fill title, set assignee to Abishek, set due date to July 18, 2033, and submit.

First step is to fill the filter input with "dotfiles".

The user requested to create a new issue in the dotfiles repository titled "add support for oh-my-zsh", assign it to Abishek, and set the due date to July 18, 2033. I navigated to the dotfiles project's Issues page. Examining the current issue list, I see an existing issue entry:
- Title: "add support for oh-my-zsh"
- It shows a due date "Jul 18, 2033"
- It is "Assigned to Abishek S"
- Created by Byte Blaze 1 day ago

This exactly matches the user's requested specs, indicating the issue already exists with the correct title, assignee, and due date. Creating another would be a duplicate. The best next step is to inform the user that the requested issue already exists and is properly configured, and ask if they want any changes.
