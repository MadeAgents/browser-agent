✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the My Account dashboard where the Recent Orders table is visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is directly relevant to the goal of finding the billing address for a specific order.
- Relevant elements:
  - Table: “Recent Orders” (table, node [1534]) — visible.
  - Link: “View All” (link, node [1530]) — visible/enabled; opens full order history if the target order isn’t in the recent list.
  - Per-row action links within the Recent Orders table: “View Order” (links with visible text “View Order”) — visible/enabled; use the one in the same row as Order # 000000178 (matches the requested 00178) to open the order details where the billing address is shown.
- Note: A “Default Billing Address” section (group, node [1505]) is present, but that is the account’s default address, not necessarily the billing address for order 00178.

The user wants the billing address for order number 00178. On the My Account dashboard, the Recent Orders list does not include 000000178.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is directly on the critical path to find the billing address for order 00178 (order numbers here include leading zeros, e.g., 000000178).
- Relevant elements:
  - Table: “Orders” [1474], visible, with rows of past orders.
  - Per-row action: “View Order” links (e.g., [1491] for row 000000170, [1502] for 000000189, [1513] for 000000188), visible/clickable. Use the “View Order” link in the row where Order # equals “000000178” to open its details and view the billing address.
- Note: The table indicates multiple pages (“Items 1 to 10 of 37 total” visible on the page). If 000000178 is not in the current 10 rows, pagination or per-page controls beneath the table likely need to be used to locate it.

The user wants the billing address for order number 00178, which corresponds to order 000000178 on this Magento site. I'm already on the "My Orders" page with a paginated table of orders showing 10 per page. The current page (Page 1) lists orders like 000000170, 000000189, 000000188, etc., but not 000000178. 

To find 000000178 efficiently without scrolling (as the environment does not support it), I should use the pagination controls to go to Page 2 via the "Page 2" link in the pagination component. This will load a new set of rows fully visible in the viewport. Once on Page 2, I can locate order 000000178 and click its "View Order" to open details and then extract the billing address.

Thus, the next best action is to click the "Page 2" link.
