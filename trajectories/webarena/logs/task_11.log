The user asks for the count of reviews mentioning the term "disappointed". In Magento, review management is typically under MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews, where we can filter reviews by content keywords. From the dashboard, I see the top navigation with a MARKETING tab (bid 226). The plan:
1) Click MARKETING to open its submenu.
2) Navigate to User Content > All Reviews.
3) Use the grid filters to search for "disappointed" in the Review Content field.
4) Read the results count from the grid (often displayed as a total number of records), which gives the number of reviews matching that term.
I will start by clicking MARKETING to reach the reviews area.

To find this, I should navigate to the reviews management area and filter the reviews by content containing the term "disappointed."

The user needs the total number of reviews that mention the term “disappointed.” We’re already on the Reviews grid page under Marketing > User Content > All Reviews. The grid displays filter inputs in the header row. To count matching reviews across the store, it’s best to filter the “Review” column by the keyword “disappointed,” then click Search and read the updated “records found” total. 

From the accessibility tree, the filter textbox for the “Review” column corresponds to bid 825 (the sequence shows 821 for Title, 823 for Nickname, and 825 for Review). Therefore, the next optimal action is to enter “disappointed” into the Review filter textbox. After that, I will click the Search button (bid 700) to apply the filter and read the resulting record count.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the Reviews grid in Magento Admin, entered “disappointed” in the Review column’s filter, and clicked Search.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the correct path to determine the count of reviews mentioning “disappointed.”
- Reviews grid [767] is visible; records indicator shows “6 records found” ([741] + static text).
- Filter inputs in the header row are present:
  - Review filter textbox [825] is visible and editable.
  - Title filter textbox [821] and Nickname filter textbox [823] are also visible.
- Search button [700] and Reset Filter button [703] are visible and enabled.
- The current grid shows 6 total reviews; several rows do not contain “disappointed,” indicating the Review filter may not have been applied correctly. At least two visible rows in the Review column include the term “disappointed,” so the unfiltered result suggests a filtering issue.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click “Reset Filter” button [703].
- Type “disappointed” into the Review filter textbox [825], then click the “Search” button [700]. After the grid refreshes, read the updated “records found” value near [741] and report that count.
