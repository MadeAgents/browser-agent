The user wants the number of fulfilled orders and the total amount spent over the past six months relative to 6/12/2023. To find this, I should navigate to their order history. The page shows a "My Account" link at the top ([227]). From there, I expect to find "My Orders" where I can view order statuses and amounts. I will click "My Account" first to access account options and then proceed to "My Orders" to gather the needed data, possibly applying date filters if available.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to and confirmed the “My Account” dashboard while signed in (Welcome, Emma Lopez is visible).

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward the goal because it shows order-related information.
- Relevant elements:
  - Sidebar link “My Orders” (visible). This should lead to the full order history needed to evaluate the last six months.
  - “Recent Orders” section/table (visible). Rows display columns for Order #, Date, Ship To, Order Total, Status, and Action with “View Order” links (visible). Current visible statuses in this table appear as “Pending,” which suggests these may not be fulfilled and may not cover the required six-month period.
  - Header “My Account” and “Sign Out” link indicate the session is authenticated.
- To compute “fulfilled orders” and total spend over the past six months (from 12/12/2022 to 06/12/2023), the agent will likely need the full orders list and possibly filters, which should be accessible via “My Orders.” No errors or off-track navigation detected.

The user asks for the count of fulfilled orders and the total amount spent over the past six months, with "today" being 6/12/2023. That six-month window is from 12/12/2022 through 6/12/2023. To answer accurately, I need the comprehensive order history including statuses and totals. On the current "My Account" page, there is a sidebar link labeled "My Orders" (bid 1551), which should lead to the full list of orders and potentially provide filters by date/status. The "Recent Orders" table currently visible shows pending orders dated in 2025, which are irrelevant for the requested timeframe. Therefore, the next best step is to click "My Orders" to access the detailed order list where I can identify fulfilled (likely "Complete") orders within 12/12/2022–6/12/2023 and sum their totals.

The user wants the number of fulfilled orders (interpreting “fulfilled” as status “Complete”) and the total amount spent over the past six months, with “today” being 6/12/2023. That window is 12/12/2022 through 6/12/2023 inclusive. I’m on “My Orders” page 3 (items 21–30). The visible rows include dates from 11/26/22 to 2/24/23. Within the target window on this page, the fulfilled (Complete) orders are dated: 2/9/23 ($185.32), 1/29/23 ($440.64), 1/16/23 ($132.24), 12/18/22 ($97.15), 12/14/22 ($20.49), 12/12/22 ($53.29). That’s 6 fulfilled orders totaling $929.13 from this page. To capture the full six-month window up to 6/12/23, I need to check newer orders (March–June 2023), which should be on page 2 (and possibly page 1). The pagination shows “Page 2” link [1498], which I should click next to proceed to newer orders and continue counting/summing.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to “My Orders” and paginated to page 2 (items 11–20 of 50). Previously identified one fulfilled order within the 12/12/2022–06/12/2023 window: Order dated 2/9/23 with total $185.32 (status “Complete”). No full six‑month count or total spend compiled yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is directly relevant to the goal.
- Orders table (“Orders” [1362]) is visible with columns: Order #, Date [1367], Order Total [1368], Status [1369], Action [1370].
- On page 2, several rows fall within the target window (Feb–Jun 2023). The Status column shows some “Complete” entries (e.g., dates visible for 3/1/23 and 2/26/23), and each row has a “View Order” link (visible text: “View Order”) in the Action column.
- Pagination controls are present and indicate “Items 11 to 20 of 50 total,” with numbered links (visible text: “1”, “2”, “3”, “4”, “5”); page “2” is the current selection. A “Page Previous” control [1490] is visible/enabled for navigating to newer orders (page 1), which likely contains April–June 2023 entries needed for the six‑month tally.
- All necessary interactive elements to progress (Orders table entries and pagination links) are visible and enabled. No off‑track indicators detected.

The task is to count fulfilled (“Complete”) orders and total spend over the past six months relative to 6/12/2023, i.e., from 12/12/2022 through 6/12/2023 inclusive. I’m on the My Orders page, currently on page 2 (items 11–20 of 50). Page 2 shows some orders from March and May 2023; I identified three “Complete” entries on this page (3/11/23, 3/10/23, 2/27/23). To ensure I capture all orders up to 6/12/23, I should check page 1 for April–June 2023 orders, as page 1 likely contains the most recent entries around June 2023.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to “My Orders.” Pagination used to visit pages 3 and 2; at least one fulfilled order within the target window was identified earlier (2/9/23, $185.32, status “Complete”). No final six‑month count or total spend compiled yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page (My Orders) is relevant, but the visible rows are not in the required timeframe.
- Goal window: 12/12/2022 through 06/12/2023 (based on “today” = 06/12/2023).
- Current table (“Orders” [1362]) shows recent entries dated 12/22/25, 12/18/25, etc., with Status “Pending,” which are outside the target window.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Orders table headers: Date [1367], Order Total [1368], Status [1369], Action [1370].
  - Row Action links: “View Order” [1379] (enabled/visible), “Reorder” [1381] (enabled/visible).
  - Pagination: link “1” [1494] is currently selected; links “2” [1498] and “3” [1502] are visible/enabled; “Previous” [1490] is visible/enabled.
- Assessment: On-track page, but currently on the wrong pagination page for the requested timeframe.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click pagination link “2” [1498] to view orders from early/mid‑2023, then identify rows with Status “Complete” within 12/12/2022–06/12/2023 and note their Order Totals.
- If additional orders from Dec 2022–Feb 2023 are needed, click pagination link “3” [1502] and include “Complete” orders from that range.

  - Row action links “View Order” (e.g., [1379], [1390], [1401]) are visible/enabled if deeper details are needed.
  - Pagination controls are visible/enabled: page “1” [1494], “2” [1498], “3” [1502], and “Previous” [1490].
- Assessment: On-track. Page 2 should contain additional orders dated within Mar–May 2023; these need to be checked for Status = “Complete” and their Order Totals added to the subtotal from page 3. Page 1 may contain the newest entries (including any June 2023 orders) and should be reviewed if needed to complete the six-month window.
