The user wants me to re-post the Bald Eagle image from the current f/pics page into the earthporn forum and include the note "from /f/pics". To re-post properly, I need the image URL, which is usually found on the post's detail page. Per the site tips, I should click the "comments" link rather than the title to avoid being redirected externally. On the current page, the Bald Eagle post is "Amazing shot of a Blue Jay pestering a Bald Eagle" with "192 comments". In the accessibility tree, that specific comments link is [201]. I'll click that to open the post details where I can find the image and then proceed to create a new submission in f/earthporn with the image URL in the Body and the note "from /f/pics", leaving the URL field empty as instructed.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the Bald Eagle post detail page in /f/pics. The image is visible, and the account appears logged in.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to obtain the image URL and re-post it to earthporn with the note “from /f/pics”.

The goal is to re-post the Bald Eagle image from this f/pics submission into the earthporn forum and include the exact note "from /f/pics" in the body. To include the image, I need its direct URL. On the current submission detail page, the embedded image appears as a clickable element: a link [142] wrapping the image [143]. Clicking this should navigate to the image’s source URL, which I can then use in the new submission body.

After obtaining the image URL, the workflow will be:
- Navigate to the earthporn forum (f/earthporn).
- Click Submit.
- Fill in the Title (best to reuse the original title for fidelity: "Amazing shot of a Blue Jay pestering a Bald Eagle").
- Put the image URL and the note "from /f/pics" in the Body, leaving the URL field empty, per site instructions.

First step now: click the image link to get its URL.

The user wants me to cross-post the Bald Eagle image from this current f/pics submission into the earthporn forum and include the exact note "from /f/pics" in the post body. According to the site tips, the correct workflow is: navigate to the target forum first, click Submit, fill out the form (title and body), and ensure all content including URLs is placed in the Body field; leave the URL field empty. I previously clicked the image to view it directly, but I did not capture the URL. Since I can include a URL in the body, I can use the short URL for this submission (visible in the sidebar: http://10.177.37.113:9999/110715) as the source reference and note "from /f/pics". The next step is to navigate to the earthporn forum page so I can initiate the submission process. The most efficient path is to directly go to the forum via URL, which avoids extra navigation and scrolling. Once there, I will click Submit, then fill the form with a suitable title (likely reusing the original title for fidelity) and include the short URL and the note "from /f/pics" in the Body. For now, I need to navigate to f/earthporn.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the EarthPorn submission form. The forum selector is already set to “EarthPorn”. No fields have been filled yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to completing the goal (creating a new post in EarthPorn).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Radio [120] “URL” — selected (checked=true), visible and enabled.
  - Radio [122] “Image” — not selected (checked=false), visible and enabled.
  - Textbox [128] (URL field) — currently empty, visible and enabled.
  - Textbox [138] “Title” (required) — empty, visible and enabled.
  - Textbox [143] “Body” — empty, visible and enabled; Markdown allowed (note “Markdown allowed.” present).
  - Combobox [379]/Textbox [380] “Forum” — set to “EarthPorn”, visible and enabled.
  - Button [396] “Create submission” — visible and enabled.
- Missing prerequisite: the direct image URL from the source /f/pics post is not captured, which is needed to re-post the image (either in the URL field or in the Body as a Markdown image/link along with the note “from /f/pics”).

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Navigate back to the source /f/pics post and copy the direct image URL, then return here. On this form: paste the image URL into Textbox [128] (URL), enter a suitable Title in Textbox [138], type “from /f/pics” in Textbox [143], and click Button [396] “Create submission”.

The goal is to cross-post the Bald Eagle image from f/pics into the EarthPorn forum and include the exact note "from /f/pics" in the Body. I am currently on the EarthPorn submission form with Title and Body empty. Per site tips, all content including URLs should go into the Body and the URL field should be left empty. To properly re-post the image, I need the source image URL from the original f/pics post. The fastest way to obtain it is to navigate to /f/pics, open the post’s comments (to avoid external redirects), and retrieve the image link or short URL displayed there, then come back to this form to paste it into the Body along with "from /f/pics". Therefore, the next step is to go to the pics forum.

The user wants me to re-post the Bald Eagle image from the current /f/pics page into the earthporn forum and include the exact note "from /f/pics". To include the image properly in the new submission’s Body, I need its URL. Per site tips, I should open the post detail by clicking the "comments" link rather than the title to avoid external redirects. On this page, the Bald Eagle post is "Amazing shot of a Blue Jay pestering a Bald Eagle" and has a "192 comments" link (bid 201).

The user wants me to re-post the Bald Eagle image to the EarthPorn forum and include the exact note "from /f/pics". I’m currently on the Create submission form for EarthPorn with the Title already filled as “Amazing shot of a Blue Jay pestering a Bald Eagle.” Per the site tips, I must place all content including URLs in the Body and leave the URL field empty. I previously accessed the original f/pics submission and noted its short URL (http://10.177.37.113:9999/110715), which I can include in the Body along with the note. The Body textbox is identified as [143], and it is currently empty. The best next step is to fill the Body with the source URL followed by the exact note "from /f/pics". After this, I can proceed to click Create submission.
