✅ Current Progress: Opened the Edit Review page for the product “Ana Running Short” and reviewed one approved entry (nickname “Pura”). This review is largely negative (mentions the shorts “started falling apart”) and does not provide clear positive reasons customers like the product.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page (Magento Admin > Edit Review) is on the critical path for extracting customer feedback about Ana Running Short.
- Relevant elements:
  - Product link: “Ana Running Short” (link [717]) — visible.
  - Status: combobox “Status *” (combobox [757]) — value “Approved”.
  - Nickname: “Nickname *” (textbox [767]) — value “Pura”.
  - Summary of Review: (textbox [772]) — “Wore these for a year and they started f” (truncated).
  - Review: (textbox [778]) — full text describes durability issues; only says “I do like them” without specific positives.
  - Navigation/actions: “Back” (button [687]), “Previous” (button [695]), “Save and Previous” (button [697]), “Save Review” (button [693]). There is no “Next” button on this page, so prior attempts to use “Next” were not applicable.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button “Back” (id [687]) to return to the reviews list and open another review for “Ana Running Short” to gather positive reasons.
- Alternatively, click button “Previous” (id [695]) to navigate to another review and extract any stated reasons customers like the product (e.g., comfort, fit, material).

Objective: Extract reasons why customers like "Ana Running Short."

Current page: Marketing > User Content > Reviews grid filtered for product "Ana Running Short" (3 records found). The rows show:
- ID 308 (Approved) with positive-looking title: "VERY LIGHTWEIGHT COMFY-GOOD SHOES" and "Review" same phrase, Nickname "Marita", Product "Ana Running Short", Action: Edit (bid 862).
- ID 307 and 309 have titles suggesting neutral/negative experiences.

To provide accurate reasons, I should open the clearly positive review (ID 308) to read the full review text rather than rely on the truncated grid entry. From there, I can extract exact phrases (e.g., "very lightweight," "comfy") and then, if needed, open others to see if any contain positive aspects. The immediate next step is to click the Edit link for review ID 308.
