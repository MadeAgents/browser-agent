The user wants me to invite Koushik to the "dotfiles" repository as a guest. According to the tips, I should navigate to the project and use the Project information > Members tab to invite. The current page is the GitLab Projects dashboard, showing a list of repositories under "Yours". The best way to quickly find the "dotfiles" repo is to use the "Filter by name" searchbox on this page (node [273]). I'll enter "dotfiles" there to narrow down the list. Once filtered, I can click into the "dotfiles" project, then navigate to Project information > Members, and use the "Invite members" button to add Koushik with Guest permissions. For now, the first step is to fill the filter field with "dotfiles".

The user's goal is to invite Koushik to the "dotfiles" repo as a Guest. I'm currently on the Project members page with the "Invite members" modal open. The "Username or email address" field is already filled with "Koushik", and a suggestions dropdown is visible. In the accessibility tree, there is a specific menu item for "Koushik Dutta koush" with bid 1041. To proceed, I should select this suggested user so that they are added to the invite list. The role combobox is already set to "Guest", which matches the user's requirement. After selecting the user, the subsequent step will be to click the "Invite" button to send the invitation. For now, the best single next action is to click the suggestion "Koushik Dutta koush".
