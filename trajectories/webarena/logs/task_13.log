The user asks for the number of reviews that mention the term "decent". In Magento, reviews can be accessed via MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews. That grid usually has filters per column and shows a total records count after filtering, which is perfect for getting a count. 

Current page is the Dashboard. I should navigate to MARKETING first, then click into All Reviews. From there, I can use the filter on the "Review" (or maybe "Title" and "Detail") column to search for the term "decent". After applying the filter, the grid will show something like "X records found". I must avoid scrolling, but typically the All Reviews page shows the count near the top without needing to scroll.

First step: click on the MARKETING menu item to open the Marketing section to access User Content > All Reviews.

The user wants the count of reviews mentioning the term "decent." According to the tips, all reviews are accessible via MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews, and from there I can apply filters to find mentions of a specific term. The current page is the Dashboard with the Marketing menu already expanded, showing "All Reviews" under User Content. The next logical step is to navigate to the All Reviews page by clicking the "All Reviews" link. Once on that page, I will look for the Filters interface to search for "decent" (likely in the Review or Title fields) and then use the resulting records count. For now, I will click "All Reviews" to proceed.

The user asks for the number of reviews mentioning the term "decent." We’re already on the Reviews grid page in Magento Admin, which shows a filter row below the column headers and a records count ("351 records found"). To get the count of reviews containing "decent," the best approach is to filter the "Review" column (the detail text) with the keyword and then press Search to update the results and the records count.

From the accessibility tree, the filter row has textboxes for Title ([821]), Nickname ([823]), and Review ([825]) followed by comboboxes for Visibility and Type, matching the column order. Therefore, I should first input "decent" into the Review filter textbox ([825]) and then click Search ([700]) in the next step to apply the filter and read the updated records count.

I will now fill the Review filter textbox ([825]) with "decent".
