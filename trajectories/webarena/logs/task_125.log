The user wants the price range for "teeth grinding mouth guard" products on One Stop Market. I'm already on the search results page showing many relevant products and their prices. To determine the overall minimum and maximum prices accurately (across all 4944 results, not just the first 12), the best approach is to sort the results by Price. Once sorted, I can check the first item (for min when ascending) and then toggle the sort direction to descending to get the max from the first item.

Goal: Determine the price range of teeth grinding mouth guards on One Stop Market.

Current page: Search results for "teeth grinding mouth guard" with "Health & Household" filter applied and sorted by Price. The visible results are largely unrelated (snacks, ear tools, etc.), so I need to refine to actual mouth guard items.

The page offers "Related search terms" links which are a quick way to narrow the results without scrolling. The most relevant is the link labeled "mouth night guard" [1401], which should directly lead to listings of night/mouth guards for teeth grinding.

In the left “Shopping Options” panel, there is a Category filter showing “Health & Household (38 item),” which is the most appropriate category for mouth guards. Clicking this will filter the results down to relevant items, making it feasible to identify the minimum and maximum prices. After applying the filter, I can then sort by price ascending/descending to read the min/max. The immediate next step is to click the “Health & Household” category link.

✅ Current Progress:
- Searched for “mouth night guard” and opened the search results page.
- Applied sorting by Price.
- Results appear narrowed to a manageable set (Items 1–12 of 38).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path to determine the price range.
- Key elements relevant to extracting min/max prices:
  - Sort control: combobox [1388] “Sort By” (value = “Price”, enabled/visible).
  - Sort direction: link [1392] “Set Ascending Direction” (enabled/visible), indicating the current order is likely Price descending (highest first).
  - Results count indicator: “Items 1–12 of 38” confirms a finite result set suitable for identifying extremes.
  - Search box: combobox [274] “Search” (value = “mouth night guard”, enabled); button [279] “Search” currently disabled (no immediate need to re-run).
- Implication for measuring range: With Price sorting active and likely descending, the first product’s price represents the current maximum; activating [1392] would switch to ascending to surface the minimum at the top.

The user needs the price range specifically for teeth grinding mouth guards on One Stop Market. The current results are for “mouth night guard,” filtered to Health & Household and sorted by Price, but many items shown aren’t mouth guards. To accurately determine the range, I should refine the query to “teeth grinding mouth guard” to get precise, relevant products. The search input [274] is visible and currently contains “mouth night guard.” The next best step is to replace it with “teeth grinding mouth guard,” then I can execute the search (via Enter or the Search button) and sort by price to read min/max.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the general path to the goal but results are overly broad (Items 1–12 of 10223) and include many unrelated products (e.g., furniture, electronics), which is off-target for “teeth grinding mouth guard.”

  - Related search terms section present with links (e.g., [1397] “night guard teeth”; others truncated), which could help refine, but the current query remains the primary issue.
- Because the query is concatenated and filters are not applied specifically to mouth guards, the current results are not reliable for deriving the correct mouth guard price range.

The user asks for the price range of teeth grinding mouth guards. I’m already on the search results page for “teeth grinding mouth guard,” showing 4944 items with visible prices on the first 12 results. To determine the overall minimum and maximum prices across all results (not just the first page), the best next step is to sort the results by Price using the “Sort By” combobox. This will allow me to then check the ordering (ascending/descending) and read the lowest or highest price from the first item. The “Sort By” control [1389] is currently set to “Relevance,” with an available option “Price,” so I will select “Price” to reorder the results by price.

The user wants the price range for “teeth grinding mouth guard” on One Stop Market. The current page shows search results for that query but includes many irrelevant items and shows an enormous total (4944), even though it’s already sorted by Price. To accurately determine the price range for actual mouth guards, I should narrow the results using the Category filter in the left “Shopping Options” panel. The “Health & Household (21 item)” link is likely to contain relevant mouth guard products and has a manageable count. By clicking this, I can filter to relevant products; then I can sort by price ascending/descending to read the min and max. The best immediate next step is to apply the “Health & Household” filter.

Objective: Determine the price range for teeth grinding mouth guards on One Stop Market.

Current context: I’m on the search results page for "teeth grinding mouth guard," with "Health & Household" applied and currently sorted by Price. The visible results include many irrelevant items (nutrition bars, ear tools), and the sidebar shows subcategories within Health & Household: Household Supplies (3), Health Care (5), Diet & Sports Nutrition (10). It's likely that actual mouth guards are categorized under Health Care. Narrowing to "Health Care (5 item)" should filter to a small, relevant set that likely contains the mouth guard products. Once filtered, I can confirm the items and then use the sort order to identify min/max prices.

Plan: Click the "Health Care (5 item)" filter link in the Shopping Options to refine the results specifically to Health Care, increasing the chances of seeing actual mouth guard products. After that, I can adjust sort direction if needed to read min/max prices.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is close to the goal but off-track: the 5 visible items under Health Care are not teeth-grinding mouth guards (they include ear-cleaning tools and candles). We cannot derive a valid mouth-guard price range from these results.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Related search terms (to refine to actual mouth guards):
    - link [1395]: “mouth guard” (visible, enabled)
    - link [1399]: “mouth night guard” (visible, enabled)

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link [1395] “mouth guard” to refine results to relevant mouth guard products.
- After the page updates, ensure sorting by price: select “Price” in combobox [1386] (and use link [1390] to set ascending for minimum, then descending for maximum if needed).
