The user wants the coordinates of the bus stop on the Carnegie Museum of Art side of the street near CMU. We'll use OpenStreetMap's search to navigate to the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, then identify the nearby bus stop on the same side of the street as the museum. The Search box is already focused (element 162). The first step is to search for "Carnegie Museum of Art" to center the map on the correct location in Pittsburgh. After that, we can use the map and possibly the "Query features" tool to find the bus stop node and read its coordinates. So the immediate next action is to fill the search field with "Carnegie Museum of Art Pittsburgh" and then we'll click Go.

The user needs the coordinates (DD format) of the bus stop on the Carnegie Museum of Art side of the street near CMU. We’re on OpenStreetMap already centered around the Carnegie Museum of Art with the Query features tool enabled. Clicking precisely on the bus stop icon via the canvas could be unreliable due to lack of a specific bid for the exact map point. A more reliable approach is to use the Search box to find the specific bus stop feature by name, which should return an object with coordinates in the left panel. The map labels show “Forbes Ave & S Craig St” and “Forbes Ave at Dithridge St”; both are valid candidate stops adjacent to the museum. I will search for “Forbes Ave & S Craig St bus stop Pittsburgh” to retrieve the bus stop feature near the museum on Forbes Ave, which is a common naming in OSM. After results appear, I can click the most relevant bus stop and then read its coordinates.

The user needs the coordinates (in decimal degrees) of the bus stop located on the Carnegie Museum of Art side of the street near CMU. We’re on the OpenStreetMap search page, already centered on the Carnegie Museum of Art with bus stop icons visible on Forbes Avenue. The "Query features" tool is active (the icon shows green in the screenshot), which allows clicking the map to list nearby features (including bus stops) and then view their details where coordinates are typically available. The previous search for a specific bus stop name returned “No results found,” so the best approach is to use Query features and click somewhere on the map near the museum to bring up the features list, then select the specific bus stop from that list.

To initiate this, I should click on the map canvas (one of the tiled image elements). Any tile within the visible area should trigger the Query features panel. I will click one of the map tile images (e.g., element 494), which should be within the central map area near the museum and bus stops. This will bring up the feature list, from which I can pick the correct bus stop in subsequent steps and obtain its coordinates.

My last attempt to click a map tile failed due to the header intercepting the click (I clicked too close to the top). To make future map clicks effective and to ensure the query results panel can appear unobstructed, the best next step is to close the search panel using the visible “Close” button (bid 209). After that, I can click precisely on the bus stop on the museum (south) side of Forbes Avenue and read its coordinates from the Query features panel.

✅ Current Progress:
- Map is already centered on Carnegie Museum of Art along Forbes Avenue (near CMU); nearby bus stop labels “Forbes Ave at Dithridge St” and “Forbes Ave & S Craig St” are visible.
- “Query features” tool was activated.
- Searches were attempted (no useful results); no bus stop feature has been opened yet for coordinates.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path to the goal; OSM map shows the target area with bus stop icons.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Query features [454]: Visible; appears active (green).
  - Map tiles/images [488–506], [519–526]: Visible, clickable; needed to select the bus stop feature.
  - Zoom In [434] / Zoom Out [436]: Visible, enabled; useful for precise clicking.
  - Search textbox [162] and Go button [165]: Visible; not required if using Query features.
  - Overlay panel “Welcome to OpenStreetMap!” with Close button [217]: Visible; may obstruct part of the map.
- No coordinates have been retrieved yet; next step is to query the specific bus stop node on the museum (south) side of Forbes Ave and read its coordinates.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button with label 'Close' (id [217]) to dismiss the Welcome overlay.
- With Query features [454] active, zoom in via 'Zoom In' [434] once or twice, then click on the map tile image near the “Forbes Ave & S Craig St” bus stop label (e.g., image [499]) to open the feature list; select the bus stop on the museum (south) side to view its coordinates.

The user wants the decimal degree coordinates of the bus stop on the Carnegie Museum of Art side (south side of Forbes Avenue) near CMU. The map is already centered at the Carnegie Museum of Art with visible bus stop icons labeled “Forbes Ave at Dithridge St” and “Forbes Ave & S Craig St.” The “Query features” tool is active, which is ideal for retrieving precise coordinates of map features when clicking on the map.

To identify the correct stop, I should click on the map near the south side of Forbes Avenue close to S Craig Street, as that is the CMU-adjacent end and on the museum side. Clicking a map tile will open the Query features panel listing features at that location, including the bus stop node, from which I can read coordinates. Among the map tile elements, the group [519–526] likely corresponds to the right (east) side near S Craig Street. I will click on one of these tiles, specifically [523], to bring up the features list for that area so I can then select the bus stop in the next step.

Objective: Find the coordinates (decimal degrees) of the bus stop on the Carnegie Museum of Art side of the street near CMU. On OSM, the relevant stops visible are labeled “Forbes Ave at Dithridge St” and “Forbes Ave & S Craig St,” both on the south side of Forbes adjacent to the museum. The most CMU-adjacent is “Forbes Ave & S Craig St.”

The Query features tool is active, but clicking on map tiles failed due to pointer interception. A more reliable approach is to use the Search box to find the bus stop by name and then obtain its coordinates from the result details. Previous search with “bus stop” appended yielded no results; trying the simpler query “Forbes Ave & S Craig St Pittsburgh” may return the public transport stop.

Plan:
1) Enter “Forbes Ave & S Craig St Pittsburgh” in the OSM search box.
2) Click Go in the next step to get results and select the bus stop entry to view coordinates.

Proceed with step 1: fill the search box.

Objective: Provide coordinates (DD format) of the bus stop on the Carnegie Museum of Art side of the street near CMU. We are on OpenStreetMap with the Query features tool enabled, and the map is centered on the Carnegie Museum of Art along Forbes Avenue. The visible bus stops are “Forbes Ave at Dithridge St” and “Forbes Ave & S Craig St,” both on the south (museum) side of Forbes. To get precise coordinates, I should click directly on/near the bus stop icon so the “Nearby features” list includes the bus stop node, which I can then select to view its coordinates.

Current state: The last click on the map container produced a Nearby features list showing only the museum building/relations, meaning the click landed inside the museum polygon rather than on the bus stop. I need a more targeted click near the S Craig St end on the south side. The map tile images with ids 519–526 correspond to the right/east area near S Craig St; clicking one of them should register a map click near that bus stop.

Plan: Click a map tile likely covering the area around “Forbes Ave & S Craig St” bus stop (top-right area of the map). I’ll click element 521 to try to target that area. If successful, the Nearby features list should include a “bus stop” (highway=bus_stop or public_transport=platform/stop_position), which I can select in a subsequent step to read its coordinates.

Objective: Provide coordinates (DD format) of the bus stop on the Carnegie Museum of Art side of the street near CMU. We are on OpenStreetMap with the Query features tool enabled, and the map is centered on the Carnegie Museum of Art along Forbes Avenue. The visible bus stops are “Forbes Ave at Dithridge St” and “Forbes Ave & S Craig St,” both on the south (museum) side of Forbes. To get precise coordinates, I should click directly on/near the bus stop icon so the “Nearby features” list includes the bus stop node, which I can then select to view its coordinates.

Current state: The last click on the map container produced a Nearby features list showing only the museum building/relations, meaning the click landed inside the museum polygon rather than on the bus stop. I need a more targeted click near the S Craig St end on the south side. The map tile images with ids 519–526 correspond to the right/east area near S Craig St; clicking one of them should register a map click near that bus stop.

Plan: Click a map tile likely covering the area around “Forbes Ave & S Craig St” bus stop (top-right area of the map). I’ll click element 521 to try to target that area. If successful, the Nearby features list should include a “bus stop” (highway=bus_stop or public_transport=platform/stop_position), which I can select in a subsequent step to read its coordinates.

✅ Current Progress:
- OpenStreetMap is centered on the Carnegie Museum of Art along Forbes Avenue near CMU.
- “Query features” mode is active.
- Map clicks have been made, but the bus stop has not yet been surfaced; coordinates not retrieved.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- On track: This page and location are appropriate for finding the bus stop coordinates on the museum (south) side of Forbes Ave.
- Relevant interactive elements and states:
  - Map container [401] — focused/visible; clicking precisely near the bus stop icon should populate the Nearby features with the bus stop.
  - Link [454] “Query features” — active/visible (green), required for map clicks to list features.
  - Zoom controls [434] “Zoom In” and [436] “Zoom Out” — visible/enabled; can be used for finer targeting.
  - Left panel “Nearby features” list [536] — currently shows:
    - Building: link [546] “Carnegie Museum of Art”
    - Relation: link [548] “Carnegie Institute and Library”
    - No bus stop entry yet, indicating clicks landed within the museum area rather than on the bus stop.
  - Search textbox [162] (value: “Forbes Ave & S Craig St Pittsburgh”) and Go button [165] — visible/enabled but not required since the map is already at the target area.
  - Button [209] “Close” — visible; can hide the left panel if needed for more map space.

Goal: Provide coordinates (decimal degrees) of the bus stop on the Carnegie Museum of Art side of the street near CMU. We’re on OpenStreetMap at the Carnegie Museum of Art along Forbes Ave with Query features enabled, but clicking the map tiles has been unreliable due to the header intercepting clicks. A better approach is to use the OSM search to select the specific bus stop by name so a marker is placed at that node. Then we can use the Share tool to get the exact marker coordinates (mlat/mlon) and paste them into the search field to read them, following the tip about copying/pasting possibly truncated URLs.

Current UI: The search box (bid 162) shows “Forbes Ave & S Craig St Pittsburgh” (a relevant stop on the museum side). The next step is to execute the search via the Go button (bid 165). This should load search results, and typically selecting the bus stop result will place a marker. We’ll first run the search; then, in subsequent steps, we’ll choose the bus stop result, open Share, copy the URL, and paste to extract coordinates.

Task: Provide coordinates (decimal degrees) of the bus stop on the Carnegie Museum of Art side of the street near CMU. The OpenStreetMap page is centered on Forbes Avenue by the Carnegie Museum of Art with bus stops labeled “Forbes Ave & S Craig St” and “Forbes Ave at Dithridge St” visible. The Query features tool is active (green). To extract exact coordinates, the best approach is to click near the bus stop icon on the south side of Forbes (museum side) using the Query features tool, which should open a "Nearby features" list where the bus stop node can be selected to view its coordinates.

We previously closed the search panel, so the map is unobstructed. Now the next step is to click on the map near the south-side bus stop near S Craig Street. The clickable elements are map tile images; a click on a tile around that location should trigger the Query features panel. I will click image element 520, which likely corresponds to the area near S Craig and the south-side bus stop labeled “Forbes Ave & S Craig St.” After this, I expect a feature list to appear, and then I can select the bus stop to retrieve coordinates in a subsequent step.

The user wants the coordinates in decimal degrees of the bus stop located on the Carnegie Museum of Art side of the street near CMU. On the current OpenStreetMap page, the left panel shows “Search Results” with a clickable result: “Bus Stop Forbes Ave at Dithridge St, Forbes Avenue, … Pittsburgh, … 15213, United States,” and the map displays a pin marker labeled “Forbes Ave at Dithridge St” on the south side of Forbes Avenue adjacent to the Carnegie Museum of Art area. To obtain precise coordinates, the reliable workflow is: select the specific bus stop result to ensure the marker is set at the exact bus stop location, then use the Share tool to copy the URL containing mlat/mlon and paste it into a text field to read the full lat/lon. The immediate next step is to click the search result link [596] to focus/confirm the bus stop marker before proceeding to Share.
