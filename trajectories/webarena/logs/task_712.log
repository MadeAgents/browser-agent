✅ Current Progress: Opened the Reports menu from the Magento Admin dashboard. The “Reports” overlay is visible, but the “Coupons” report has not been selected yet and no date range has been set.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is on the critical path toward the goal. In the Reports overlay, the following relevant interactive element is available:
- link labeled “Coupons” (id: 398) under the “Sales” section — visible and clickable.
Other report links (e.g., “Orders” [383], “Tax” [386]) are present but not relevant to the coupons report objective. No errors or detours detected; proceeding to “Coupons” is appropriate.

The goal is to create a Coupons report for the date range 05/01/2021 to 05/15/2023. I am currently on the Dashboard with the Reports overlay open. In the Sales section of the overlay, there is a clearly labeled "Coupons" link (bid 398). To proceed toward generating the report, I should navigate to the Coupons report page by clicking this link. Once on the Coupons page, I will look for date range fields to enter the specified From and To dates and then use the "Show Report" button to generate it.
