The user wants their RSS feed token. Based on the Task Tips, user-related information like access tokens is available from the "edit profile" page. To access that, I should first open the profile menu using the profile button located at the top-right of the GitLab interface. On the current page, the Accessibility Tree shows a link labeled "Byte Blaze" with bid 201, which is likely the profile button. Clicking it should open a dropdown with options including "Edit profile." The next step is to click this profile button to reveal those options.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the user profile menu (“Byte Blaze” link), revealing account options.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the GitLab Projects dashboard, and the profile dropdown is expanded, which is on the critical path toward finding the RSS feed token. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link “Byte Blaze” [201], expanded=True (menu open).
- Link “Preferences” [219], visible and enabled.
- Link “Edit profile” [217], visible and enabled.
- Button “Edit status” [215], visible and enabled.
- Link “Sign out” [233], visible and enabled.
The “Preferences” [219] link is the key element to proceed toward account-related settings needed for the RSS feed token.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to User Settings and opened the “Edit Profile” page.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This User Settings page is on the critical path, but the “Edit Profile” section does not display any RSS/feed token information. Relevant interactive elements in the sidebar that are likely to lead to the token:
- Link “Account” [249] — visible and enabled.
- Link “Access Tokens” [276] — visible and enabled.
Other visible elements (not directly related to the goal): search box “Search page” [385], “Collapse sidebar” button [356], “Update profile settings” button [597].

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link “Account” [249] to locate the RSS/feed token controls.
- If the token is not found there, click link “Access Tokens” [276].

The user asked for their RSS feed token. I’m on the “Personal Access Tokens” page under User Settings, and I can see a “Feed token” section near the bottom. The token is currently masked in a textbox showing “********************”. There are two buttons next to it: one labeled “Click to reveal” and another “Copy feed token”. The most direct way to obtain the actual token string to report back is to click the “Click to reveal” button so that the masked value becomes visible in the textbox. After revealing, I can read the token from the updated page state and provide it to the user. Therefore, the next best single action is to click the “Click to reveal” button (bid 498).
