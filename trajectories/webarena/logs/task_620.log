The goal is to post a request for advice about dealing with long-distance relationships in a relationships-related subreddit/forum. On the current "List of forums" page, I can see the forum "relationship_advice — relationship_advice" with a clickable link (node [164]). The most efficient path is to navigate into this specific forum first, ensuring that any subsequent submission is correctly targeted to it (rather than using the global "Submit" link). After entering the forum, I will look for a "Submit" or "Create post" option to compose the post, making sure to put all content in the Body field and leave the URL field empty as per the Task Tips. Therefore, the next best single action is to click the relationship_advice forum link.

The task is to create a post asking for advice about dealing with long-distance relationships in a relationships-related subreddit/forum. We are already inside the correct forum: /f/relationship_advice. The next step is to start creating a submission from within this forum so the forum is preselected. The UI shows a "Submit" control in the top bar (node [65]) which should open the submission form. From there, I can fill the post. Per Task Tips, all content provided by the user should go in the Body field and the URL field should be left empty.
