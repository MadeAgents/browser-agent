The user wants to create (submit) a merge request from dialog-component into dialog and assign Carol as the reviewer. I’m currently on the project page for Primer / design. To create a merge request, I should navigate to the project's Merge requests section. In the left sidebar under "Project navigation," there is a "Merge requests" link with accessibility id [354]. Clicking that is the best next step to reach the page where I can create a new merge request, then I can look for a "New merge request" button and set the source/target branches and reviewer. Avoid the global search (it’s not working per tips). No scrolling is needed. I'll click the Merge requests link now.

The task is to submit a merge request from dialog-component into dialog and assign Carol as the reviewer. We are already on the "New merge request" form page with the correct branches set (From dialog-component into dialog). The key remaining steps are: (1) assign the reviewer "Carol" and (2) click "Create merge request." To assign the reviewer, I should open the Reviewer picker by clicking the "Unassigned" button under the Reviewer section. In the accessibility tree, the Reviewer button is [706] labeled "Unassigned." Once opened, I can select Carol in a subsequent step. Therefore, the next best single action is to click the Reviewer "Unassigned" button to open the reviewer selection UI.

The user's goal is to submit a merge request from dialog-component into dialog and assign Carol as the reviewer. We are on the "New merge request" form with the branches correctly set (From dialog-component into dialog). The Reviewer picker is already open. The search box for users (bid 715) currently has "Carol" entered, but the dropdown shows "No matching results," meaning the UI didn't find a matching user with that case. Sometimes GitLab's user search is case-sensitive or matches usernames that are lowercase. Before deciding to invite a new member (which would require leaving the page) or proceeding without setting the reviewer, the least disruptive next step is to try a different query, specifically lowercase "carol," to see if the existing user appears. This is quick and might resolve the issue without navigating away or losing context. I will fill the search box with "carol" to see if a match appears so I can select Carol and proceed to create the MR.

Goal: Submit a merge request from dialog-component into dialog and assign Carol as the reviewer.

Progress so far:
- I created the MR setup: selected source branch “dialog-component” and target branch “dialog,” and reached the MR form.
- Tried to assign “Carol” via the Reviewer picker, but the search returned “No matching results,” indicating Carol is not a project member or her username differs.
- Began navigating to Project information to invite Carol (per tips: Project information > Members > Invite members). I clicked “Project information” in the sidebar; the next step would be the “Members” tab and the blue “Invite members” button.

Constraint:
- To invite a member in GitLab, I need the user’s GitLab username or email. Without matching search results, I likely must invite Carol first to then assign her as reviewer.

Plan:
- Ask the user for Carol’s GitLab username or email so I can invite her to the project, then return to the MR and assign her as reviewer before submitting. This avoids guessing and ensures the invitation succeeds.

Next action: Request Carol’s GitLab username or email to proceed with the invitation and assignment.

Goal: Submit a merge request from dialog-component into dialog and assign Carol as the reviewer.

Progress so far:
- I created the MR setup: selected source branch “dialog-component” and target branch “dialog,” and reached the MR form.
- Tried to assign “Carol” via the Reviewer picker, but the search returned “No matching results,” indicating Carol is not a project member or her username differs.
- Began navigating to Project information to invite Carol (per tips: Project information > Members > Invite members). I clicked “Project information” in the sidebar; the next step would be the “Members” tab and the blue “Invite members” button.

Constraint:
- To invite a member in GitLab, I need the user’s GitLab username or email. Without matching search results, I likely must invite Carol first to then assign her as reviewer.

Plan:
- Ask the user for Carol’s GitLab username or email so I can invite her to the project, then return to the MR and assign her as reviewer before submitting. This avoids guessing and ensures the invitation succeeds.

Next action: Request Carol’s GitLab username or email to proceed with the invitation and assignment.

✅ Current Progress:
- Selected correct branches for the merge request: source “dialog-component” into target “dialog” and proceeded to the MR form.
- Opened the reviewer picker and searched for “Carol”/“carol” (no matching results).
- Began navigation toward inviting Carol by clicking “Project information” and requested Carol’s GitLab username/email from the user.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (Activity · Primer/design) is not the MR form nor the Members page, so it is off the critical path for assigning a reviewer and submitting the MR.
- Relevant interactive elements visible and enabled:
  - Sidebar link “Project information” (id: 268) — needed to reach Members and invite Carol.
  - Sidebar link “Merge requests” (id: 342) — to return to the MR list/form after inviting Carol.
- Reviewer assignment is blocked because “Carol” is not found; likely not a project member.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link “Project information” (id='268') to navigate toward the Members area and invite Carol so she can be assigned as reviewer.
- After inviting Carol, click link “Merge requests” (id='342') to return to the MR section and assign her as reviewer before submitting the merge request.
