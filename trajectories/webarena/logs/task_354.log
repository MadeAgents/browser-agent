The user wants products from the Living Room Furniture category sorted by descending price. Following the shopping/browsing tip, I should use the top navigation dropdowns instead of search. On the homepage, I see the top menu with "Home & Kitchen" (element [708]) which likely contains furniture subcategories. The first step is to hover over "Home & Kitchen" to reveal its submenu, where I will look for "Furniture" and then "Living Room Furniture". Once visible, I will click into that category and then apply a sort by price descending. For now, I need to hover "Home & Kitchen" to open the nested menu.

✅ Current Progress: Hovered over the “Home & Kitchen” top navigation item to reveal its submenu.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the site homepage and remains on the critical path to reach the Living Room Furniture category. The “Home & Kitchen” menu (menuitem [708]) is active, showing a vertical submenu (menu [711]). Within this submenu, the “Furniture” entry (menuitem [713], hasPopup='menu', visible/enabled) is present and is the correct next focus to access its child categories. The specific “Living Room Furniture” subcategory is not yet visible in the axtree, indicating it likely appears after hovering over or expanding “Furniture.”
