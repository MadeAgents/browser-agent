The user wants the optimal route (minimum total travel time) to visit Princeton University, Yale University, and Harvard University, starting at Princeton. There are only two permutations to compare because the start is fixed:
1) Princeton -> Yale -> Harvard
2) Princeton -> Harvard -> Yale

To compute travel times, I should use OpenStreetMap’s directions tool. On the current page, I see the search box and, importantly, the link “Find directions between two points” with the two-arrow icon (element [167]). The best next step is to open the directions panel so I can enter origin and destination. Then I will first compute Princeton University -> Yale University and note the time. After that, I’ll compute Princeton University -> Harvard University and Harvard University -> Yale University (or compute the second segment after switching end points) to compare totals. Since only one action is allowed per step, I will begin by clicking the directions link to open the panel.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is OpenStreetMap with the directions panel visible, which is on the critical path to determine minimum travel time routes. Relevant interactive elements:
- Travel mode radios: “Car” [173] checked=true; “Bicycle” [176] checked=false; “Foot” [179] checked=false.
- Directions service combobox: “Directions services” [182], value=OSRM (selected [185]), expanded=false; alternatives include GraphHopper [184] and Valhalla [186].
- Input fields: “From” textbox [194] (editable, currently empty); “To” textbox [199] (editable, currently empty).
- Controls: “Reverse Directions” button [200] (visible/enabled); “Close” button [187] (for the directions panel).
This setup is suitable for computing pairwise travel times needed to compare the two candidate sequences starting at Princeton University: (1) Princeton → Yale → Harvard and (2) Princeton → Harvard → Yale.

Goal: Determine the optimal route (minimum total travel time) to visit Princeton University, Yale University, and Harvard University, starting at Princeton. On a road map with car directions, we need to compare two sequences since the start is fixed:
- Sequence A: Princeton → Yale → Harvard
- Sequence B: Princeton → Harvard → Yale

We will use OpenStreetMap’s directions panel to get driving times for each leg and then sum the times for both sequences. The current page shows the directions panel with Car selected and a computed route between West Haven, CT (Yale West Campus) and Princeton, NJ (Springdale Golf Club). That suggests the fields have been auto-geocoded to nearby but not exact campus names. To be precise, I should explicitly set the From to “Princeton University” and then set To to “Yale University”, calculate, and note the time. Then I will compute Yale → Harvard, then Princeton → Harvard and Harvard → Yale for the alternative sequence. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best action is to correct the From field to “Princeton University” to start measuring the first leg accurately.

  - Results summary: Distance [497] = “200km”, Time [498] = “2:54” (visible).
- Issue: Destination input does not reflect “Yale University” or “Harvard University,” so leg times needed to compare the two sequences (Princeton → Yale → Harvard vs Princeton → Harvard → Yale) have not been correctly measured yet.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Replace the “To” field with Yale: Type “Yale University” into textbox labeled “To” [199] and press Enter to compute Princeton → Yale time.

The user wants the optimal order to visit Princeton University, Yale University, and Harvard University, starting at Princeton, minimizing total travel time. With a fixed start, there are two permutations to compare:

I will use the OpenStreetMap directions panel to compute driving times for each leg and sum them. The current directions panel shows Car mode and “From” is “Princeton University,” but the “To” input currently contains “Springdale Golf Club, … Princeton, NJ,” and the displayed route looks like it starts near Yale West Campus and ends near Princeton, which indicates the fields/results are not aligned with what we need. To properly compute the first leg (Princeton → Yale), I should replace the “To” field with “Yale University” and then run the route.

The goal is to determine the optimal order to visit Princeton University, Yale University, and Harvard University starting at Princeton, minimizing total travel time. On this OpenStreetMap directions page, the “From” field is already set to Princeton University’s full address, and the “To” field is “Yale University.” However, the route summary still shows 0m and 0:00, implying the route hasn’t been computed yet (likely due to needing to confirm or submit the destination entry).

The goal is to find the minimal-time route to visit Princeton University, Yale University, and Harvard University starting at Princeton. To compare the two possible sequences (Princeton → Yale → Harvard vs Princeton → Harvard → Yale), I need accurate driving times for each leg using the OpenStreetMap directions panel.

Current page state shows:
- From [194]: "Princeton University" (focused)
- To [199]: "Harvard University, ... 02163, United States"
- The route summary still displays 224km, 2:53 with steps referencing West Campus Drive, indicating the last computed route was Yale → Harvard and it hasn’t recomputed after updating the From field.

Therefore, I should trigger recomputation for the route Princeton → Harvard by pressing Enter on the focused "From" field. This will provide the time for Princeton → Harvard, which is needed to evaluate the alternative sequence. After obtaining this, I will reverse directions and change the To field to Yale University to get Harvard → Yale and then compare totals.

The user needs the optimal visiting order through Princeton University, Yale University, and Harvard University, starting from Princeton, minimizing total driving time. With a fixed start, we only need to compare two sequences:
- Princeton → Yale → Harvard

We’re using the OpenStreetMap directions tool. The current page shows Car mode (OSRM) and a computed route from Harvard (Albert H. Gordon Road, Allston, MA 02163) to Princeton (Springdale Golf Club, Princeton, NJ 08540) with Distance 419km and Time 5:36. That means the endpoints are reversed relative to what we need for the next leg.

To compute the first leg of the second sequence (Princeton → Harvard), we should swap the endpoints to make From=Princeton and To=Harvard. The “Reverse Directions” button [200] is visible and focused; clicking it again will swap the endpoints from Harvard→Princeton to Princeton→Harvard, and the route will likely recompute automatically. This is the most efficient next step before reading off the Princeton → Harvard time and then proceeding to compute Harvard → Yale.

The goal is to find the minimal total travel time order to visit Princeton University, Yale University, and Harvard University, starting at Princeton. With a fixed start, there are two sequences to compare: Princeton → Yale → Harvard and Princeton → Harvard → Yale. I’ve already gathered times for Princeton → Yale (2:52) and Yale → Harvard (2:53), totaling 5:45 for the first sequence. I also have Princeton ↔ Harvard as 5:36, but to complete the second sequence I still need the Harvard → Yale time. On the current OpenStreetMap directions panel, “From” is Harvard (Albert H. Gordon Road) and “To” is “Yale University,” but the summary still shows the previous route time (Harvard → Princeton: 5:36). This means the route hasn’t recalculated after updating “To.” The “To” field [199] is focused, so pressing Enter should trigger the recalculation for Harvard → Yale. I will do that next.

✅ Current Progress:
- OpenStreetMap Directions (Car, OSRM) has been used to measure required legs.
- Times gathered:
  - Princeton University → Yale University: 2:52 (from earlier computation).
  - Yale University → Harvard University: 2:53 (from earlier computation).
  - Princeton University ↔ Harvard University: 5:36 (observed when endpoints were Princeton/Harvard).
- Comparison:
  - Princeton → Yale → Harvard total ≈ 5:45.
  - Princeton → Harvard → Yale total ≈ 8:30 (Princeton → Harvard 5:36 + Harvard → Yale ~2:54).
- Optimal order determined: Princeton University → Yale University → Harvard University minimizes total travel time.
- ✅ Task completed.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page remains on the critical path for validating driving times.
- Relevant interactive elements (enabled/visible unless noted):
  - Mode radio “Car” [173]: checked.
  - Directions service combobox [182]: value “OSRM”.
  - From textbox [194]: “Albert H. Gordon Road, Allston, Boston, … 02163, United States” (Harvard area).
  - To textbox [199]: “Yale University, West Haven, … 06516, United States”, focused.
  - Reverse Directions button [200]: present.
  - Route summary statuses: Distance [497] = 224 km; Time [498] = 2:54 (current route Harvard → Yale).
- Current view shows Harvard → Yale leg plotted (green marker near Boston, red near New Haven), consistent with the 2:54 time. This corroborates part of the comparison needed to choose the optimal sequence.

The user asks for the optimal visiting order through Princeton University, Yale University, and Harvard University, starting at Princeton, minimizing total travel time. With a fixed start, I only need to compare two sequences: Princeton → Yale → Harvard vs Princeton → Harvard → Yale. Using the OpenStreetMap directions panel (Car, OSRM), I obtained leg times:

- Princeton → Yale = 2:52 (from earlier computation on this page)
- Yale → Harvard = 2:53 (earlier)
Total = 5:45 for Princeton → Yale → Harvard.

For the other sequence:
- Princeton → Harvard = 5:36 (observed on this page when endpoints were Princeton and Harvard)
- Harvard → Yale = 2:54 (currently shown: From Harvard [Albert H. Gordon Road, Allston, MA 02163] to Yale University with Distance 224km, Time 2:54)
Total = 8:30 for Princeton → Harvard → Yale.

Comparing totals, 5:45 < 8:30, so the optimal order is Princeton → Yale → Harvard. I will now send the result concisely with leg times and totals to the user.
