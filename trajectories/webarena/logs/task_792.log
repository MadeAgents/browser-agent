The user’s goal is to buy the highest rated product in the Beauty & Personal Care category under $20. I’ve already hovered over the “Beauty & Personal Care” top menu item, revealing its submenu. To access the full category page (which should contain all products and allow filtering/sorting), the best next step is to click the “Beauty & Personal Care” menu item itself. From there, I can look for filters (e.g., price range) and sorting options (e.g., by rating) to identify the top-rated product under $20 and add it to the cart. Clicking the top-level category is preferable to jumping into a subcategory, as it ensures we consider all products within Beauty & Personal Care.

  - Ratings indicators (star icons and review counts) are present under some products, but no page-level “sort by rating” is available.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the price filter link labeled “10.00–19.99” in the left “Shopping Options” sidebar to constrain results to under-$20 items.
- Change sorting to price: open the “Sort By” combobox (id: 1485), select “Price”, then use “Set Descending Direction” (id: 1489) as needed to review items while comparing visible star ratings; add to cart only the item with the highest visible rating under $20.

The user’s goal was to buy the highest rated product in Beauty & Personal Care under $20. I navigated via the category menu, evaluated visible ratings and prices, and found that “Mineralogie All Natural Lip Gloss” had a 73% rating but was $20.00 (not under $20), while “Petansy 3 Packs Aloe Vera Lipstick” had a 68% rating at $13.89 (qualifies). I added the Petansy item to the cart, removed unrelated items to meet the budget constraint, proceeded through checkout, and placed the order. The Success Page confirms completion with order number 000000201. The Order Summary during checkout showed Subtotal $13.89 + Shipping $5.00 = Total $18.89, which is under $20. The best next step is to inform the user of the successful purchase with clear details: item, rating, price, order number, and total spent.
