The user wants me to reorder a previously cancelled mattress foundation from around Feb or March 2023. To find and reorder it, I should navigate to the user's order history.

Clicking this should take me to the account dashboard where I can locate "My Orders," filter by date or scan for Feb/March 2023, find the cancelled order with the mattress foundation, and use a Reorder button if available.

✅ Current Progress:
- Logged in and arrived at the My Account dashboard.
- Account info and recent orders are visible, but the full order history (needed to reach Feb–Mar 2023) has not been opened yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to the goal. From here, you can access order history to locate the canceled mattress foundation order from Feb/Mar 2023.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link “My Orders” (left sidebar, marker id: [1454]) — visible and enabled. This should lead to the complete order history where older/canceled orders can be found.
  - “Recent Orders” section (heading marker id: [1457]) — shows only recent entries (e.g., 12/16/25). Each row includes a “View Order” link (visible/enabled), but these are unlikely to reach the 2023 order; use “My Orders” for full history.
- No errors or detours detected; navigation is on track toward reordering the previously canceled item.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is directly on the critical path to reordering the previously canceled mattress foundation.

    - “Reorder” (e.g., [1381] for 5/2/23 row, [1403] for 3/11/23 row) — visible/clickable.
  - The current page shows several Feb–Mar 2023 rows with Status “Canceled” (e.g., entries around 3/8/23, 3/4/23, 2/27/23, 2/25/23, 2/19/23) each with “View Order” and “Reorder” links in the Action column.
  - Pagination indicates “Items 11 to 20 of 45 total,” confirming we are viewing older orders where the target timeframe resides.
- Next logical move on this page is to open “View Order” for the canceled entries in Feb–Mar 2023 to confirm which contains the mattress foundation, then use that row’s “Reorder” link to proceed.

The user wants me to reorder a previously canceled mattress foundation. I've already found the canceled order from Feb 24, 2023 (#000000156) containing the correct mattress foundation and used the Reorder function, which brought us to the Checkout page at the Shipping step. The Shipping Address is populated for Emma Lopez, and the shipping method "Fixed Flat Rate" at $5.00 is selected. To proceed toward placing the order, the next logical step is to advance to the "Review & Payments" step by clicking the visible "Next" button (bid 816). This aligns with the checkout flow and will allow me to confirm payment and place the order if possible.
