🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path for updating inventory, but the current product filter is unrelated to the goal.
- Active filter shows “Keyword: Diana Tights”; results display “13 records found” for that keyword.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - textbox “Search by keyword” [1397] — visible, filled with “Diana Tights”.
  - button “Search” [1398] — visible and enabled.
  - button “Clear all” [914] — visible; clears active filters.

This filter is off-track for finding “Cronus Yoga Pants (Blue, size 33)”.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click “Clear all” button [914] to remove the “Diana Tights” filter.
- Type “Cronus Yoga Pants” into the “Search by keyword” textbox [1397] and click the “Search” button [1398].

The user wants to update stock for the specific variant Cronus Yoga Pant -33-Blue by adding 5 units. I’m already on the edit page for that exact simple product (SKU MP12-33-Blue). I can see the “[global] Quantity” field [1021] currently set to 0, and “Stock Status” [1031] is “Out of Stock.” To start the update, the first step is to change the quantity to 5. After setting the quantity, I will need to set Stock Status to “In Stock” and save, but since only one action is allowed at a time, the next best single action is to fill the Quantity field with “5.”
