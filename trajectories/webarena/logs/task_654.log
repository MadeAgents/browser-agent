The user wants me to fill out the Contact Us form requesting a refund for a Bluetooth speaker, including order number #161 and the product SKU. To include the SKU, I need to locate it from the user's past purchases. The top banner shows a "My Account" link, which typically leads to account information and order history. From there, I can navigate to My Orders, find order #161, and view the product details to retrieve the SKU. Once I have the SKU, I will go to the Contact Us page and fill the form with the message, but not submit it. The immediate next step is to click "My Account" to access the order details.

✅ Current Progress: No progress made yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is “My Account,” which is relevant to the goal because it provides access to order details needed to include the product SKU. Key interactive elements visible and enabled:
- Link labeled “My Orders” in the left sidebar (visible text: “My Orders”).
- “Recent Orders” table with rows showing “Order #” and “View Order” links (visible text: “View Order” for each row).
- Footer link labeled “Contact Us” (visible text: “Contact Us”), which leads to the form to be filled once the SKU is confirmed.
The search button is disabled and not relevant. No contact form fields are visible yet.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the link labeled “My Orders” in the left sidebar to open the full orders list.
- In the orders list, click the “View Order” link in the row where Order # equals “000000161” to access the order details and retrieve the product SKU.

The user wants me to fill out the Contact Us form with a refund request for a Bluetooth speaker, including order number #161 and the product SKU, and not submit it yet.

    - [1379] link “View Order” for Order #000000197
    - [1390] link “View Order” for Order #000000196

- The “Search” button in the header [272] is disabled and not relevant.

Order #000000161 is not currently visible in the first page of results; use the pagination to reach the page containing that order, then click its “View Order” to access the SKU. The contact form is not yet open on this page.

The user asked me to fill the Contact Us form requesting a refund for a Bluetooth speaker that broke after three days, and include order number #161 and the product SKU, without submitting yet. I’m currently on the “My Orders” page, which lists orders with pagination (Items 1 to 10 of 45 total).

To locate order #000000161, the most efficient next step is to navigate directly to Page 5 (bid 1506), which should contain the oldest orders including #161. Once there, I will find the row for order #161, click “View Order,” retrieve the product SKU for the Bluetooth speaker, then navigate to the “Contact Us” link in the footer and fill the form with the refund request message incorporating the order number and SKU.

The goal is to fill the Contact Us form to request a refund for a Bluetooth speaker, including order #161 and the product SKU, without submitting. To include the SKU, I need to open the order details for #000000161 first.

I am currently on the My Orders page (Items 31–40 of 45 total), which corresponds to page 4. The orders shown include 185, 179, 175, 172, 155, 165, 149, 167, 182, 181. Previously, page 5 showed orders 168, 159, 173, 160, 169—so #161 was not there. Because page 5 includes nearby numbers 159 and 160 but not 161, #161 is likely on page 3. The pagination control includes a “Page 3” link (bid 1502). The best next step is to click “Page 3” to locate order #000000161. Once I find it, I’ll click “View Order” to get the SKU, then navigate to “Contact Us” in the footer to fill the form with the refund request including both order #161 and the SKU. Only a single action is allowed now, so I will click “Page 3.”

 <think>
The user wants me to fill out the Contact Us form with a refund request for a Bluetooth speaker that broke after three days, including order number #161 and the product SKU, and not submit it yet. On the current Contact Us page, the Name and Email fields are already filled. The key required field to complete is the “What’s on your mind? *” textbox (bid 1383). I previously navigated to the order details for #000000161 and noted the product SKU as B09P7BFL4H. The best next action is to fill the message textbox with a clear refund request including the order number and SKU, and refrain from submission.
