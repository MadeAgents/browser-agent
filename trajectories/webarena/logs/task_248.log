The user wants the coordinates of "Carnegie Mellon Café" in decimal degrees using OpenStreetMap only. The current page is OpenStreetMap with a visible Search textbox (bid 162) focused and a Go button (bid 165). The best approach is to use the search box to find the location. According to the general tips, it's best to use search rather than scrolling. I will first input "Carnegie Mellon Café" into the search field, then in the next step click Go to get results. This step will set up the query.

✅ Current Progress: Entered the query “Carnegie Mellon Café” into the OpenStreetMap search box.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap’s main map and is on the critical path to find coordinates. Relevant elements:
- Textbox labeled “Search” (id [162]): visible, focused, value set to “Carnegie Mellon Café”.
- Button “Go” (id [165]): visible and enabled, adjacent to the search field—pressing it should execute the search.
- Optional: “Close” button (id [217]) for the welcome overlay—visible; can be used to clear the left pane if it obstructs results.
- Other links (e.g., “Find directions between two points” [167]) are not needed for the goal.

The user wants the coordinates of "Carnegie Mellon Café" in decimal degrees. We are on OpenStreetMap with the search box already filled with "Carnegie Mellon Café" (bid 162). The next logical step is to trigger the search using the "Go" button (bid 165). This should display search results in the left panel. From there, I will identify the relevant result—likely the one in Pittsburgh, PA per the tips—and then access the details to get coordinates. But first, I need to execute the search. I will click the "Go" button.

✅ Current Progress: Executed the search for “Carnegie Mellon Café.” Search results are displayed, and the map shows a marker at the café location.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to obtain coordinates. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link [481] “Carnegie Mellon Café, 5125, Margaret Morrison Street, …” — visible and enabled; selecting it confirms the target place.
- Map marker button [503] (at “Carnegie Mellon Café”) — visible and enabled; clicking typically opens an info popup at the location.
- Link [448] “Share” — visible and enabled; opens a panel that displays the map center’s latitude/longitude (useful after centering on the café/marker).
- Link [454] “Query features” — visible and enabled; can be used to click the café feature and view details that may include coordinates.
- Textbox [162] “Search” — visible, value is “Carnegie Mellon Café”; no further input needed.
- Zoom controls [434] “Zoom In” and [436] “Zoom Out” — visible and enabled; can refine positioning before using Share.

The user wants the decimal degree coordinates of Carnegie Mellon Café from OpenStreetMap. The current page shows the search results with the café marked on the map. The URL hash indicates the map is centered at "#map=19/40.442419/-79.939739", which corresponds to latitude 40.442419 and longitude -79.939739. This typically reflects the location of the selected search result. Since the task is to provide coordinates in DD format and the coordinates are clearly available, the most efficient next step is to deliver them directly to the user without additional navigation.
