The user wants to cancel order 299. On the Dashboard page, under the "Last Orders" section, I see a row for Sarah Miller with a link to the order view page: http://10.177.37.113:7780/admin/sales/order/view/order_id/299/. The quickest way to proceed is to click that row to open the order detail page, where I can look for the Cancel button. I will click the row associated with order 299 to navigate to its details.

The task is to cancel order #000000299. I’m already on the order’s detail page, confirmed by the heading “#000000299” and the order status showing “Pending.” At the top action bar, there’s a visible “Cancel” button (bid 736), which is the correct control for canceling a pending order in Magento. The previous action to open the order page is complete; no need to navigate elsewhere. The next best step is to click the “Cancel” button. If a confirmation prompt appears afterward, I will handle it in a subsequent step.
