The user wants to add two users as Reporter to the repository "millennials-to-snake-people". According to the tips, the workflow is: open the project, go to Project information > Members, click "Invite members", search and select each user, set the role to Reporter, and add them. 

Currently, the dashboard page shows a list of projects. I can see the project "Byte Blaze / millennials-to-snake-people" with link element [435]. The first step is to navigate into that project's page. Once inside, I will look for the Members tab under Project information, and proceed with invitations. Therefore, the next single action is to click the project link [435] to open it.

The user’s goal is to add two users, “yjlou” and “a11yproject”, to the “millennials-to-snake-people” project as Reporters. I’m already on the Project members page, and the “Invite members” modal is open. From the accessibility tree, I can see that “yjlou” has been selected (there’s an option token for yjlou in the invite field). Next, I need to add the second user “a11yproject” and then set the role to Reporter before inviting.

The relevant elements in the modal:
- The "Username or email address" textbox [854] where I can type the next username.
- The role combobox [865] currently shows value “Guest” with options including “Reporter”; I will change this after both users are added.
- The “Invite” button [886] will be clicked at the end.

Since only one action can be performed now, the next step is to enter “a11yproject” in the username/email field to bring up the suggestion and prepare for selection.
