The user asks for customer names who complain about the quality of EYZUTAK phone cases. To find this, I should locate the EYZUTAK phone case product page and review its customer reviews. The most efficient way is to use the site’s search bar rather than browsing categories, since the product brand is specific. On the page, the search combobox is available at node [386]. I will enter a relevant query like "EYZUTAK phone case" to bring up the product(s). After the results load, I can navigate to the product page and then to the reviews section to identify complaints about quality and list the reviewer names. The first step is to fill the search field.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the EYZUTAK product page and opened the Customer Reviews section.
- Viewed both reviews pages (Page 2, then back to Page 1).
- Sent the user a list of reviewer names who complain about quality.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is directly relevant to the goal: it is the EYZUTAK product detail page with the “Customer Reviews” list visible.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link “12 Reviews” [1535] — visible; opens/scrolls to the reviews section.
  - Reviews list — visible; each review shows “Review by [name]” and text for assessing quality complaints.
  - Pagination links — “Page 2” [2269] (enabled/clickable) and “Page 1” [2364] (currently selected).
- Quality check: The response sent to the user likely contains name/spelling inaccuracies compared to visible bylines in the screenshot (e.g., “Diana Alcaraz” vs “Alcazar,” “Amanda” vs “Dora,” “Evelyn Kurver” vs “kurry”). This suggests the final list may need verification and correction.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click pagination link “Page 2” (node [2269]) to re-check the remaining reviews for quality complaints and capture exact “Review by [name]” spellings; then click “Page 1” (node [2364]) to verify the rest before updating the answer.
- If the reviews are not in view, click “12 Reviews” (node [1535]) to ensure the reviews section is open.
