The user wants the description page of Whole Foods near Carnegie Mellon on OpenStreetMap. I’m currently on the OpenStreetMap homepage with the search textbox focused (bid 162) and a “Go” button (bid 165). The map is centered on Hong Kong, so I need to use the search bar to locate the relevant place in Pittsburgh. According to the tips, the best approach is to use the search bar rather than trying to manually navigate. I should enter a specific query that targets Whole Foods near Carnegie Mellon, such as “Whole Foods Market near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA,” which should return the East Liberty Whole Foods. After filling the search field, I will click “Go” in the subsequent step to see the results and then select the correct one. For now, the single best next action is to fill the search box with that query.

The current OpenStreetMap page shows "No results found" for the initial query “Whole Foods Market near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA.” This might be due to the complex query and possibly the map’s bounding box being set to Hong Kong.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap, which is appropriate for the goal. However, the map viewport is centered around Hong Kong, far from Pittsburgh, and the search returned no results—likely due to viewport-constrained search.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Recenter to the target city: Type “Pittsburgh, PA” into the Search textbox (node 162), then click the “Go” button (node 165).
- After the map centers on Pittsburgh, replace the query with “Whole Foods Market, 5880 Centre Ave” in the Search textbox (node 162) and click “Go” (node 165) to load the place’s description entry.

The user wants the description page for the Whole Foods near Carnegie Mellon on OpenStreetMap. My previous search with the full query “Whole Foods Market, 5880 Centre Ave, Pittsburgh, PA” returned “No results found,” likely due to the specificity of the business name in Nominatim.

✅ Current Progress:
- Re-centered the map to Pittsburgh and searched for “5880 Centre Ave, Pittsburgh, PA.”
- Search Results panel is open with multiple results for that address.
- The specific Whole Foods description page has not been opened yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is relevant and on the critical path (OpenStreetMap search/results around the target address).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Textbox “Search” (id 162): visible, focused, value='5880 Centre Ave, Pittsburgh, PA'.
  - Button “Go” (id 165): visible, enabled.
  - Results at the address (clickable links):
    - “Retail Building” → link text “5880, Centre Avenue, …, United States” (id 536).
    - “Artwork” → same address (id 538).
    - “House” → same address (id 540).
  - Numerous “Centre Avenue” road segment links (e.g., ids 571, 573, 575, 577, 579, 581, 583, 585, 587, 589, 617, 619, 621, 623): visible, clickable.
  - “Close” button (id 209): visible, enabled.
- The specific POI “Whole Foods Market” is not visible in the current results list; expanding results has surfaced mostly road segments and generic features.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Type “Whole Foods Market, Pittsburgh, PA” into the Search textbox (id 162), then click the “Go” button (id 165).
- Alternatively, click the “Retail Building” result link (id 536) for 5880 Centre Avenue to open its feature page.

The user wants the description page of Whole Foods near Carnegie Mellon on OpenStreetMap. I previously searched for “5880 Centre Ave, Pittsburgh, PA,” which corresponds to the Whole Foods location in East Liberty near CMU. The results list shows generic entries (Retail Building, Artwork, House) and many “Centre Avenue” road segments, but not the specific Whole Foods POI. On the map, there is a red marker within the large building south of Centre Avenue, which likely marks the relevant feature at that address. Clicking the red marker should open a popup with the POI details, including a link to the feature’s description page. The Accessibility Tree shows a button near the red marker (bid 563). The best next step is to click that marker to try to reveal the Whole Foods POI and access its description page.

- Tags confirm building=retail at the correct address (5880 Centre Avenue).
- The specific Whole Foods POI description page has not been opened yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is relevant and on the critical path but currently shows the building’s feature page, not the “Whole Foods Market” POI.

  - Feature details show Tags (addr:*; building=retail) and Nodes list (includes a node with tourism=artwork), but no shop=supermarket/name entry for Whole Foods on this page.
- Conclusion: On-track at the correct location, but not yet on the specific Whole Foods POI description page.

Clicking any of these map tile images should register a click in the map viewport and trigger the Query features result list for the clicked position.

Goal: Open the description page for the Whole Foods near Carnegie Mellon on OpenStreetMap. I’m currently on the OSM page for “Way: 5880 Centre Avenue (34317357)” which is the building at the address where Whole Foods is located, but not the store’s POI itself. The “Query features” tool (button 454) has already been activated (green with tooltip), which is the right tool to list all features at a clicked location.

My last attempt to click on a map tile image (bid 552) timed out because the map container div intercepted the click. To successfully trigger the query, I should click the map container itself rather than a tile image. The error log shows the map container has bid 401 (<div id="map" bid="401">). Clicking this should register a click on the map and bring up the query results for features at that position, likely including “Whole Foods Market,” which I can then open in a subsequent step.

Hence, the best next action is to click the map container (bid 401) to run the query at the current location.
