✅ Current Progress: The search field is populated with “jacyanthis”. No navigation to that user’s posts or the earthporn forum yet; no downvotes performed.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page shows a general feed on Postmill, not filtered to user “jacyanthis” or the earthporn forum, so it’s not yet on the critical path to disliking that user’s earthporn submissions.
- Relevant elements:
  - searchbox “Search query” (id: 55), focused, value='jacyanthis', enabled.
  - Navigation tabs: “Submissions” (id: 118) and “Comments” (id: 120), visible.
  - Feed items include voting controls like “Downvote” (e.g., ids: 195, 239, 283), enabled, but these belong to posts submitted by “MarvelsGrantMan136”, not “jacyanthis”.
  - Filter controls: “Filter on: Subscribed” (button id: 123) and “Sort by: Hot” (button id: 138); not directly relevant to the goal.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Submit the search: with focus on the searchbox labeled “Search query” (id: 55), press Enter to run the search for “jacyanthis”.

The goal is to dislike (downvote) all submissions by the user "jacyanthis" in the "earthporn" forum. The current search results page shows "No results for jacyanthis," so site-wide search didn’t help. Based on the task tips, to find a specific subreddit/forum it’s better to use the Forums tab and then locate "earthporn" (possibly via the alphabetical listing). Once inside the "earthporn" forum, I can look for a way to filter or search by author, or scan for posts by "jacyanthis" and apply dislikes.

I’m currently on the user's profile page showing an overview with one visible submission in the "philosophy" forum, not the target forum. To efficiently find all authored posts and identify those in EarthPorn, I should switch to the "Submissions" tab. From there, I can scan for posts where the community link is "EarthPorn" and downvote them. The accessibility tree lists the "Submissions" link as element [113]. Clicking it is the logical next step.

The task is to downvote all submissions by "jacyanthis" in the EarthPorn forum. I’m currently on the user’s Submissions page, but the visible post is in "philosophy," not EarthPorn. I need to navigate to the EarthPorn forum to locate any submissions by this user there, ideally using search or filters on that forum page. The top navigation has a "Forums" link (bid 37). From there, I can select "Alphabetical" and then "EarthPorn," where I’ll look for posts by "jacyanthis" and downvote them. The next single action should be to click the "Forums" link to move toward the EarthPorn forum.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Forums list and switched to Alphabetical previously; opened the EarthPorn forum once.
- Visited user profile and the Submissions tab for “jacyanthis”.
- Currently back on the “List of forums” page.
- No dislikes/downvotes have been applied yet to “jacyanthis” posts in EarthPorn.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (“List of forums”) is adjacent to the goal but not directly enabling the action of disliking “jacyanthis” submissions in EarthPorn. You still need to reach either the EarthPorn forum page or the user’s submissions filtered to EarthPorn posts.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link “Alphabetical” [117] — visible/enabled; helps locate the EarthPorn forum quickly.
  - Button “Sort by: Submissions” [120] — visible/enabled; not essential right now.
  - Searchbox “Search query” [50] — visible/enabled; currently empty; can be used to search for “earthporn”.
  - Multiple forum links (e.g., “AskReddit” [144], “worldnews” [184]); “EarthPorn” is not visible on the current page view.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link “Alphabetical” [117] to reorder forums and more easily locate EarthPorn.
- Type “earthporn” into the searchbox labeled “Search query” [50] and press Enter to find the EarthPorn forum, then proceed to locate posts by “jacyanthis” and dislike them.

Goal: Dislike (downvote) all submissions created by user "jacyanthis" in the EarthPorn forum.

Current page: EarthPorn forum feed. None of the visible posts are by "jacyanthis". The site’s tips suggest visiting the user profile to see all submissions and then identify those in EarthPorn. I previously visited /u/jacyanthis and clicked Submissions, seeing at least one post in a different forum (philosophy). To efficiently find any EarthPorn posts by this user and apply downvotes, I should go directly to their Submissions page (which typically lists posts with their forums) and then downvote any entries whose forum is EarthPorn. From there, I can use pagination if needed.

Next step: Navigate directly to /u/jacyanthis/submissions to view all their submissions and locate any in EarthPorn to downvote.

  - Global search box “Search query” [49] (visible, empty).
- To achieve the goal from here: identify submissions whose forum link is “EarthPorn” and click their “Downvote” button [153]. The currently visible submission is not in EarthPorn, so relevant entries need to be located (e.g., by scanning this list).

 <think>
The user’s goal is to downvote all submissions by “jacyanthis” in the EarthPorn forum. I navigated to the user profile and opened the Submissions tab (current page shows “Submissions”). The accessibility tree and screenshot display only one submission by “jacyanthis,” titled “75% of people believe that sentient AIs deserve to be treated with respect.” It is explicitly in the “philosophy” forum (link [132] shows “philosophy”). There are no other submissions visible on this page, and no pagination or additional entries are evident above the fold. Given the environment’s constraint against scrolling and the visible content, it appears the user has no submissions in EarthPorn. Therefore, there are no items to downvote that match the requested forum. The appropriate next step is to inform the user that there are no EarthPorn submissions by this user, so nothing can be downvoted.
