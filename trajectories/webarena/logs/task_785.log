The user asked for the email address of the contributor with the most commits to branch "gh-page". On GitLab, the "Contributors" tab under the repository section typically provides commit counts and allows filtering by branch. I need to navigate to the Repository section first and then find the "Contributors" tab, where I can select the branch filter to "gh-page". Currently, the page is the project overview/tree view and the sidebar shows a "Repository" link [295]. Clicking this should take me to the repository area where the sub-tabs for Commits, Branches, Contributors are available. From there, I can proceed to select the branch and identify the top contributor and their email. The next best single action is to click the "Repository" link to access those tabs.

    - “Branches” (id: [309]) — visible, enabled.
- To find the top contributor and their email for the “gh-page” branch, the agent will need to open “Contributors” and set the branch to “gh-page” via the branch dropdown.

- To identify the top contributor for “gh-page,” the branch must be changed from “development” to “gh-page.” The contributors’ emails should then be visible within the filtered list/cards.

  - Branch list entries within the open menu (e.g., “development” link id: [2614], others visible) — enabled; “gh-page” is not currently visible and likely needs to be filtered via the search box.
  - “Close” button (id: [505]) — visible; not needed until the correct branch is selected.
- Screenshot indicates “Commits to development,” confirming the current branch context is still “development.” Selecting the “gh-page” branch is required before identifying the top contributor and retrieving their email.
