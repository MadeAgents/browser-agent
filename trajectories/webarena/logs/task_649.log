The user wants me to create a new post in the "history" forum (subreddit) about the topic phrase: "what could diffusion model help the corresponding field." Following the site tips: to create a post, I should click "Submit", then choose the correct forum and fill in the form. The key constraints: put all content in the Body field, leave the URL blank, and preserve exact text formatting from the task request. The first step is to open the submission form by clicking the "Submit" link visible in the header (accessibility tree shows link 'Submit' at [63]). Once the form opens, I can select the forum 'history' and then enter the exact content into the body (and likely set the title, ideally mirroring the content to be safe, but the immediate action is to open the submit page).

✅ Current Progress: Opened the “Create submission” page via the Submit link; submission form is now visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to posting in the history subreddit/forum. Key elements and their states:
- Post type radios: “URL” (checked) and “Image” (unchecked).
- URL input (text box following the “URL” option): visible, currently empty.
- Title textbox (“Title *”): required, currently empty.
- Body textbox (“Body”): visible, currently empty.
- Forum selector (combobox labeled “Forum *”, value “Choose one…”): no forum selected yet; needs “history”.
- “Create submission” button: visible.
To meet the goal, the forum must be set to “history” and at least the required “Title” must be filled. If a text-only post is intended, ensure the chosen post type and fields align with form requirements (e.g., whether URL is mandatory when “URL” is selected).

The Forum combobox is already expanded, showing a long list of forums, including "history" with bid 607. Previously, I attempted to type into the combobox search (fill on bid 384), but it failed because the element is a span, not a real input.
