The user's goal is to determine if the AMC theatre in Pittsburgh can be reached within one hour by car from Hobart Street. On OpenStreetMap, the best way is to use the built-in directions tool, which is accessible by the "Find directions between two points" button next to the Go button. From there, I can set the starting point as "Hobart Street, Pittsburgh, PA" and the destination as "AMC Theatre, Pittsburgh, PA" (or similar), and select the car routing option to get an estimated travel time. The current page shows the map centered on Singapore but that doesn't matter since the directions tool accepts text inputs. The next step is to open the directions interface by clicking the "Find directions between two points" control (element [167]).

The user's goal is to determine if the AMC theatre in Pittsburgh can be reached within one hour by car from Hobart Street. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with Car mode selected and OSRM as the routing engine. The "From" field is correctly set to a full Hobart Street address in Pittsburgh, and the "To" field is set to "AMC Waterfront 22, Homestead, PA" and is currently focused. To obtain the travel time, I need to trigger the route calculation. On OSM, pressing Enter in the destination field initiates routing. Since the fields are appropriately filled and focused, the next best action is to press Enter on the "To" field to compute the car route and display the travel time, which I’ll use to determine if it’s within one hour.

The user asks whether an AMC theatre in Pittsburgh can be reached within one hour by car from Hobart Street. On the current OpenStreetMap directions page, the “From” field is set to “Hobart Street, Squirrel Hill South, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15217, United States” and the “To” field is set to “AMC Waterfront 22, Waterfront Drive West, The Waterfront, West Homestead, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15120, United States.” The routing mode is Car with OSRM. The directions summary shows Distance: 5.2km and Time: 0:09. Since 9 minutes is well within one hour, the correct response is “Yes.” I should provide a concise answer including the time and distance, using the specified formatting (no space in km, and keeping the time format 0:09). The best next action is to send this message to the user via send_msg_to_user.
