The user wants to see all customers. In Magento Admin, the "All Customers" list is under the CUSTOMERS menu. On the dashboard, the left navigation includes a "CUSTOMERS" menu item. The next logical step is to click "CUSTOMERS" to open its submenu, where I can then select "All Customers". I will perform a single click action on the CUSTOMERS link to expand it.

✅ Current Progress: Expanded the left navigation “CUSTOMERS” menu; the submenu is now visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is still on the Dashboard, but the visible “CUSTOMERS” submenu is on the critical path to the goal “Show all customers.” Relevant elements:
- link “All Customers” (id: 214) under the vertical menu (id: 212); visible and clickable.
- Other submenu links: “Now Online” (id: 217), “Login as Customer Log” (id: 220), “Customer Groups” (id: 223); visible and clickable, but not required for the goal.

The user's goal is to "Show all customers." On the Magento Admin dashboard, the left navigation menu is open with the CUSTOMERS section expanded, displaying a vertical submenu. Within this submenu, there is a visible and clickable link labeled "All Customers" (bid 214). Clicking this should navigate to the All Customers grid page where all customers are listed. This directly aligns with the user's request, so the next optimal step is to click the "All Customers" link.
