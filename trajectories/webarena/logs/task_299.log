The user wants to display the most recent cancelled order page. From the homepage, the proper path is to go to My Account and then My Orders to access order history. On this site, there is a visible "My Account" link in the top banner (element [227]). The first step is to click "My Account" to enter the account area, where I can then navigate to My Orders, filter or identify cancelled orders, and open the most recent cancelled one. I will start by clicking the My Account link.

The user wants to display the most recent cancelled order page. On the current "My Account" page, there is a "Recent Orders" table listing multiple orders. I need to identify the most recent order with the status "Canceled" and open its order page. In the table, the first row shows Order #000000170 dated 5/17/23 with the status "Canceled" and contains a "View Order" link specifically within that row. Since this is the only visible cancelled order and it appears first (most recent), clicking its "View Order" link (element [1553]) should take me to the cancelled order’s detail page. I should avoid using search or scrolling and directly click the "View Order" link for the cancelled order.
