The user asks for the number of reviews that mention the term "satisfied". Based on the task tips, all reviews can be found via MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews. From there, I can use filters to search for reviews containing a keyword. Currently, we are on the Magento Admin Dashboard page. The horizontal navigation bar includes a "MARKETING" link [226]. The next logical step is to click "MARKETING" to open its submenu, where I can navigate to "User Content" > "All Reviews". Once on the All Reviews page, I will look for a Filters option to search within review content for "satisfied". So the first action is to click the MARKETING menu item to open its options.
