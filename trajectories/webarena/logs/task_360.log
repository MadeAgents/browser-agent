🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to find products for order 148. The “Orders” table [1474] shows multiple rows but not order 000000148 on the current page (visible examples include order numbers [1485] 000000170, [1496] 000000189, [1507] 000000188). Each row has an associated “View Order” link (e.g., [1491], [1502], [1513]) that opens the order details. Pagination controls are visible below the table (links labeled “1 2 3 …”, with text “Items 1 to 10 of 37 total” and “Show 10 per page”), which are relevant to navigate to older orders where 000000148 should appear. Global search [380] with disabled button [385] is unrelated to the goal.
