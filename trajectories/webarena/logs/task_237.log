The user asks for the nearest gas station from CMU. Per Task Tips, ambiguous location names should default to the one in Pittsburgh, PA (Carnegie Mellon University). I'm on the OpenStreetMap homepage with the search box focused. The best initial step is to search for "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" to center the map on CMU. After locating CMU, I can either search for "gas station" or visually inspect nearby POIs at higher zoom; since scrolling is not supported but zoom controls are present, centering first is essential. The search field [162] is focused; I should fill it with the query and then click "Go" subsequently. The next single action will be to fill the search input with the CMU query.

✅ Current Progress: Entered “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” into the OpenStreetMap search box, preparing to center the map on CMU.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is relevant to the goal (finding the nearest gas station to CMU). Key interactive elements:
- Textbox labeled “Search” (node [162]): value set to “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA”, focused, visible.
- “Go” button (node [165]): visible and enabled, will execute the search to center the map on CMU.
- “Find directions between two points” link (node [167]): visible; not necessary for locating nearby gas stations at this stage.
- Map controls: “Zoom In” (node [434]) and “Zoom Out” (node [436]) links; “Query features” (node [454]) link—potentially useful after centering on CMU to inspect nearby POIs.
- A “Welcome to OpenStreetMap!” panel is visible with a “Close” button (node [217]); it does not block the search controls.

Goal: Find the nearest gas station from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) using the current OpenStreetMap page. The map is already centered around CMU with a marker, and the search box [162] is visible with the CMU query filled. To locate nearby gas stations efficiently, I should use the search box to query "gas station" which, in OpenStreetMap/Nominatim, will bias results to the current map view. This avoids manually scanning the map for icons and is aligned with the tip to use the search bar rather than scrolling. The next step is to replace the search field contents with "gas station". After that, I will click the "Go" button to execute the search, then review the results and pick the nearest one based on proximity or the list order (which is typically sorted by relevance and distance within the viewport).

To improve relevance and avoid potential bounding-box restrictions that might yield no/limited results, refining the query to "gas station near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" should prompt Nominatim to return targeted results around CMU rather than generic or global matches.

✅ Current Progress:
- Entered “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” into the search box.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is OpenStreetMap’s search/results view. Current results panel shows “No results found,” likely from a previous query; the map is not centered on CMU yet.
- This page is on the critical path once the CMU search is executed to recenter the map; then we can search for nearby gas stations.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Search textbox “Search” [162]: value = “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA”; visible, editable, focused.
  - “Go” button [165]: visible and enabled.
  - Results panel “Search Results” [579]/list [583]: currently shows “No results found” [584].
  - Optional controls: “Find directions between two points” link [167]; Zoom In [434]/Zoom Out [436].

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the “Go” button [165] to execute the CMU search and recenter the map.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page (OpenStreetMap search/results) is on the critical path to locate nearby POIs such as gas stations once CMU is selected/centered.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Search textbox “Search” [162]: value = “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA”; visible, editable, focused.
  - “Go” button [165]: visible, enabled (currently focused).
  - Results panel “Search Results” [585] with live status [590]: shows “Loading...”; no selectable result items yet.
  - Optional controls: “Find directions between two points” [167]; Zoom In [434] / Zoom Out [436]; “Query features” [454].
- Next logical path (once results load): select the CMU result from the “Search Results” panel to center the map on CMU, then use the search box [162] and “Go” [165] to search for “gas station” near the centered view.

Objective: Find the nearest gas station from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) using OpenStreetMap. 
Current state: The search textbox [162] contains "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" and the "Go" button [165] was clicked. The left sidebar shows "Search Results" with a live region indicating "Loading...", meaning the request is in progress but hasn’t populated yet. The map currently appears centered incorrectly (Sierra Leone, “Kamakwe Highway”), so it's important to complete the CMU search first to recenter to Pittsburgh. 

Given the single-action constraint and no scrolling supported, the most practical next step is to ensure the CMU search executes/refreshes so results appear, after which I can select the CMU result and then search for "gas station" nearby. Since the interface shows "Loading...", re-triggering the Go action can help in case the previous request stalled; it’s the only actionable control tied to this search submission.

Plan:
1) Click "Go" to execute/refresh the search for CMU.
2) Once CMU result appears, select it to center the map.
3) Search for "gas station" to list nearby fuel POIs and identify the nearest one.

Proceeding with step 1.

Objective: Identify the nearest gas station to CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) using the OpenStreetMap page.

Repeatedly clicking "Go" hasn't changed the state; per instructions, avoid repeating actions that didn't elicit a response. 

To improve likelihood of getting relevant nearby results, a refined query can be used. In OSM/Nominatim, using the tag keyword “fuel” often yields better results because amenities are tagged as amenity=fuel. Also, sticking to a concise query like “fuel” will bias to the current map view (centered at CMU), aligning with the tip to use the search bar rather than manual scanning. 

Plan:

Goal: Find the nearest gas station from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) using OpenStreetMap and provide its location (ideally a full address with ZIP code from OSM).

Current page: The map is centered around CMU (visible landmarks: Cohon University Center, Gesling Stadium, Forbes Ave, Fifth Ave). The search input is set to “gas station,” and the left sidebar shows “Search Results” with a “Loading...” spinner, indicating the Nominatim query is in progress but results haven’t populated yet. Repeatedly clicking “Go” is discouraged if it didn’t change the state, and we already have a live “Loading...” status, so another “Go” click would be redundant.

Options considered:
- Wait for results: Not possible; must perform one action.
- Refine query again: We already submitted “gas station” with CMU centered; a refinement might not help immediately.
- Use Query features: Requires clicking visible station icons; none are clearly visible at the current zoom level.
- Adjust zoom: Zooming out one level can broaden the visible area to surface nearby gas station icons, enabling us to click one and read its OSM details/address.

Rationale for next action: Clicking “Zoom Out” is a non-redundant action that can reveal nearby gas station icons if they are just outside the current viewport. Once a pump icon appears, I can select it to retrieve the OSM details including the full address (with ZIP code), fulfilling the task. This avoids repeating the “Go” click while the results are still loading.

Next step: Click the “Zoom Out” control to expand the visible area and potentially expose gas station POIs.

Goal: Find the nearest gas station from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) using OpenStreetMap.

Current state: The OpenStreetMap page shows the search panel with “Search Results” and a map currently not centered on Pittsburgh (shows “kamakwe highway”). The CMU result appears in the results list per the accessibility tree, but the screenshot still shows a spinner and the CMU link lacks a visible bid, making it risky to attempt clicking it directly. Repeatedly pressing “Go” hasn’t reliably re-centered the map.

Plan: Use the directions tool to identify the nearest gas station. Clicking “Find directions between two points” (two-arrow icon, bid 167) opens the routing pane where I can set:
- From: Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA
- To: gas station

This approach avoids reliance on the non-clickable search result link and can provide a nearby gas station as a destination, revealing its details. Next best action: open the directions pane by clicking the two-arrow button.

2025-12-18 19:50:32,465 - 4162245 - agent - INFO - Progress summary generated:
✅ Current Progress:
- Opened the Directions panel on OpenStreetMap.
- “Car” routing mode is selected and service is set to OSRM.
- Destination (“To”) is set to Carnegie Mellon University with full address (Pittsburgh, PA 15213).
- Origin (“From”) is currently empty; nearest gas station not identified yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is relevant and on the critical path. The map is centered around CMU and the routing UI is active, suitable for finding the nearest gas station by searching as a destination.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Radio “Car” [173]: checked (enabled, visible).
  - Combobox “Directions services” [182]: value = “OSRM” (enabled, collapsed).
  - Textbox “From” [194]: empty (editable, visible).
  - Textbox “To” [199]: filled with “Carnegie Mellon University, … Pittsburgh, … 15213, United States” (editable, visible).
  - Button “Reverse Directions” [200]: enabled and visible (can swap From/To so CMU becomes the origin).
  - Button “Close” [187]: closes the directions panel (not needed now).
  - Optional: Welcome overlay Close [217] (visible) if it obstructs the view; not blocking the directions inputs.
- To progress toward the goal, use the directions inputs: set CMU as the origin (either enter CMU in “From” [194] or click “Reverse Directions” [200]) and search for a destination like “gas station” in “To” [199] to get nearby results and select the closest.
