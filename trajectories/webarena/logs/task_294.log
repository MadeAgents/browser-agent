The user wants the SSH clone command for the "ChatGPT" repository. From the dashboard, I don't see a repository named "ChatGPT" in the current list. The instructions specify that the global search bar is not working and to instead use the provided search URL format to locate a repository. Therefore, the best next step is to navigate to the GitLab search results for "ChatGPT" using the specified URL pattern. Once on the search results page, I can select the appropriate repository, open its page, access the "Clone" button, copy the SSH command, and paste it into a visible text field (e.g., the filter search box) to read the full command before sending it to the user. For now, the immediate action is to go to the search results for "ChatGPT".

✅ Current Progress: Arrived at the GitLab search results page for “ChatGPT”; the query is entered and results are visible. No repository page has been opened yet, so the SSH clone command has not been retrieved.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward the goal, as it lists candidate repositories named “Chatgpt/ChatGPT”.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - [231] searchbox labeled “Search for projects, issues, etc.” — value set to “ChatGPT”, enabled and filled.
  - [235] button “Search” — visible and enabled.
  - Results under Projects (clickable links, all visible and enabled):
    - [322] link “Byte Blaze / chatgpt_plugin”
    - [357] link “Byte Blaze / Chatgpt”
    - [392] link “Convex Eggtart / Chatgpt”
- To obtain the SSH clone command, the agent will need to open the intended repository’s page from one of the above links; the current search page does not display a clone command.

The user wants the SSH clone command for the "ChatGPT" repository. On the current GitLab search results page, I see three project entries, including "Byte Blaze / Chatgpt", which is likely the intended repository given the user's username is byteblaze. To obtain the SSH clone command, I need to open the repository page where the "Clone" options (SSH/HTTPS) are typically available. From the accessibility tree, the clickable link for the project is identified as [357] "Byte Blaze / Chatgpt". The best next step is to click this link to navigate to the repository page, where I can then locate and extract the SSH clone command.

  - Button labeled “Clone” (dropdown in the repository header) — visible and enabled; this should reveal “Clone with SSH”.
  - [582] link “Add SSH key” — visible and enabled; alert indicates SSH operations require adding an SSH key (“You can't push or pull repositories using SSH until you add an SSH key to your profile.”).

The user wants the SSH clone command for the Chatgpt repository. On the current repository page, there is a “Clone” control visible in the header (accessibility node [837] link 'Clone'). Typically, clicking this opens a dropdown or modal showing both HTTPS and SSH clone options, each with a copy button. To retrieve the SSH command, I should first open this Clone menu. If the SSH URL appears truncated, I can use the copy button and paste it into a text field later to reveal the full command. The alert about needing an SSH key does not prevent viewing the command; it only warns about using SSH without adding a key. The best next step is to click the Clone link to access the SSH clone details.
