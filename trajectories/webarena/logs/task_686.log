The user wants me to create a submission promoting the GitHub repo auth0/angular-storage in the "technology" forum, using the description from the repo itself. On Postmill, creating a post is done via the "Submit" button in the top bar. I need to open the submission form first. From there, I'll likely need to select the correct forum ("technology"), set the title (probably the repo name), and paste the repo description into the Body. Since the current page shows the home feed and the "Submit" button is clearly visible with bid 63, the next logical step is to click "Submit" to open the form. I will handle selecting the forum and content in subsequent actions after seeing the form fields.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “Create submission” form after clicking “Submit”.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is correct for creating a post and is on the critical path toward the goal. Key elements:
- [119] radio “URL” is selected (checked=true).
- [127] URL textbox is visible and empty (needs the repo URL, e.g., https://github.com/auth0/angular-storage).
- [137] Title textbox (required) is visible and currently empty (“Title This field is required.”).
- [142] Body textarea is visible and empty (should contain the repo description).
- [383]/[384] Forum combobox shows “Choose one…” (no forum selected yet; should be set to “technology”).
- [400] “Create submission” button is visible; required fields are not yet satisfied, so submission is not ready.

The user wants me to create a submission in the "technology" forum promoting the GitHub repo auth0/angular-storage and include the description from the repo itself. On the current Create submission page, I see fields for URL (optional), Title (required), Body, and Forum selection. To ensure I use the exact repo description, I should first retrieve it from the GitHub repository page. If I navigate away from the submission form, I might lose my place, so the safer approach is to open a new tab to fetch the description while keeping this form open. After obtaining the description, I’ll return to this tab to fill: Title as "auth0/angular-storage", Body with the exact repo description (and likely include the repo URL as well per Reddit task tips), choose the "technology" forum, and then submit.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the “Create submission” form earlier, but then opened a new tab to fetch the repo description. No fields have been filled yet and no repo description has been retrieved. 

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is a blank tab (axtree shows only RootWebArea, no interactive elements). This is off the critical path for the goal of posting to the “technology” forum. There are no relevant elements visible to interact with on this page.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Navigate to the GitHub repo to obtain the description: go to https://github.com/auth0/angular-storage and copy the repo’s description text.
- If navigation isn’t possible from this blank tab, close it or switch back to the “Create submission” tab and proceed to fill in: URL with https://github.com/auth0/angular-storage, Title as “auth0/angular-storage”, Body with the repo description, select the “technology” forum, then click “Create submission”.

The user wants me to create a post in the "technology" forum with the description from the GitHub repo auth0/angular-storage. I have two tabs: Tab 0 has the Create submission form, and the active Tab 1 is a blank page. To accurately include the repo description, I should retrieve it directly from the source rather than relying on memory. The best next step is to navigate the currently active blank tab to the GitHub repository page. Once I have the exact description, I can switch back to the Create submission tab to fill in the title "auth0/angular-storage", include the URL and the description in the Body (as per Reddit task tips, place all content including URLs in the Body), select "technology" as the forum, and submit. Therefore, I will navigate to the repository page now.
