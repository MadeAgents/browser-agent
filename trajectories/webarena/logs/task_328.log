The user wants to see listings for "iphone 12 phone case" sorted by price. The most efficient way is to use the site’s search bar rather than navigating categories, per the general tips. On the current homepage, there is a search combobox element labeled [273] with a disabled Search button [278] that likely activates after text entry. The first step should be to enter the query text into the search field. After that, I can submit the search (e.g., by pressing Enter or clicking the now-enabled Search button), and then on the results page, I will look for sort controls to sort by price. For now, I will perform the input action to populate the search field.

The user wants the "iphone 12 phone case" search results shown by price. I’m already on the search results page, which currently shows “Sort By: Relevance.” There’s a “Sort By” combobox (bid 1389) with options including “Price.” The most direct next step is to change the sort criterion from Relevance to Price.

The user wants the "iphone 12 phone case" listings shown by price. I'm already on the search results page for that query, and the Sort By combobox shows "Price" selected. However, the results currently display very high-priced items first (e.g., projectors), which indicates the sort direction is descending. The adjacent control reads "Set Ascending Direction," which implies clicking it will reorder results to ascending price.

The user wants to see the "iphone 12 phone case" listings by price. I’m already on the search results page for that exact query, and the URL confirms sorting by price in ascending order (product_list_order=price and product_list_dir=asc). The page header also shows Sort By: Price with a “Set Descending Direction” link, which indicates the current order is low-to-high. The left sidebar shows “Now Shopping by: Category: Cases, Holsters & Sleeves,” so results are narrowed to the relevant category. Therefore, I should present the first page of results, listing each item with its price in the current ascending order. No further navigation is necessary; the best next step is to send the user a concise list of the current 12 items with their prices, and note that there are 456 total results, offering to refine further if needed.

The user wants to see the "iphone 12 phone case" listings by price. I’m already on the search results page for that exact query, and the URL confirms sorting by price in ascending order (product_list_order=price and product_list_dir=asc). The page header also shows Sort By: Price with a “Set Descending Direction” link, which indicates the current order is low-to-high. The left sidebar shows “Now Shopping by: Category: Cases, Holsters & Sleeves,” so results are narrowed to the relevant category. Therefore, I should present the first page of results, listing each item with its price in the current ascending order. No further navigation is necessary; the best next step is to send the user a concise list of the current 12 items with their prices, and note that there are 456 total results, offering to refine further if needed.

The user wants to see the “iphone 12 phone case” listings organized by price. The current page is already the search results for that query, with the URL showing product_list_order=price and product_list_dir=asc (ascending). The “Sort By” combobox indicates “Price” is selected, and the “Set Descending Direction” link confirms we’re currently in ascending order (low to high). The sidebar shows “Now Shopping by: Category: Cases, Holsters & Sleeves,” so results are narrowed to phone cases.

Given the task to “show” the listings by price, the best next step is to present the visible first page (Items 1–12 of 456) with their names and prices in the current order. No additional navigation or filtering is necessary unless the user requests stricter filtering to only iPhone 12. I will send the user a concise, itemized list of the 12 products and their prices, noting that the entire result set is larger.

The user asked to "Show me the 'iphone 12 phone case' listings by price." I am already on the search results page for that exact query, and the URL parameters confirm sorting by price ascending (product_list_order=price, product_list_dir=asc). The Sort By control shows "Price" with a "Set Descending Direction" link, confirming the current order is low-to-high. The sidebar shows "Now Shopping by: Category: Cases, Holsters & Sleeves," so the results are case-related. The best next step is to present the visible first page (Items 1–12 of 456) with their names and prices in the current ascending order to fulfill the request to show listings by price. I will send the user an itemized list of the 12 products and their prices, and offer to refine to only iPhone 12-specific items if desired.
