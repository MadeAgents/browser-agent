The user wants me to find a forum (subreddit equivalent on this site) focused on ML/DL/NLP and post their question. I'm already on the "Create submission" page with fields for Title, Body, and a required Forum combobox. According to the task tips, choosing the right forum is essential; likely "MachineLearning" is appropriate. I should first open the Forum combobox to see available options, then select a relevant ML forum (e.g., MachineLearning). After that, I'll fill the Title and Body with the exact user-provided text: "what is the SOTA web navigation agent repo", ensuring case sensitivity and leaving the URL field empty as instructed. The immediate next step is to click the Forum combobox to open the menu so I can select an ML-related forum.
