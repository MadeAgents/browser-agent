🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward generating a sales order report. In the Reports overlay:
- Menu category “Sales” is visible.
- Link “Orders” (id/index: [383]) is visible and clickable (enabled).
- Other Sales report links (e.g., “Tax” [386], “Invoiced” [389], “Shipping” [392], “Refunds” [395], “Coupons” [398]) are also visible but not directly needed for the sales order report.
- The top navigation “REPORTS” link (index [339]) is focused; the overlay menu (indices [344], [376]) is open and accessible.

No deviation detected; proceeding to “Sales > Orders” [383] is the appropriate next step toward the goal.
