The user asks for the closest national park to Vinalhaven, ME and the biking time to get there. On OpenStreetMap, I should first search for Vinalhaven, ME using the search bar to center the map there. Then, I will use the directions feature (two-arrow icon) to set the start as Vinalhaven, ME and the destination as Acadia National Park (the only national park in Maine and likely the closest). I will select bicycle mode to get the travel time. For now, the search box is focused (bid 162), so the next step is to enter "Vinalhaven, ME" and then I'll click Go in the following step.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The OpenStreetMap page is relevant for determining the closest national park and estimating bike travel time. Key interactive elements:
- Textbox labeled “Search” (id: [162]) — filled with “Vinalhaven, ME”, focused.
- “Go” button (id: [165]) — visible and likely enabled to run the search.
- “Find directions between two points” link (id: [167]) — visible; can be used to set start/end points and select bicycle routing.
- “Close” button (id: [217]) — visible; can dismiss the welcome panel if it obstructs interaction.
The map currently appears not centered on Vinalhaven yet; submitting the search should move the view and enable directions from Vinalhaven to nearby national parks (e.g., Acadia National Park).

  - Textbox “To” (id [199]) — empty; editable, visible (needs the destination national park).
- Controls:
  - Button “Reverse Directions” (id [200]) — visible/enabled (currently focused).
  - Button “Close” (id [187]) and welcome panel “Close” (id [217]) — visible but not required.

No deviation detected; the interface is correctly prepared to input the nearest national park (e.g., Acadia National Park) as the destination and compute bicycle travel time.

The user needs the closest national park to Vinalhaven, ME and the biking time to get there. On the OpenStreetMap directions page, the routing panel is open with Bicycle mode already selected. The “From” field is filled with “East Main Street, Vinalhaven, Knox County, Maine, 04863, United States,” and the “To” field is currently empty. The closest national park to Vinalhaven is Acadia National Park (the only national park in Maine). To compute the cycling route and time, the next step is to enter “Acadia National Park” into the “To” textbox. After that, I can trigger the route calculation (likely by pressing Enter) and read the result. Since only one action is allowed per step, I will first fill the “To” field.
