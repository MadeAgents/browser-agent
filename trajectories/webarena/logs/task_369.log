 <think>
The user wants to pull up the description page for Carnegie Music Hall using the OpenStreetMap interface. The best path is to use the search bar rather than trying to navigate the map manually, per the general tips. The search textbox is already focused (element [162]). I will enter "Carnegie Music Hall, Pittsburgh, PA" to disambiguate, since there may be multiple Carnegie Music Halls (e.g., Homestead), and the instructions recommend specifying the one in Pittsburgh, PA when names are ambiguous. After entering the query, the next step will be to click the "Go" button to display search results, then select the appropriate result and open its details page. For now, I'll perform the first step: filling the search field.

✅ Current Progress: Entered the query “Carnegie Music Hall, Pittsburgh, PA” into the Search field.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap and directly relevant to the goal. Key elements:

- Button “Go” (node [165]) is visible next to the search field and appears ready to trigger the search.
- A welcome overlay is present with a “Close” button (node [217]); not strictly required for search but can be closed if it obstructs results.
Other nearby controls (e.g., “Find directions between two points” link [167], “Query features” [454]) are not needed at this stage.

The user's goal is to pull up the description page for Carnegie Music Hall on OpenStreetMap. The search field is already populated with "Carnegie Music Hall, Pittsburgh, PA" and focused (element [162]). The next logical step is to execute the search by clicking the "Go" button (element [165]), which should display search results and then allow me to select the correct result to open its details/description panel. The welcome overlay is present but doesn't obstruct the "Go" button. I will click "Go" to proceed.
