The user wants the most expensive product within the Household Supplies category. I’m already on the category page (“Household Supplies Items 1-12 of 277”). To surface the most expensive item efficiently, I should sort the listing by price and then set descending order. The interface provides a “Sort By” combobox currently set to “Position” (bid 1390) with options including “Price,” and there’s also a “Set Descending Direction” link (bid 1394). Following best practices, the first step is to change the Sort By to “Price.” Once that is applied (the page may refresh or reorder), I can then set descending direction to show the most expensive first. Since only one action is allowed at a time, I will first select “Price” in the Sort By combobox.
