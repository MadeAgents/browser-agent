The user wants the date of their first purchase. To find this, I should navigate to their account section, then access order history (My Orders) and identify the earliest order date. On the current homepage, there is a "My Account" link in the top banner (accessibility id 227). The next logical step is to click "My Account" to reach the account dashboard where I can then look for "My Orders."

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “My Account” dashboard. The “Recent Orders” section is visible, showing a table of recent orders with dates.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly relevant to the goal of finding the date of the first purchase. Key elements:
- Link “View All” (id: 1530), visible and enabled — likely leads to the full order history.
- Table “Recent Orders” (id: 1534), visible — contains a Date column and per-row “View Order” action links (visible in the screenshot’s Action column).
Observations from the table: Multiple orders with dates are listed; the earliest visible date in this table appears to be 3/11/23. To ensure accuracy for “first purchase,” the complete order history should be checked via “View All.”

✅ Current Progress: Reached the “My Orders” page showing the full order history table. Dates for multiple orders are visible, but the earliest (first purchase) date has not yet been identified.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly relevant and on the critical path to the goal.
- Table “Orders” (id: 1474) is visible with columns:
  - “Order #” (columnheader id: 1478)
  - “Date” (columnheader id: 1479)
  - “Order Total” (columnheader id: 1480)
  - “Status” (columnheader id: 1481)
  - “Action” (columnheader id: 1482)
- Example visible rows include date cells:
  - gridcell id: 1486 — “5/17/23”
  - gridcell id: 1497 — “5/2/23”
  - gridcell id: 1508 — “5/2/23”
- Per-row action links are available and enabled (e.g., “View Order” link ids: 1491, 1502, 1513).
- To determine the first purchase date, the oldest order in this list must be located. The “Date” column header (id: 1479) is the relevant control if sorting is supported; otherwise, use the pagination controls below the table (visible in the screenshot) to navigate to the last page and read the oldest date.

The user wants the date of their first purchase. On the “My Orders” page, the orders table shows items 1–10 of 37 total, indicating there are multiple pages.

In the pagination controls, I see links for Page 2 (bid 1606), Page 3 (bid 1610), and Page 4 (bid 1614), plus a “Next” link. Clicking “Page 4” should display the oldest orders (items 31–37), allowing me to read the earliest date. The next step is to click the “Page 4” link.

- Visible “Date” cells include:

  - gridcell 1497 — “5/22/22” (visible)
  - gridcell 1508 — “4/27/22” (visible)

- Per-row action links (“View Order” ids 1491, 1502, 1513) are enabled, but not required to identify the date.
- The pagination indicator shows “Items 31 to 37 of 37 total,” confirming this is the oldest segment; the first purchase date should be the smallest date in this page’s “Date” column (likely the last row). No deviation detected.

The user asks for the date of their first purchase. We are on the "My Orders" page, specifically on page 4, which the UI indicates as "Items 31 to 37 of 37 total" and "You're currently reading page 4." This suggests this page contains the oldest orders. I examined the Date column for the seven rows displayed:
