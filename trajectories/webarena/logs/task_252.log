The user wants the coordinates of "Tokyo Japanese Food Store" in Pittsburgh, in decimal degrees (DD). We are on OpenStreetMap with the search textbox focused. The best approach is to use the search bar to find the specific place. Once results appear, I can select the correct listing and then obtain coordinates (either from the URL, the share panel, or any coordinates display associated with the point). First step: enter a clear query including the city to ensure we find the correct place in Pittsburgh, then press Go.

✅ Current Progress: Entered the search query “Tokyo Japanese Food Store, Pittsburgh, PA” into the OpenStreetMap search box.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap and is on the critical path to find coordinates. Key elements:
- Textbox labeled “Search” (id/index [162]): value is “Tokyo Japanese Food Store, Pittsburgh, PA”; focused; visible and editable.
- Button “Go” (id/index [165]): visible and enabled; pressing it should execute the search.
- Button “Close” (id/index [217]): closes the welcome overlay; optional if it obstructs interactions.
- Links/tools that may later help extract coordinates once the place is selected: “Share” (id/index [448]), “Query features” (id/index [454]).

The task is to find the coordinates of "Tokyo Japanese Food Store" in Pittsburgh in decimal degrees (DD). I already entered the query into the OpenStreetMap search box. The next logical step is to trigger the search by clicking the "Go" button. The welcome overlay is present but the search bar and Go button are visible and should be interactable. After initiating the search, I can select the result and then extract coordinates from the place page (often visible on the page or via the Share panel). For now, I will execute the search.

The user asked for the coordinates of Tokyo Japanese Food Store in Pittsburgh in decimal degrees. The OpenStreetMap page shows the search results and a marker placed at the store location. To ensure I retrieve the precise coordinates tied to the specific feature (not just the current map center), the best next step is to click the search result entry for the store: “Tokyo Japanese Food Store, 5855, Ellsworth Avenue, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, …”. This typically leads to the feature’s detail view or centers the map exactly on the feature, making it easier to access accurate coordinates via the place page or the Share panel thereafter.

The user wants the coordinates (in decimal degrees) of Tokyo Japanese Food Store in Pittsburgh. I’m currently on the OpenStreetMap feature page for “Way: Tokyo Japanese Food Store (167278405)”, with the polygon highlighted on the map. The left panel shows tags and details but not coordinates. The most straightforward way to obtain precise lat/long in DD on OSM is to use the “Share” control, which opens a dialog that displays the current map center (and, if a marker is included, the marker’s) coordinates in decimal degrees. From there I can read off the latitude and longitude. Therefore, the next step is to click the “Share” button on the map toolbar to open the share dialog and expose the coordinates.
