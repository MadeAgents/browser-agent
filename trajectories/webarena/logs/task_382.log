The user wants to find nearby USCIS relative to Carnegie Mellon University and then the walking distance to the nearest Social Security Administration from that USCIS. I should start by centering the map on Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA using the search bar available on OpenStreetMap. The search textbox [162] is focused, and the 'Go' button [165] is next to it. The first step is to input "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" into the search field to locate CMU. After this, I will click Go in a subsequent step, review the results, and then search for "US Citizenship and Immigration Services" nearby. Finally, I will use the directions tool to compute walking distance from the identified USCIS to the nearest Social Security Administration office.

The task requires locating Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), then finding the nearby US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and finally determining the walking distance from that USCIS to the nearest Social Security Administration (SSA). The search box [162] is already filled with "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" and focused. The next logical step is to initiate the search by clicking the "Go" button [165], which should center the map and open the results panel for CMU. After that, I can search for "US Citizenship and Immigration Services" near CMU and then use the directions tool to compute the walking distance from USCIS to the nearest SSA. The welcome overlay likely won't prevent the search results from appearing since the search function is part of the persistent header, but if it does, I can close it later. For now, the best immediate action is to click "Go".

- Replace the [199] “To” field with “USCIS Pittsburgh Field Office” to obtain a resolvable destination.

The user’s goal has two parts:
1) Identify the nearby USCIS relative to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).
2) Find the walking distance from that USCIS to the nearest Social Security Administration (SSA).

We’re on OpenStreetMap with the Directions panel open. The “From” field [194] is already set to CMU, and the “To” field [199] is set to “USCIS Pittsburgh Field Office.” Previously, an attempt with a broader USCIS query failed, but we refined the destination text. To proceed, the directions need to be computed. On OSM, entering the fields often requires pressing Enter in the destination field or otherwise submitting to trigger geocoding and route calculation. I should now trigger the route calculation by pressing Enter on the “To” field. This will (a) resolve the USCIS destination and (b) likely display the route. After that, I can switch tasks to compute walking distance from the resolved USCIS to the nearest SSA.

Given only one action is allowed, the best next step is to press Enter on the “To” field [199] to initiate routing to “USCIS Pittsburgh Field Office.”

Goal: Provide the nearby USCIS to Carnegie Mellon University and then compute the walking distance from that USCIS to the nearest Social Security Administration (SSA).

Current page state: We’re on OpenStreetMap’s Directions page. The route is already set from CMU (From [194]) to “USCIS Pittsburgh Field Office, South Side, 3000 Sidney Street…15203, United States” (To [199]). The route shows driving distance: 4.5km, 0:07. This satisfies identifying a nearby USCIS relative to CMU; the full address is visible in the To field.

Next step: Find walking distance from that USCIS to the nearest SSA. For that, I need the USCIS to be the starting point (From) and then set the destination to “Social Security Administration,” and switch to Foot mode. The clean way to make USCIS the origin is to click “Reverse Directions” [200], which will swap the fields (From becomes the current To). Then I can change the To to “Social Security Administration” and later switch mode to Foot.

- From [194]: “USCIS Pittsburgh Field Office, South Side, 3000 Sidney Street, ... 15203, United States”
- To [199]: “Social Security Administration” (generic text entered)
- Current route summary shows Distance 3.7km, Time 0:07, which indicates car mode is active (Car radio [173] checked). The step list looks like a car route.

To get the walking distance, I should switch the mode to Foot. The Foot radio [179] is visible and unchecked. Clicking it should recalculate the route using pedestrian routing from the USCIS origin to whichever SSA the geocoder resolved (likely the nearest SSA to the origin), yielding walking distance and time. This aligns with the task of getting walking distance. If needed, I can refine the SSA selection after switching modes, but the immediate next action is to select Foot mode.

The user wants: (1) the nearby USCIS relative to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), and (2) the walking distance from that USCIS to the nearest Social Security Administration (SSA). I’ve already navigated to OpenStreetMap’s Directions panel. The “From” field is set to “USCIS Pittsburgh Field Office, 3000 Sidney Street, South Side Flats, Pittsburgh, PA 15203, United States”, confirming the nearby USCIS to CMU. The “To” field is “Social Security Administration”. Currently, the route summary shows Distance 3.7km, Time 0:07 — that’s clearly car mode (Car radio is checked). I attempted to click the Foot mode radio button [179], but the attempt failed because a label element for “Car” was intercepting pointer events. To switch to walking without fighting pointer interception, I can use a keyboard-based action on the Foot radio element: focus it and toggle it with the Space key. The press action both focuses the target element and sends the key input, which should select the Foot mode and trigger recalculation of the route for walking. This is the most direct next step toward obtaining the requested walking distance.

The current route is set to Foot mode, with the origin correctly at “USCIS Pittsburgh Field Office, 3000 Sidney Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15203.” However, the destination “Social Security Administration” has resolved to “Social Security Administration, 180 Knights Way, Fond du Lac, WI 54935,” producing a 986km walking route, which is clearly not the nearest SSA to the USCIS origin in Pittsburgh.

The user needs two things:

The route summary shows Distance 4.7km and Time 1:03, which is the walking distance/time between the two.

To complete the task, I should provide the nearby USCIS full address (including ZIP code) and the walking distance in the exact format requested (no space between number and unit), and optionally include the SSA destination details for clarity.
