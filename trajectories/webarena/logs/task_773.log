The user wants me to delete all pending negative reviews. In Magento Admin, reviews management is under the Marketing menu, specifically Marketing > User Content > All Reviews. From the Dashboard page, I should first navigate to the Marketing section. The accessibility tree shows a "MARKETING" link with bid 226 in the top navigation menubar. Clicking that will open the Marketing menu where I can access the reviews list. From there, I'll look for filters to find pending reviews and identify negative ones (likely low-star ratings) to delete. For now, the best next action is to click the Marketing menu.

The goal is to delete all pending negative reviews. I’m already on the Pending Reviews grid and have successfully selected all 3 records using the “Select Visible” option; the status confirms “3 selected.” The next step in Magento’s mass action workflow is to choose the appropriate action from the “Actions” dropdown. The combobox [716] shows options “Delete” and “Update Status.” To proceed with deletion, I need to select “Delete.” This will likely trigger a confirmation modal or apply button which I can handle in a subsequent step, but first I need to select the action.
