The user's goal is to update the project's site title to "GIVE ME SPACE". Given we're on a GitLab repository page listing files, the "index.html" file is likely the site entry point where the HTML <title> tag resides. To change the site title, I should open "index.html", then use the edit function to modify the <title> element to "GIVE ME SPACE", and commit the changes to the main branch (as per the tips: commit to main unless otherwise specified).

First step: click the "index.html" file in the file list to view its contents, which will present an "Edit" button to modify the file. I will click the "index.html" link from the files table.

The task is to update the site's title in index.html to "GIVE ME SPACE" and commit the change. I am on the "Edit file" page with the code editor focused (element [1258]) showing the HTML, including the current <title>gimmiethat/space</title>. Since the editor is a monaco-like code editor, directly replacing the entire content via "fill" risks truncating the file. A safer approach is to locate the title text and edit just that part. The best next step is to open the find dialog within the editor so I can search for the title text and then replace it, eventually committing the changes.

The goal is to change the HTML <title> to "GIVE ME SPACE" and commit. I’m on the Edit file page for index.html, and the Monaco editor shows "<title>gimmiethat/space</title>". The Find panel is already open with "gimmiethat/space" and indicates 1 of 1 match, which highlights the title. To efficiently change it, I should use the Replace functionality in the Find panel. The "Toggle Replace" button (bid 1867) is currently collapsed (expanded=False). Clicking it will reveal the Replace input field, allowing me to enter "GIVE ME SPACE" and perform the replacement. This is the necessary next step before committing the change.
