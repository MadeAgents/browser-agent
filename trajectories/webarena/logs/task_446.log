The user wants me to assign an issue regarding "404" in the a11yproject to Roshanjossey. I'm currently on the Projects dashboard. I can see the project "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" listed with link element [361]. To assign an issue, I first need to navigate into this project, then go to its Issues tab, find the specific issue related to "404", open it, and set the assignee to "Roshanjossey". The most immediate next step is to click into the project. I will click the project link [361] to open its project page where I can access the Issues section.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “a11yproject.com” project page on GitLab. No issue has been opened yet and no assignment has been made.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is on the critical path toward the goal, as it’s the project overview for “The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com.” Relevant interactive elements to proceed:
- Project navigation link “Issues” (node [332], visible/enabled, shows count “42”) — this should lead to the project’s issue list where the 404-related issue can be found and assigned.
- Top navbar “Issues” (node [183], visible/enabled) — broader scope; may list issues across projects and is less precise than the project-specific link.
- Search textbox “Search GitLab” (node [146], visible, empty) — could be used to search for “404” but project-level Issues filtering is preferable.

The goal is to assign an issue related to "404" within the a11yproject repository to the user Roshanjossey. I'm currently on the project's overview page for "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com". To proceed efficiently, I should navigate to the project-specific Issues section rather than the global Issues list. In the left sidebar under Project navigation, there is a link labeled "Issues" with a count of 42 (element [332]). Clicking this will take me to the issues list for this repository, where I can then search/filter for "404" and assign the issue accordingly. This is the most direct next step.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the project-specific Issues list for “The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com.” No 404-related issue has been opened yet and no assignee has been set.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal. You are on the project’s Issues page (title: “Issues · The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com · GitLab”) showing open issues.
- Tabs in main area:
  - “Open 42” tab [600] is selected (visible/enabled).
  - “Closed 570” tab [604] and “All 612” tab [608] are available (visible/enabled) for broader search if needed.
- Issue search/filter:
  - A search/filter textbox with placeholder “Search or filter results...” is visible near the top of the issue list (empty). This is the most relevant control to locate the 404-related issue quickly.
  - Global search textbox “Search GitLab” [143] is also available but less precise than the issue-level filter.
- Issue list:
  - Issue titles appear as links in the list (visible/enabled). You’ll need to locate the item whose title mentions “404” and open it to access assignee controls.
- Other controls present but not needed yet:
  - “Edit issues” button [640] (bulk edit).
  - “New issue” link [642] (not required for assigning an existing issue).
  - “Export as CSV” [622], “Import issues” [625] (irrelevant to assignment).

The user wants to assign the 404-related issue in the a11yproject to Roshanjossey. I’m on the project’s Issues list, and I can see an issue titled “404 for many URLs” (Issue #1535). It is currently assigned to “Byte Blaze.” To change the assignee, the most straightforward approach is to open the specific issue page where the assignee control is available. From there, I can modify the assignee to “Roshan Jossy” (the UI shows this display name, which likely corresponds to the username “Roshanjossey”). The next best action is to click the issue link “404 for many URLs” to open it.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the repository’s Issues list and attempted to open the 404-related issue (“404 for many URLs”). No assignment has been changed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page shows no usable UI (AX tree only has RootWebArea; screenshot is blank), suggesting the target issue page did not load correctly. This is off the critical path because there are no interactive elements available to assign the issue.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Use the browser Back action to return to the project’s Issues list, then open the issue titled “404 for many URLs.”
- Once the issue page loads, use the Assignee control to set the assignee to “Roshanjossey” (Roshan Jossy). If the page fails to load again, refresh and retry opening the issue.
