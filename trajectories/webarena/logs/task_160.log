The user needs a storage option for 6 Nintendo Switch game cards. The quickest way to find relevant products on this site is to use the search bar rather than scrolling through unrelated categories, as per the general tips. I see a search combobox labeled "Search" with bid [273]. The search button [278] is currently disabled, which likely enables after entering text. I will type a targeted query like "Nintendo Switch game card case" to bring up relevant results. After this, I can submit the search (likely by pressing Enter or clicking the now-enabled Search button) and then review product options that fit at least 6 cards, selecting the best one.

The user wants the best storage option to fit all 6 Nintendo Switch game cards. On the current search results page, I see a mix of products, many with large capacities (24, 160), and some unrelated items. To efficiently find a compact case specifically for 6 cards, it's better to refine the search query to include “6” rather than browsing thousands of results. There is a visible search combobox [275] that currently contains "Nintendo Switch game card case". I will replace it with a more targeted query "Nintendo Switch 6 game card case" to locate appropriately sized products. After updating the query, I can submit the search in the next step and then evaluate specific product pages for suitability (capacity, portability, price). This aligns with the general tip to use search instead of scrolling and to refine the query.

✅ Current Progress: Refined query has been submitted. Now on the results page for “Nintendo Switch 6 game card case.”

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward finding a 6‑card storage case, but the visible results are largely broad (many items are high‑capacity cases or unrelated accessories). Key actionable elements:
- Results header [1364]: “Search results for: ‘Nintendo Switch 6 game card case’” confirms the correct query.
- Results count text [1382]: “Items 1–12 of 49589” indicates a very large set; additional refinement or targeted selection is needed.
- View mode control: link “View as List” [1380] (enabled/visible) to make product titles easier to scan.
- Sorting: combobox “Sort By” [1388], current value “Relevance” (enabled; can change to “Price” or “Product Name”); toggle link “Set Ascending Direction” [1392] (enabled).
- Search input: combobox “Search” [274] currently set to “Nintendo Switch 6 game card case” (editable; suggestions available). The Search button [279] is presently disabled, which is typical when the query hasn’t changed.
- Related search term links [1397] (“card case switch”), [1399] (“Nintendo Switch game card case”), [1401] (truncated) are available for quick query pivots.
- Product grid: multiple product tiles with clickable product links and enabled “Add to Cart” buttons are visible; however, the first row items shown (e.g., a 24‑slot case and other non‑6‑slot items) do not obviously match the 6‑card requirement. Scanning or filtering is needed to locate an exact 6‑slot case.

The user wants a compact storage case that fits exactly 6 Nintendo Switch game cards. The current search results page is extremely broad (49,589 items) and the visible products mostly have much larger capacities or are unrelated accessories.

The search input combobox is [274], currently set to “Nintendo Switch 6 game card case.” I will update it to “Nintendo Switch 6 slot game card case,” which should enable the Search button and allow me to submit the refined query in the following step. This adheres to the tip of using search/refinement rather than scrolling through thousands of items.

The user wants a compact storage option specifically to fit 6 Nintendo Switch game cards. The current search results page shows a huge number of items (49,754) with many unrelated or larger-capacity cases. To efficiently narrow down to relevant items, applying a category filter is advisable. In the left sidebar under “Shopping Options,” there is a list of categories with counts, including a “Video Games (817 item)” link [1866]. Filtering to the Video Games category should drastically reduce irrelevant results (e.g., phone cases, home goods) and surface Switch accessories like game card cases. This aligns with the general guidance to use filters to narrow results rather than scrolling through thousands of items. After applying this filter, I can further evaluate the first page for any 6-slot cases and, if necessary, refine further or sort, and then open the best product’s page as required by the Nintendo task.

  - Related search terms links [1398] “card case switch”, [1400] “Nintendo Switch game card case”, [1402] (truncated) — none specify “6,” so they won’t narrow to 6-card cases.
- Assessment: The last action broadened the scope (lost prior narrowing). To get to a 6-card case, the query must explicitly include “6” (e.g., “6 slot/6 card”).

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Replace the search text with “Nintendo Switch 6 slot game card case” in the combobox [275].
- Submit the search by pressing Enter while focused on [275] (or click the Search button [280] if it becomes enabled).

✅ Current Progress:
- Arrived on search results for “Nintendo Switch 6 game card case.”
- Entered a refined query including “Nintendo Switch 6 slot game card case,” but it was appended to the existing text and the search has not been re-submitted.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is relevant but still too broad (Items 1–12 of 49,589). Results are not filtered to 6-slot cases.
- Key interactive elements:
  - Search input combobox [275]: value="Nintendo Switch 6 game card caseNintendo Switch 6 slot game card case", focused, visible, expanded; needs a clean query.
  - Search button [280] “Search”: visible/enabled.
  - Sort By combobox [1389]: “Relevance”, enabled.
- This is on the critical path, but the malformed query (concatenated text) prevents narrowing to 6-slot results.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Select all in the search box and replace with “Nintendo Switch 6 slot game card case” (press Control/Meta+A in combobox [275], then type the text).
- Submit the search by clicking the Search button [280] (or press Enter while [275] is focused).

The user needs a compact case that fits exactly 6 Nintendo Switch game cards. I'm on a broad search results page showing 49,589 items, and the search input combobox is currently messy with a concatenated value: "Nintendo Switch 6 game card caseNintendo Switch 6 slot game card case." Submitting this as-is likely keeps results broad. To precisely target 6-slot cases, I should first clean the query. The best next step is to select all text in the search box to prepare for replacing it with a clean query ("Nintendo Switch 6 slot game card case") and then submit in the following step. The combobox [275] is focused, so using ControlOrMeta+a will highlight all text for replacement.

    - [1468] “160-in Cartridge Holder…” — not 6.
    - [1500] “Car Headrest Mount…” — unrelated.
- Next step on this page will be to narrow results (via “Video Games” filter [1866] and/or related term [1405]) or locate and open a product explicitly stating “6 slots” from the grid.

Goal: Help the user find the best storage option to fit all 6 Nintendo Switch game cards and end up on the product page of the chosen item (Nintendo-specific task rule).

Current page: Search results for "Nintendo Switch 6 slot game card case" with many results, including some relevant cases. I need to pick a suitable product and open its product page. Among visible items:
- HEIYING Game Card Case: 24 game card slots + 24 micro SD slots, $14.69, strong 97% rating with 12 reviews. Portable and clearly fits more than 6 cards, likely a good “best” choice considering price, capacity, and rating.
- Other items include generic holders (unclear capacity), a 160-slot holder (overkill), and unrelated accessories. The HEIYING option stands out as best.

To comply with the Nintendo task rule, I must navigate to the product page of the chosen item. The product title link is bid [1419]. I will click that to open the product page, then I can summarize why it fits the user’s needs.

Plan: Click the HEIYING product title link to open the product details page.
