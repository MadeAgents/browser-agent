 <think>
The user wants to create a new private project named "llm_bulk_inference" and then add members primer, convexegg, and abishek. I'm currently on the Projects Dashboard page, and I can see a "New project" link with accessibility ID [252], which is the appropriate starting point to create a new project. The best next step is to click "New project" to open the project creation form, where I can set the name and visibility (Private). After creation, I will navigate to the project's members area to invite the specified users. For now, I will initiate the project creation flow by clicking the "New project" button.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “Create new project” page in GitLab. No project has been created yet, and no members have been added.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal. Relevant interactive elements:
- [241] link “Create blank project” — visible and clickable.
- [248] link “Create from template” — visible and clickable.
- [255] link “Import project” — visible and clickable.
- [263] link “Show command” — visible and clickable.
The last action attempted to click [252] “Create from template” heading, which is non-interactive; therefore, no progress occurred from that click.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link [241] “Create blank project” to open the form where you can name the project “llm_bulk_inference” and set visibility to Private.
