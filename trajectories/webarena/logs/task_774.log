 <think>
The user wants me to delete all pending reviews with less than 4 stars. From the dashboard, the correct path to manage reviews is typically through the MARKETING menu, specifically under User Content > All Reviews (as noted in the task tips). I need to navigate there first. On the current page, the top navigation bar includes a MARKETING link with accessibility id [226]. The optimal next step is to click MARKETING to access the marketing section where I can locate All Reviews. I will avoid scrolling and external sites, and proceed via the navigation link.

```click("226")```

✅ Current Progress: Opened the Marketing menu from the Dashboard and located the “User Content” section.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is the Magento Admin Dashboard with the Marketing menu overlay open, which is on the critical path to the goal. Relevant interactive elements:
- link “Pending Reviews” (id: 290) — visible, focusable/clickable; this is the primary entry point to manage pending reviews.
- link “All Reviews” (id: 287) — visible, focusable/clickable; secondary, but not necessary for pending-only actions.

No deviation detected; the agent is on track.
