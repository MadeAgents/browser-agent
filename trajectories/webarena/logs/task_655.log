The user wants me to fill out the Contact Us form to request a refund for an iPhone case, including order number #180 and the product SKU. I need the SKU from the user's order history.

The best next step is to click "My Account" to access account details and then navigate to "My Orders" to find order #180 and retrieve the SKU.
