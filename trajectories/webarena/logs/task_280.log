The user wants the full names of chargers from Anker and the price range. The homepage shows many categories and a search bar. Using the search bar is the most efficient way to find "Anker charger" products. I will first type "Anker charger" into the search input (combobox id [386]). After that, I will need to submit the search (likely by pressing Enter), but since only one action is allowed per step, I will start by filling the search field.

The user wants the full names of Anker chargers and the price range of the available models. We’re already on the search results page for “Anker charger,” showing a grid of 12 items. I should extract only actual chargers (wall, wireless, power bank) and exclude cables. From the visible results, the charger items and their prices are clearly listed. I will compile the exact product names and prices for these nine charger products and compute the price range (min and max price across this set). The minimum price visible is $8.99 and the maximum is $59.99, giving a range of $8.99 to $59.99. I will now send this list and the price range to the user in a concise message.

The user wants the full names of Anker chargers and the price range for available models. I’m on the search results page for “Anker charger,” which shows a grid of 12 items. I need to identify which items are actual chargers made by Anker (including wall chargers, wireless chargers, and portable chargers) and exclude cables. From the visible grid, I can extract the full product titles and prices for nine Anker charger items. Then I’ll compute the minimum and maximum prices among those to provide the price range. The visible prices for these chargers range from $8.99 (Anker 313 Wireless Charger Pad) to $59.99 (Anker PowerCore Speed 20000 portable charger). I’ll send the list and the price range to the user in a clear bullet list.

The user wants the full names of Anker chargers and the price range for available models. I’m on the search results page for “Anker charger,” which shows a grid of 12 items. I need to identify which items are actual chargers made by Anker (including wall chargers, wireless chargers, and portable chargers) and exclude cables. From the visible grid, I can extract the full product titles and prices for nine Anker charger items. Then I’ll compute the minimum and maximum prices among those to provide the price range. The visible prices for these chargers range from $8.99 (Anker 313 Wireless Charger Pad) to $59.99 (Anker PowerCore Speed 20000 portable charger). I’ll send the list and the price range to the user in a clear bullet list.

The user wants the full names of Anker chargers and the price range. I’m already on the search results page for “Anker charger,” which lists product titles and prices. I will extract only items that are actual chargers from Anker (wall chargers, wireless chargers, and portable chargers) and exclude cable-only items. From the visible grid (items 1–12), there are nine qualifying Anker charger products with clear titles and prices. I will list those exact names and prices and compute the range by taking the minimum and maximum prices among them ($8.99 and $59.99). Then I’ll send the information to the user in a concise message.

The user wants the full names of Anker chargers and the price range. I’m already on the search results page for “Anker charger,” which shows 12 products with names and prices. From the visible grid, I need to extract only items that are actual chargers from Anker (wall chargers, wireless chargers, and a portable power bank), and exclude cable-only items. 

From the accessibility tree and screenshot, the qualifying chargers and their prices are:
1) Anker USB C Charger 30W, 711 Charger — $29.99
2) Anker USB C Charger 40W, 521 Charger (Nano Pro) — $35.99
3) Anker PowerCore Speed 20000 (portable charger) — $59.99
4) Anker 10W Max Wireless Charger, 313 Wireless Charger (Pad) — $8.99
5) Anker Wireless Charger, 313 Wireless Charger (Stand) — $19.49
6) USB Charger, Anker Elite Dual Port 24W Wall Charger, PowerPort 2 — $13.99
7) iPhone 12 Charger [GaN Tech], Anker 30W Compact USB-C Wall Charger, PowerPort Atom — $29.99
8) USB C Charger, Anker 30W 2 Port Fast Charger, Foldable PowerPort PD 2 — $29.99
9) Anker 40W 5-Port USB Wall Charger, PowerPort 5 — $29.99

I’ll send these full names exactly as shown and include the prices. Then I’ll provide the price range across these available models: minimum $8.99 and maximum $59.99, i.e., $8.99 to $59.99. I’ll deliver this via a single send_msg_to_user action as required.

The user wants the full names of Anker chargers and the price range. I’m already on the search results page for “Anker charger,” which displays a grid of items with product titles and prices. I should extract the items that are actual chargers from Anker and exclude cables. From the visible grid (items 1–12), there are nine Anker charger products with clear titles and prices. I will list their exact names and prices from the page, then compute the price range (minimum and maximum) across those items. The lowest visible price is $8.99 (Anker 313 Wireless Charger Pad) and the highest is $59.99 (Anker PowerCore Speed 20000 portable charger). I will send this list and the price range to the user in a concise bullet list via a single action.

2025-12-17 00:29:34,821 - 429696 - agent - INFO - Progress summary generated:
✅ Current Progress:
- Performed search for “Anker charger” and opened the results page.
- Extracted and sent the full names and prices for the Anker chargers visible on page 1 (grid view), and reported a preliminary price range based on these items ($8.99–$59.99).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- We are on the critical path. The page shows “Search results for: ‘Anker charger’” [1350] with “Items 1–12 of 2527” [1374], indicating many more results exist beyond the first page.
- Key interactive elements to refine and complete the task:
  - Sort control: combobox “Sort By” [1380], value='Relevance', options include 'Price' (expanded=False; enabled).
  - Direction toggle: link “Set Ascending Direction” [1384], enabled (for switching price order).
  - View control: “View as … List” link [1372], enabled (can make titles easier to scan).
  - Search box: combobox “Search” [259], value='Anker charger'; “Search” button [264] is disabled (no need to resubmit now).
- Relevant result items in the grid (examples confirm data is readily extractable):
  - [1398] link “Anker USB C Charger 30W, 711 Charger, …” with price $29.99 (visible).
  - Multiple other charger listings and some non-target cables are present; cables should be excluded when compiling the charger list.
- Gap vs. goal: The provided price range was computed only from the first 12 visible items, not across all available models in the 2527 results. To accurately report the full price range, we should sort by Price and capture the lowest and highest priced Anker chargers across the full results.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Change sorting to price: open combobox “Sort By” [1380] and select option “Price”.
- Ensure ascending order to find the minimum: click link “Set Ascending Direction” [1384]; record the first charger’s price/title (exclude cables). Then toggle the direction again via the same link to capture the maximum-priced charger.
