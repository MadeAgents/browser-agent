The user wants to compare walking vs driving time from Randyland to Carnegie Mellon University. On OpenStreetMap, the best way is to open the directions tool. I see the "Find directions between two points" link (bid 167) near the Go button, which matches the "two arrow" button tip. The first step is to click that to bring up the directions panel where I can then enter the start and end locations and select transport modes to get times.

To proceed toward the goal, the agent needs to enter “Randyland” in From [194] and “Carnegie Mellon University” in To [199], compute the route in Car mode, note the time, then switch to Foot [179] and note the walking time for comparison.

2) If the error persists, select option [184] “GraphHopper” from [182]. After a car route and time appear, switch mode to Foot by clicking radio [179] to get the walking time for comparison.

The goal is to compare walking vs driving times from Randyland to Carnegie Mellon University using the OpenStreetMap directions tool. The From and To fields are correctly populated with the full Pittsburgh addresses. Currently, the Directions panel shows “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” with the routing service set to GraphHopper and Car mode selected. 

Attempts to switch to Foot mode via clicking the radio input failed due to the Car label intercepting pointer events. We already tried Valhalla and GraphHopper; both still yielded the routing error. A sensible next step is to try the third routing service, OSRM, which often has different routing data/availability and may successfully compute a route. Using select_option on the combobox is reliable and avoids any UI overlay issues.

Once OSRM is selected, the system should recalculate the car route. If successful, we can later switch to Foot mode (potentially via a different approach like focusing and pressing a key) to obtain the walking time and compute the difference.

The goal is to compare walking vs driving times from Randyland to Carnegie Mellon University using the OpenStreetMap directions tool. The From and To fields are correctly populated with the full Pittsburgh addresses. Currently, the Directions panel shows “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” with the routing service set to GraphHopper and Car mode selected. 

Attempts to switch to Foot mode via clicking the radio input failed due to the Car label intercepting pointer events. We already tried Valhalla and GraphHopper; both still yielded the routing error.

The task is to compare the difference in time between walking and driving from Randyland to Carnegie Mellon University using the OpenStreetMap directions panel. The panel is already populated with:
- From: Randyland, 1501 Arch Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15212
- To: Carnegie Mellon University, Zebina Way, Pittsburgh, PA 15213

The transport mode Foot is currently selected (radio checked=true), and the routing service is OSRM. The live region shows “Loading...”, indicating the walking route is being calculated. I need the actual travel time text to appear so I can record it and then switch to Car to get the driving time.

Since the UI shows "Loading...", performing a benign UI interaction that doesn’t disrupt the route but triggers a UI update (like expanding the Directions services combobox) can help the environment refresh the accessibility tree so I can read the computed time once it’s ready. Clicking the combobox [182] is safe and won’t clear the inputs, and will likely allow me to see updated results in the next state. After I can read the walking time, I will switch to Car and get the driving time to compute the difference.
