The user's goal is to post the comment "Good idea" on the merge request related to color utility within the a11yproject.com project. I’m currently on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects, and I can see “The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com” at the top with a link element (bid 320). The first step is to navigate into that project. From there, I will look for the Merge requests tab in the project and then locate the merge request about "color utility." Using filters or visually scanning the titles will help identify it quickly. Once I find and open that MR, I’ll add the comment "Good idea" in the discussion/comment box and submit it. For now, I need to click the a11yproject.com project link to proceed.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward posting a comment on the relevant merge request. Key interactive elements:

- Top navigation “Merge requests” (node [187], visible/enabled) — global merge requests, less targeted than the project-level link.
- Search input “Search GitLab” (node [146], empty, enabled, visible) — can be used to search for the MR if needed.

The user's goal is to post a comment "Good idea" on the merge request related to "color utility" within the a11yproject.com project. I’m currently on the project’s main page for The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com. To find the relevant merge request, the fastest path is to navigate to the project-specific Merge requests list rather than the global one. In the left sidebar under Project navigation, there is a link labeled "Merge requests" with count 10 (node [352]). Clicking this should bring up the list of all merge requests in this project, where I can then search or scan for the one related to color utility. Once on that list, I will look for a filter/search field to quickly find "color" or "color utility", open the MR, and then add the comment. The first step is to click the project’s Merge requests link in the sidebar.
