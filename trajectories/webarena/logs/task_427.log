The user wants the page on OpenStreetMap for the university with the most Turing Award winners. Based on common knowledge up to 2022, Stanford University is widely recognized as having the highest number of Turing Award affiliates. To find its page on the map efficiently, I should use the search bar rather than trying to scroll. The Search textbox [162] is already focused. The next step is to input "Stanford University" into the search field, then I can click "Go" afterward to load the relevant results and select the correct page.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap’s main interface, which is appropriate for locating a university’s map page. Key interactive elements:
- Textbox labeled “Search” (id: [162]) — value set to “Stanford University”, focused, visible.
- Button “Go” (id: [165]) — visible and clickable; next step to trigger the search.
- Optional: Button “Close” (id: [217]) — visible; closes the welcome overlay if it obstructs the view.
- Map controls (Zoom In [434], Zoom Out [436], Query features [454]) — visible; useful after navigating to the university page.

No deviation detected; current page and actions align with the goal.
