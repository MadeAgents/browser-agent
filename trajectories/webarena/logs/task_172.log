 <think>
The user wants the full names of repositories they contributed to that have zero stars. On the “Projects · Dashboard” page under “Yours 14,” each project entry shows a role (Owner/Developer/Maintainer) indicating contribution and a set of metric links; the first metric with a star icon represents the star count. I scanned each listed project and identified which have a star count of 0. The entries with zero stars are:
- Byte Blaze / dotfiles
- Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline
- Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme
- Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt
- Byte Blaze / timeit
- Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space
These are all under the Byte Blaze namespace and show "Owner," which qualifies as having made contributions.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the GitLab “Projects · Dashboard” and is directly relevant to the goal. It lists user-associated projects under “Yours 14,” showing role (e.g., Owner/Developer/Maintainer) and per-project metrics including stars. Relevant interactive elements:
- Searchbox labeled “Filter by name” ([269]) — visible and empty.
- Sort button “Most stars” ([273]) — visible and enabled.
- Project heading links (e.g., [320] “The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com”, [357] “Primer / design”, [394] “Byte Blaze / millennials-to-snake-people”, [431] “Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts”) — visible and clickable.
- Per-project metric links showing counts; the first metric corresponds to star count (e.g., [338] “21”, [375] “21”, [412] “6”, [449] “6”) — visible and clickable.
The agent used these visible star counts and roles to identify repos with zero stars where contributions were made.
