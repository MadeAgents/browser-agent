✅ Current Progress: Reached the “Create new project” page in GitLab with options to start a project. No repository has been created yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal of creating an empty repository. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link [241] “Create blank project” — visible; this is the correct option to create an empty repository.
- Link [248] “Create from template” — visible; not aligned with the goal of an empty repo.
- Link [255] “Import project” — visible; not needed for this goal.
The last action clicked heading [252] under “Create from template,” which diverges from creating a blank project.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link [241] “Create blank project” to proceed with setting up an empty repository.

- Project slug (303) is "awesome_program_aided_reasoning"

- The Project URL section shows a button "Pick a group or namespace" (283) between the base URL and a trailing slash, implying no namespace is selected yet. Typically, selecting a namespace is required for project creation.

Before attempting to create the project, I should select the appropriate namespace (likely the personal namespace "byteblaze"). Clicking the namespace picker should open a dropdown/menu to select the namespace. This is the logical next step to ensure the form is complete and avoid submission errors for missing namespace.

  - textbox [273] “Project name” — required, visible; value: “awesome_program_aided_reasoning?”. Helper text says allowed characters are letters, digits, emojis, “_”, “.”, “+”, dashes, or spaces; “?” is not allowed, so current name likely violates validation.

The user’s goal is to create a new empty repository named “awesome_program_aided_reasoning?”.

Additionally, the “Initialize repository with a README” checkbox [343] is currently checked, which would create a non-empty repository, but I should first fix the validation error before toggling the checkbox and submitting. The best immediate step is to update the Project name to a valid string by removing the “?” so it reads “awesome_program_aided_reasoning”.

The goal is to create a new empty repository named "awesome_program_aided_reasoning". We’re on the "Create blank project" form. The "Project name" textbox [272] is now set to "awesome_program_aided_reasoning", which satisfies the character constraints noted by the alert (the prior "?" caused the error). The "Project slug" [300] matches the name. To ensure the repository is empty, we must uncheck "Initialize repository with a README". The checkbox [343] is currently checked, and my last attempt to click it failed because its label [344] intercepted pointer events. In such UIs, clicking the associated label toggles the checkbox. Therefore, the best next step is to click the label [344] to uncheck the README initialization, then we can proceed to create the project.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the GitLab “Create blank project” form.
- Entered a valid Project name and slug: “awesome_program_aided_reasoning” (removed the invalid “?”).
- Ensured the repository will be empty by unchecking “Initialize repository with a README”.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to creating the repository.
- A prior validation alert is present about allowed characters, but the current name complies.
- Relevant elements and state:
  - textbox [272] “Project name” — value: “awesome_program_aided_reasoning”, required, visible.
  - textbox [300] “Project slug” — value: “awesome_program_aided_reasoning”, required, visible.
  - checkbox [343] “Initialize repository with a README” — unchecked (good for empty repo).
  - radio [332] “Public” — checked=true.
  - button [354] “Create project” — visible (no disabled state indicated).
  - namespace picker button [282] under “Project URL” — hasPopup=menu, expanded=false; current selection not shown.

The goal is to create a new, empty repository. We are on the "Create blank project" form. The prior error was due to an invalid character (the question mark) in the project name; it has been corrected, and the Project name textbox now shows "awesome_program_aided_reasoning" (valid). The Project slug also matches and is valid. The "Initialize repository with a README" checkbox is currently unchecked, satisfying the requirement for an empty repository. Visibility is set to Public. The namespace picker appears present but not expanded; typically, GitLab defaults to the personal namespace if none is selected, and earlier we selected byteblaze. Given the form fields are valid and the empty repo requirement is met, the next best action is to submit the form by clicking "Create project".

✅ Current Progress:
- Successfully created a new GitLab project; confirmation alert states: “Project ‘awesome_program_aided_reasoning’ was successfully created.”
- Landed on the project’s overview page showing “The repository for this project is empty,” confirming it was created without initialization files.
- Note: “?” is not allowed in project names; the repository was created as “awesome_program_aided_reasoning” (without the question mark).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path and indicates the goal has been effectively achieved (empty repository created).
- Relevant elements (visible/enabled):
  - Alert [558]: success message for project creation.
  - Heading [566]: “awesome_program_aided_reasoning … Public.”
  - Empty-repo action buttons: “Clone”, “Upload file”, “New file”, “Add README”, “Add LICENSE”, “Add CHANGELOG”, “Add CONTRIBUTING”, and “Configure Integrations” (all visible, indicating no files exist yet).
  - SSH notice [531] with link [534] “Add SSH key” (optional next step for pushing via SSH).
- Breadcrumbs show project under “Byte Blaze” namespace ([544] Byte Blaze > [547] awesome_program_aided_reasoning), consistent with a newly created project.
