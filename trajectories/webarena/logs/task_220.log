The user wants walking distances from nearby hotels to Gardner Steel Conference Center, only those that take at most 5 minutes. On OpenStreetMap, I'll first locate "Gardner Steel Conference Center" using the search bar. Once located, I can use the "Find directions between two points" feature (two arrows) to set the destination to the conference center and then test nearby hotels as starting points in walking mode. I will first search for the conference center to get it centered and identified on the map. The search input [162] is focused, and the "Go" button [165] is visible. The first step is to fill the search field with "Gardner Steel Conference Center" and then click Go in the next step.

Goal: Identify nearby hotels whose walking route to “Gardner Steel Conference Center” is at most 5 minutes, and show the walking distance. We’re on OpenStreetMap with the venue centered and the search results visible. To compute walking times/distances, I should open the routing panel using the “Find directions between two points” (two arrows) control. Then I can set the destination to Gardner Steel Conference Center and try likely nearby hotels (e.g., “Wyndham Pittsburgh University Center”, “The Oaklander Hotel”, “Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh University Place”) as starting points, ensuring the Pittsburgh, PA options. The routing UI will show a walking time and distance; I’ll filter for those with ≤5 minutes and report distances in the required format (no space between number and unit). The next best step is to open the directions panel via the link [167].

The task is to find walking distances from nearby hotels to Gardner Steel Conference Center, filtering for routes that take at most 5 minutes. We’re on the OpenStreetMap directions page with the destination already set to “Gardner Steel Conference Center” and the routing panel open. The current routing mode is Car, but we need Foot to get walking times/distances.

I tried clicking the Foot radio button (bid 179), but the click failed due to the Car label (bid 174) intercepting pointer events, suggesting overlapping UI elements. To avoid UI overlap issues, using the keyboard to change the selected radio option is more reliable. Radio groups usually support ArrowRight/ArrowLeft to move between options when focused. I will focus the Car radio and press ArrowRight once to switch to Bicycle; in the following step, I can press ArrowRight again to switch to Foot. This keeps progress incremental and avoids repeating a failing click action.

Objective: Provide walking distances from nearby hotels to Gardner Steel Conference Center that take at most 5 minutes. We’re already on the OpenStreetMap Directions page with:
- Mode = Foot (walking) confirmed selected (radio [179]).
- Destination (To field [199]) set to Gardner Steel Conference Center.
- From field [194] empty.

Plan:
1) Try likely nearby hotels as the From location and compute walking routes. Candidate hotels in Oakland include “The Oaklander Hotel,” “Wyndham Pittsburgh University Center,” and “Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh University Place.” Based on local knowledge, only the closest might have ≤5 min, but we must verify via OSM routes and then capture the distance for those with walking time ≤ 5 minutes.
2) Start with “The Oaklander Hotel” because it’s among the closest to campus core. Enter it into the From field [194] and then press Enter in a subsequent step if needed to compute the route. We will read the time and distance from the route result panel and decide whether it qualifies (≤5 minutes). If it doesn’t, we’ll try another nearby hotel.

First action now: fill the From field [194] with “The Oaklander Hotel” to initiate the search for that origin. After that, I’ll submit/press Enter to compute the route.

The user wants walking distances from nearby hotels to Gardner Steel Conference Center that take at most 5 minutes. I’ve already:
- Opened the OpenStreetMap Directions panel
- Set transport mode to Foot
- Set “To” as Gardner Steel Conference Center
- Set “From” as The Oaklander Hotel
- Submitted the route, and the live region shows “Loading...”, indicating that the directions are being computed.

To proceed, I need the route summary (time and distance) to appear so I can determine whether this hotel is within 5 minutes and record the walking distance. Since the page is currently loading, the safest non-intrusive next step is to hover over the live status region to allow the UI to update and then read the completed route summary once it’s available.

To reliably change the routing engine, I should use the select_option action on the combobox element (bid 182) to select “GraphHopper,” which should trigger recomputation of the walking route. Once a valid route appears, I can read time and distance and then proceed to identify hotels with ≤5-minute walking times. The immediate next step is to switch the routing engine to “GraphHopper.”

The user wants walking distances from nearby hotels to the Gardner Steel Conference Center that take at most 5 minutes. I have already configured the Directions panel for Foot (walking), and set “From” to The Oaklander Hotel and “To” to Gardner Steel Conference Center. The OSRM engine initially failed to find a route, so I switched the routing engine to GraphHopper via the combobox. To ensure the route calculation is actually triggered and the result (time and distance) appears, the most reliable next step is to submit the current inputs again by pressing Enter on the From field. This should update the live region with the computed walking time and distance, allowing me to determine if it’s ≤5 minutes and capture the distance. After this, I can test additional nearby hotels if needed.

Goal: Find nearby hotels whose walking routes to Gardner Steel Conference Center take at most 5 minutes, and report the walking distance. We’re on the OpenStreetMap directions page. Current state shows:

- “To” set to “Gardner Steel Conference Center, 130, Thackeray Street… 15260, United States.”
- Directions service set to Valhalla.
- The live status region shows “Loading…,” suggesting the route is being computed.

To progress, I need the route summary (time and distance) to appear so I can evaluate whether it meets the ≤5 minutes criterion and capture the walking distance. Triggering a recalculation via Enter on the From field is a safe way to ensure the route is computed with the current settings. Previously, I switched the routing service to Valhalla and observed “Loading…” but haven’t re-submitted the form since then. Pressing Enter now should finalize the route calculation and update the UI, enabling me to read the time and distance in the next step.

The user wants walking distances from nearby hotels to Gardner Steel Conference Center that take at most 5 minutes. I’m on the OpenStreetMap directions page with walking mode (Foot) selected and the “To” field already set to the conference center. The current page shows a blocking modal dialog “Search failed” saying it couldn’t locate “Wyndham Pittsburgh University Center,” which prevents further interaction with the directions form. To proceed, I need to dismiss this modal first. After closing it, I can try other nearby hotels (e.g., The Oaklander Hotel, Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh University Place, Hampton Inn Pittsburgh University/Medical Center) as the “From” location, compute walking routes, and capture distances for those with walking time ≤ 5 minutes. The immediate next action is to click the modal’s Close button.

The user wants walking distances from nearby hotels to Gardner Steel Conference Center, only those ≤5 minutes. I’m on the OpenStreetMap Directions page with mode set to Foot and the destination set to Gardner Steel Conference Center. The current “From” field contains “Wyndham Pittsburgh University Center,” and the directions panel shows “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” To proceed toward the goal, I should try another nearby hotel that’s likely within 5 minutes. “The Oaklander Hotel” is very close to the center of campus and likely within the threshold. Previously, trying “The Oaklander Hotel” failed with some engines, but now the engine is Valhalla which might work. To improve search resolution, I’ll specify the city and state (“Pittsburgh, PA”). The immediate next step is to update the “From” textbox with “The Oaklander Hotel, Pittsburgh, PA” so that in the following step I can submit (press Enter) to compute the route and read the distance/time.

- Directions service currently set to Valhalla.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is relevant and on the critical path to the goal (computing walking time/distance between hotels and the venue).
- Current issue: The directions panel shows “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” No time/distance has been returned yet.
- Relevant interactive elements:

  - Button “Reverse Directions” (id=200, visible/enabled).
- No route summary panel is visible yet; thus no distance/time to evaluate against the ≤5 minutes filter.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Press Enter in the “From” textbox (id=194) to (re)compute the walking route.

Task: Identify nearby hotels whose walking routes to Gardner Steel Conference Center take at most 5 minutes and report their walking distances. We are on the OpenStreetMap Directions page with:
- Mode set to Foot (walking).
- “To” set to Gardner Steel Conference Center (full address).
- “From” currently set to “The Oaklander Hotel, Pittsburgh, PA”.
- Directions services combobox shows Valhalla selected.
- Panel indicates “Couldn't find a route between those two places,” so no distance/time yet.

Given repeated inability to find a route with Valhalla, I should try a different routing engine because engines have different pedestrian network coverages. The combobox (bid 182) supports selecting another option directly. Previously, switching engines has been useful. I will change the engine to GraphHopper to attempt to compute a valid walking route. After switching, if necessary, I can press Enter on the From field in a subsequent step to trigger recalculation. This is the most logical next step toward getting a route and the needed walking distance.
