The goal is to show the route and driving time from Allentown, PA to the city where customer Amanda Kim lives. To do that, I first need to find Amanda Kim’s city in the Magento Admin. The current page is the Magento Admin Dashboard, and the left overlay menu “Customers” is open with the “All Customers” link (bid 214) visible. Clicking “All Customers” will take me to the list of customers where I can search for Amanda Kim and view her city. After identifying the city, I will use the map tool to compute the route and driving time. The immediate next best action is to click “All Customers.”

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page was necessary to find the destination city but does not provide mapping or routing functionality. Key elements:
- Table row for “Amanda Kim” (visible): City column shows “Hoboken”; State/Province shows “New Jersey”.
- Input “Search by keyword” (node [872]): Visible, enabled, currently empty.

The user asked to show the route and driving time from Allentown, PA to the city where their E-commerce customer Amanda Kim lives. I previously identified Amanda Kim’s city as Hoboken, NJ from the shopping admin. The current OpenStreetMap page already shows directions from Allentown, PA to Hoboken, NJ with the car mode selected and the OSRM service. The summary displays Distance: 142km and Time: 1:54, and the turn-by-turn route is visible. Since the route is already displayed and the required driving time is present, the best next step is to provide the concise result to the user, matching the formatting guidelines (distance as “142km” and time as “1:54”).
