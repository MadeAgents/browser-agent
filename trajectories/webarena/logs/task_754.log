My previous attempt to click the Private radio input [770] failed due to the associated label [771] intercepting pointer events. A common workaround is to click the label element itself, which is designed to toggle the associated radio input. Therefore, the best next action is to click the Private label [771] to set the visibility to Private. After that, I can proceed to click “Create project.”

 <think>
The user wants a private NodeJS repository named "web_agent_nodejs" created using an appropriate template. I am on the "Create from template" page, and the "NodeJS Express" template is shown as selected, which matches the requirement for a NodeJS setup to speed development. The "Project name" and "Project slug" fields are both set to "web_agent_nodejs," and the "Visibility Level" is already set to Private (radio [770] is checked). The "Create project" button ([794]) is visible, which is the next action needed to finalize repository creation. Therefore, I should click "Create project" to complete the setup.
