The user wants to set the homepage URL on their GitLab profile to https://helloworld.xyz. Based on the Task Tips, to edit the profile, I should click the profile button on the top right (next to the question mark) and then choose "Edit profile". On the current dashboard page, the top-right header includes a link labeled "Byte Blaze" (node [201]), which likely opens the user profile menu. The first step is to click this "Byte Blaze" link to open the dropdown. After that, I will look for an "Edit profile" option to proceed to the profile settings where I can set the homepage URL. Since only one action is allowed per step, I'll click the profile link now.

The goal is to set the homepage URL on the GitLab profile to https://helloworld.xyz. From the Task Tips, editing the profile is done via the profile button (top-right) and then "Edit profile". The current page is the dashboard with the profile dropdown already expanded (link [201] is expanded=True). Within this dropdown, I can see the "Edit profile" link (node [217]). The next logical step is to navigate to the Edit profile page where the "Website URL" (homepage) field should be available to modify. Therefore, I should click the "Edit profile" link now.
