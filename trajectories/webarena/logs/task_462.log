The task is to increase the product price by 10%. I can see the current Price field value is 18.00 in the [global] Price textbox (bid 985). Per the rules, any calculation must use the calculate() function. So first, I will compute the new price as 18.00 * 1.1. After obtaining the result, in the next steps I will update the price field with the calculated value and then save.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the Magento Admin product edit screen for “Tiberius Gym Tank-L-Yellow,” which is directly on the critical path to increasing the product price.
- Relevant elements:
  - Textbox “[global] Price * $” (id marker: 985) — currently filled with “18.00”, visible and editable.
  - Button “Save” (id marker: 876) — visible and appears enabled.
  - Button “Advanced Pricing” (id marker: 990) — visible; not required for a simple price update.
  - Combobox “Tax Class” (id marker: 997) — set to “Taxable Goods”; not directly relevant to the price change.
No errors or off-track indicators detected. The next action should be to update the Price field to 19.80 and save.

The goal is to increase the product price by 10%. I already calculated the new price: 18.00 * 1.1 = 19.80 using the required calculate() function. Now, on the current product edit page, the Price field is the textbox labeled “[global] Price * $” with bid 985 and currently shows 18.00. The next step is to update this field to 19.80. After successfully updating the field, I will click the Save button to persist the changes in a subsequent action.
