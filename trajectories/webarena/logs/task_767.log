The user wants walking directions ("walkway") from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh to the closest chain grocery owned by a local business. In Pittsburgh, Giant Eagle is a local company and a chain grocery; the closest store to Shady Ave is likely the Shadyside Market District on Centre Ave. To be precise, I should use OpenStreetMap to:
1) Locate "401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh, PA" via the search box.
2) Use the "Find directions between two points" tool to set this as the start and search for nearby "Giant Eagle" (or the specific Shadyside Market District) and pick the closest one, set mode to walking, and get directions.
The search field [162] is focused, so the best immediate action is to enter "401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh, PA" to center the map/address, then proceed to directions in following steps.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap’s main interface, which is appropriate for getting walking directions. Key interactive elements:
- [162] textbox labeled “Search” — value: “401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh, PA”, focused (filled, visible).
- [165] button “Go” — visible and presumably enabled to center/search the entered address.
- [167] link “Find directions between two points” — visible; opens the directions tool to set start/destination and travel mode.
- Other controls (Zoom In [434], Zoom Out [436], Show My Location [439]) are present but not essential right now.
The page is on the critical path to the goal (finding a walking route to the nearest qualifying grocery). No errors or detours detected.

The goal is to get walking directions from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh to the nearest chain grocery that is locally owned.

The search box [162] is already filled with “401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh, PA”. The next step is to click the “Find directions between two points” link [167] (the two arrows icon) to open the A/B directions panel so I can set the start and search for a nearby Giant Eagle/Market District and choose walking mode.

Objective: Get walking directions (walkway) from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh to the closest locally owned chain grocery. In Pittsburgh, Giant Eagle is a locally owned chain. I’ve already set:
- From: “Kenmawr Apartments, 401, Shady Avenue, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15206, United States” (this matches 401 Shady Ave)
- To: “Giant Eagle, Pittsburgh, PA”

I pressed Enter in the “To” field but no route populated, likely because in this environment the route only calculates when the dedicated “press”/compute button is clicked (as per task tips). I see an unnamed button [520] with an image [521] in the directions panel that likely corresponds to the compute/press button.

Plan:
1) Click the compute/press button [520] to generate a route.
2) Next, switch the mode to “Foot” to obtain walkway directions if it doesn’t automatically recalculate.

Given only one action per step, clicking the compute/press button is the most productive next action to get initial routing results to appear.

The current route is set from “Kenmawr Apartments, 401, Shady Avenue…” (correct start) to “Giant Eagle, McKinney Lane, Parkway Center…” which is far (13km) and calculated in Car mode. The user asked for a “walkway,” so I need to switch the routing mode to walking first. The directions panel shows radio buttons for Car, Bicycle, and Foot, with Car currently selected. Selecting the Foot radio [179] should recalculate the route in walking mode. After that, I can refine the destination to a closer locally owned chain grocery (e.g., Giant Eagle Market District in Shadyside) if needed. The best immediate next step is to click the Foot radio button to switch to walking directions.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The OpenStreetMap directions view is relevant to the goal.
- The current setup does not meet the goal: it’s a driving route to a far Giant Eagle, not a walking route to the closest locally owned chain grocery.

  - [200] button “Reverse Directions” — visible, enabled.
  - Route details under [476] “Directions” and [492] steps are visible.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the radio labeled “Foot” [179] to switch to walking directions.
- Replace the destination with a nearby locally owned chain grocery: type “Giant Eagle Market District, Shadyside” into the “To” field [199] and press Enter to recalculate.

The user wants a walking route (“walkway”) from 401 Shady Ave to the closest locally owned chain grocery. In Pittsburgh, Giant Eagle qualifies as a locally owned chain. The current OpenStreetMap directions panel shows:
- From: “Kenmawr Apartments, 401, Shady Avenue, … 15206, United States” (correct origin).
- To: “Giant Eagle, McKinney Lane, Parkway Center, … 15220, United States” (a far location).
- Mode: Car (radio [173] checked).

To satisfy “walkway,” I must first switch the mode to walking. Previously, clicking the Foot radio [179] failed due to the Car label intercepting pointer events. The label element for Foot [180] is adjacent and usually toggles the radio when clicked. So, the best next step is to click the “Foot” label [180] to change the routing mode to walking. After that, I can refine the destination to the nearest Giant Eagle (e.g., Shadyside Market District) in subsequent steps.

The goal is to provide walking directions from 401 Shady Ave to the closest locally owned chain grocery. In Pittsburgh, Giant Eagle is a locally owned chain, and the nearest location to 401 Shady Ave is likely the Shadyside Market District on Centre Ave. The current directions show a walking route to a far Giant Eagle location at Parkway Center (14km), which is not the closest. The interface shows:

- To: “Giant Eagle, McKinney Lane, Parkway Center, … 15220” (incorrect destination).
- Mode: Foot is selected (good).
To correct this, I should replace the “To” field with “Giant Eagle Market District, Shadyside” to target the nearby store.

 <think>
The user wants walking directions (“walkway”) from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh to the nearest locally owned chain grocery. In Pittsburgh, Giant Eagle is a locally owned chain, and I’ve already set the “To” field to “Giant Eagle, Shadyside,” which should correspond to the nearby Shadyside location. The “From” field is correctly set to “Kenmawr Apartments, 401, Shady Avenue…” and the travel mode is Foot. However, the route summary and steps still reflect an old, faraway Giant Eagle destination (14km), indicating the route hasn’t been recalculated yet after updating the destination. In this UI, after entering addresses, the route is computed via the dedicated press/compute button (bid 520). Clicking this button should recalculate the route to “Giant Eagle, Shadyside” in walking mode and yield the closest walking route from 401 Shady Ave. Therefore, the best next action is to click the compute/press button to update the route.

The user’s goal is to find a walking route (“walkway”) from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh to the nearest chain grocery that is locally owned. In Pittsburgh, Giant Eagle is a locally owned, Pittsburgh-based chain grocery. On the current OpenStreetMap directions page, the “From” field is already set to “Kenmawr Apartments, 401, Shady Avenue, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA 15206, United States” (which corresponds to 401 Shady Ave), and the “To” field shows “Giant Eagle, 5550, Centre Avenue, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, United States.” The mode is “Foot,” and the route summary indicates Distance: 1.6km and Time: 0:21 with turn-by-turn steps listed (though many steps are unnamed). This matches the Shadyside Giant Eagle, which is indeed the nearest Giant Eagle to 401 Shady Ave. Therefore, I should present the route summary, including the full address with ZIP code and confirmation that this is a locally owned chain grocery, formatted concisely per instructions, including distance with no space before “km.”
