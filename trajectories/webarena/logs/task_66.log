The user wants URLs of posts in the "books" forum that recommend a single book, limited to the top 10 posts. First I need to navigate to the "books" forum. From the current homepage, the "Forums" link is visible in the header. Clicking "Forums" should take me to the forum list where I can find "books" (per tips, likely under an alphabetical listing). Once on the "books" forum page, I can look at the top 10 posts (sorted by Hot by default; if there are filter options like "Top" I may adjust later). Then I will identify which of those posts recommend a single book by inspecting the titles/links and collect the URLs from the post titles (since titles link to external URLs). The immediate next step is to click the "Forums" link to reach the forum list and locate "books".

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to the goal. The list shows the top posts with per-post title links and “comments” links.

  - [200] “125 comments” (post 2); state: visible, clickable.
  - [238] “33 comments” (post 3); state: visible, clickable.
These “comments” links lead to the internal post pages, which is where the post URLs can be collected. The visible top-10 list includes titles that explicitly reference a single book (e.g., “Just finished reading The Hobbit…”, “Apple Books has a free audiobook of A Christmas Carol…”), suggesting those are likely relevant; further items in the top 10 can be inspected similarly by using their “comments” links.

The user wants the URLs of posts within the top 10 items on the /f/books forum that recommend a single book. The page is already at /f/books sorted by “Hot.” I need to inspect the first 10 articles and identify which ones recommend a single book. From the visible titles, within the top 10 the candidates that clearly recommend or praise a single specific book are:
- “I just finished reading The Hobbit to my 6 year old daughter, and she loved it!” (8th item) — single book: The Hobbit.
- “Apple Books has a free audiobook of A Christmas Carol narrated by LeVar Burton!” (9th item) — single book: A Christmas Carol.

To provide the exact post URLs, I should open the internal post pages using their “comments” links (per the site tip: click “comments” link, not the title), then capture the URLs. I will first click the “138 comments” link for the The Hobbit post (element [426]). After navigation, I can read the tab’s URL in the environment and then go back to collect the A Christmas Carol post URL similarly.

The user wants URLs of posts among the top 10 in the "books" forum that recommend a single book. I’m currently on the internal page for one qualifying post: “I just finished reading The Hobbit to my 6 year old daughter, and she loved it!” The tab header shows its full URL: http://10.177.37.113:9999/f/books/17445/i-just-finished-reading-the-hobbit-to-my-6-year-old-daughter. To efficiently compile results, I should save this URL now, then return to the /f/books forum page via the breadcrumb to open other qualifying posts (e.g., the “Apple Books has a free audiobook of A Christmas Carol narrated by LeVar Burton!” post) and capture their URLs as well. Using take_note is appropriate to keep track of the first URL before navigating away.

To find any other qualifying posts within the top 10, I need to return to the /f/books forum listing to inspect the first ten posts and open their “comments” links (per the site tip) to get the internal post URLs. The breadcrumb link “/f/books” with bid 120 at the top of the current page will take me back to the forum list view.

🔍 Current State Analysis: You are back on the /f/books forum page, sorted by “Hot,” which is on the critical path for identifying the top 10 posts. To complete the goal, open the internal post pages (via their “comments” links) for any top-10 posts that clearly recommend a single book and record their URLs.
Relevant interactive elements (visible and enabled):
- Button “Sort by: Hot” [128] — confirms current listing order.
- Comments links under the top posts — use these to open the internal post pages:
  - “184 comments” [163] (first article: T. S. Eliot letters) — likely not a single-book recommendation.
  - “125 comments” [200] (second article: bookshop.org reminder) — not a single-book recommendation.
  - “33 comments” [238] (third article: notebook donations) — not a single-book recommendation.
  - “138 comments” (The Hobbit post) — already captured.
  - “87 comments” (post titled “Apple Books has a free audiobook of A Christmas Carol narrated by LeVar Burton!”) — appears to recommend a single book; click its “comments” link to capture the internal URL.

Goal: Provide URLs of posts among the top 10 in the "books" forum that recommend a single book. We are currently on the /f/books page sorted by Hot, displaying the list of articles. The top 10 posts are the first ten articles shown. From inspection, the posts within the top 10 that clearly recommend or focus on a single book are:
- “I just finished reading The Hobbit to my 6 year old daughter, and she loved it!” (single book: The Hobbit) — I already opened this via its “comments” link previously and saved its internal URL in a note.
- “Apple Books has a free audiobook of A Christmas Carol narrated by LeVar Burton!” (single book featured: A Christmas Carol) — need to open the internal post page via its “comments” link to capture its URL.

Per site tips, I must click the “comments” link to get the internal post URL. The “Apple Books…” post shows a “39 comments” link with bid 463. I will click that to navigate to the post page and then capture its URL in the next step before returning the final answer.
