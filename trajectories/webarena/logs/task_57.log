Goal: Identify the closest restaurant(s) to the University Center at Carnegie Mellon University using the current OpenStreetMap page.

Current page status: The map is centered on the Cohon University Center (University Center at CMU). I can see several food POIs labeled around/inside the building: "Au Bon Pain", "Nourish", "Grano", "Schatz Dining Room", "Entropy+". To determine which are closest, I should use the "Query features" tool, then click inside the University Center area to list all features at that location and confirm which restaurants are within the building (i.e., effectively the closest).

Planned steps:
1) Activate "Query features".
2) Click within the University Center building on top of the labeled restaurant icons to retrieve the list of features and confirm details (names, type).
3) Use the data to respond: the closest restaurants are those inside the University Center itself.

Objective: Identify the closest restaurant(s) to the University Center at Carnegie Mellon University using the current OpenStreetMap page.

Current state: The map is centered on “Cohon University Center” (the University Center at CMU). Visible food POIs within the building are labeled “Au Bon Pain,” “Nourish,” “Grano,” and “Schatz Dining Room.” “Entropy+” is also labeled but is a convenience store, not a restaurant. Since these restaurants are located inside the Cohon University Center itself, they are the closest possible options.

Given that the goal is to tell the user the closest restaurant(s), and we can clearly identify those inside the building from the current map view, the most appropriate next step is to provide the concise list to the user.

Plan: Send a message listing the restaurants inside the Cohon University Center as the closest.

Current state: The map is centered on “Cohon University Center” (the University Center at CMU). Visible food POIs within the building are labeled “Au Bon Pain,” “Nourish,” “Grano,” and “Schatz Dining Room.” “Entropy+” is also labeled but is a convenience store, not a restaurant. Since these restaurants are located inside the Cohon University Center itself, they are the closest possible options.

Given that the goal is to tell the user the closest restaurant(s), and we can clearly identify those inside the building from the current map view, the most appropriate next step is to provide the concise list to the user.

Plan: Send a message listing the restaurants inside the Cohon University Center as the closest.
