The user wants me to create a discussion post about "Harry Potter movie series" in a relevant subreddit (forum) and ask users for their opinions with the prompt "your opinion". On Postmill, I should first find an appropriate forum. The tips indicate that the "Forum" tab can help find a relevant subreddit and that I can find a name after clicking "alphabetical" in the Forum tab. Currently, I’m on the home page, and I see subscribed forums like books, sci_fi, etc., but there might be a more relevant one like "movies". Therefore, the next step is to click the "Forums" link to view the list of forums and ideally locate a "movies" or similar forum for posting. Once I find the right forum, I can use the "Submit" function to create the post, ensuring the Body contains all content and leaving the URL field empty per instructions. First action: navigate to Forums.

We are on the "Create submission" page for the forum "movies", which is the relevant subreddit-equivalent. The form shows a required Title field (bid 138), an optional Body field (bid 143), and a URL field (bid 128) because the "URL" radio is selected. Per the Task Tips, we must leave the URL field empty and put all content in the Body.
