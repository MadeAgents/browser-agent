The user needs the estimated driving time between two locations. On OpenStreetMap, the fastest way is to use the directions feature rather than manually searching each place. The accessibility tree shows a link labeled "Find directions between two points" with bid 167, which corresponds to the two-arrow button mentioned in the tips. Clicking this should open the directions input fields for start and end points so I can enter "DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown" as the start and "Keens Steakhouse" as the destination, then compute the route to get the driving time. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best action is to click that directions link to bring up the routing interface.

- Destination “To” textbox [199] is filled with “Keens Steakhouse”.
- Origin “From” textbox [194] is populated, but it resolved to “DoubleTree, 100, Nott Terrace, … Schenectady, New York” (incorrect origin for the stated goal).

  - Buttons “Close” [187], [217]: visible; avoid clicking.
- Off-track issue: The origin is set to a DoubleTree in Schenectady, not DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown, which would yield the wrong driving time.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Clear and retype the origin precisely: Type “DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown, New York, NY” into textbox “From” [194].
- After both fields are correct, press Enter while focused in “To” [199] to trigger route calculation and obtain the estimated driving time.

  - Textbox “From” [194]: filled with the correct hotel address (focused).
  - Textbox “To” [199]: filled with the correct Keens Steakhouse address.
  - Directions results area shows: “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” indicating a routing failure with the current service.
- This error suggests the selected router (OSRM) failed; trying another routing service is appropriate.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Change routing service: Open combobox “Directions services” [182] and select “Valhalla” [186] to recompute the route.
- If results don’t appear automatically, press Enter while focused in the “To” field [199] to trigger routing and display the estimated driving time.

The user's goal is to get the estimated driving time from DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown to Keens Steakhouse. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open, with Car mode selected. The "From" field contains "DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown, 8 Stone Street, New York, NY 10004," and the "To" field contains the full address for Keens Steakhouse. However, the results pane shows "Couldn't find a route between those two places," which suggests the current routing engine (OSRM) failed to compute a route even though both points are in Manhattan. A common fix on OSM is to switch the routing service to another available option (GraphHopper or Valhalla) to recompute the route. The combobox "Directions services" [182] is set to OSRM, and the options include Valhalla. Selecting "Valhalla" should retrigger route computation and likely produce the estimated driving time. Therefore, the next best single action is to change the routing engine to Valhalla using the select_option action on the combobox.

The “From” field currently contains “DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown, 8 Stone Street, New York, NY 10004,” and the “To” field contains Keens Steakhouse’s full address. However, the Directions area shows “Couldn't find a route between those two places,” likely because the origin is not snapping correctly to a routable point (the URL also still reflects an origin near Schenectady).

A reliable fix is to replace the origin with a concise street address that geocodes cleanly to a street location: “8 Stone St, New York, NY 10004.” After updating the “From” field, I can press Enter in a subsequent step to trigger routing. Since only one action is allowed now, I will update the “From” field with the simplified address.

✅ Current Progress:
- OpenStreetMap Directions panel is open and set to Car mode.
- “From” textbox [194] is filled with “8 Stone St, New York, NY 10004” (DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown).
- “To” textbox [199] is filled with Keens Steakhouse’s address.
- Routing service combobox [182] is set to “OSRM”.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page is on the critical path to obtain the driving time, but routing has failed.
- Relevant elements and states:
  - Radio “Car” [173]: checked (enabled).
  - Combobox “Directions services” [182]: value = “OSRM” (enabled, options: GraphHopper [184], OSRM [185]=selected, Valhalla [186]).
  - Textbox “From” [194]: filled, visible, focused.
  - Textbox “To” [199]: filled, visible.
  - Button “Reverse Directions” [200]: visible/enabled.
  - Directions panel [476]: shows error “Couldn't find a route between those two places.”
- The error indicates the route did not compute despite valid inputs; likely a geocoding/snap issue on the destination field.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Replace the destination with a concise street address to improve geocoding: fill('199', '72 W 36th St, New York, NY 10018').
- Retrigger routing: press('199', 'Enter').

The objective is to obtain the estimated driving time from DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown to Keens Steakhouse using the OpenStreetMap directions panel. The panel is already open with Car mode selected and the routing engine currently set to OSRM. The “From” field [194] is correctly set to “8 Stone St, New York, NY 10004” (the DoubleTree’s address). The “To” field [199] currently contains a very long, fully-qualified OSM place string for Keens Steakhouse. The Directions pane shows “Couldn't find a route between those two places,” which suggests that the current geocoded destination may not be snapping correctly to the road network or that the UI needs a cleaner address to resolve properly.

A common fix is to replace an overly verbose destination string with a concise, standard street address. For Keens Steakhouse, the standard address is “72 W 36th St, New York, NY 10018.” Updating the “To” field with this simplified address should allow the routing engine to resolve the endpoint cleanly. After that, I can trigger the route computation (e.g., by pressing Enter) in the following step. Because only one action is allowed now, I will first fill the “To” field with the simplified address.
