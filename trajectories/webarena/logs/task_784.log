The user wants the email address of the contributor with the most commits to branch main. On GitLab, this information is typically found under the Repository section’s "Contributors" tab, which can be filtered by branch. The current page is the project overview and shows files for the "development" branch. To access contributor statistics, I should navigate to the "Repository" section from the left sidebar. From there, I expect to find the "Contributors" tab and then select the branch filter to "main" (or "master" if "main" is not available, per the provided tip). The next best step is to click the "Repository" link in the project navigation.

- Link “Contributors” [315] in the Repository sidebar.
- Link “Commits” [306] and “Branches” [309] in the Repository sidebar.
- Branch selector button labeled “development” [528], hasPopup='menu', expanded=False, indicating the current branch is “development” (not “main”); it is visible and clickable.
This page provides access to the needed “Contributors” view and branch selection to proceed toward identifying the top committer for the “main” branch.

The goal is to find the email address of the contributor with the most commits to the main branch. On GitLab, the "Contributors" tab under the Repository section provides a summary of contributors and commit counts, often with branch filters. The current page shows the Files view for the "development" branch. To identify the top contributor by commits, I should navigate to the "Contributors" tab from the repository sidebar, where I can check for branch filters (main or master per the tip) and then determine the top contributor. Once identified, I may need to click into their details or a commit authored by them to find their email if it's not displayed directly in the contributors list. The immediate next step is to click the "Contributors" link.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the project’s Contributors view. Currently viewing “Commits to development” (not main).

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal, but the branch is set to “development,” not “main.” Relevant elements:
- Branch selector button labeled “development” [498], hasPopup='menu', expanded=False — visible and enabled; use this to switch to the “main” branch.
- Heading “Commits to development” [518] confirms the current branch context.
- “Contributors” navigation link [308] is present in the Repository section, but the current view already displays contributors.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the branch selector button labeled “development” [498] and choose “main” from the menu to view contributors for the main branch.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the Contributors page and switched the branch filter from “development” to “master.” The page now shows “Commits to master.”

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is directly relevant to the goal. It displays contributor activity and commit counts for the selected branch.
- Heading “Commits to master” [518] — confirms the branch context.
- Branch selector button labeled “master” [498], enabled/visible — can be used to switch to “main” if it exists separately.
- “History” link [515], enabled — ancillary, not needed for identifying top contributor.
- Commit activity chart [524], visible — contextual data.
Note: If the repository’s default branch is “master” (no separate “main”), this view represents the main branch. If “main” exists, use the branch selector [498] to switch to it. The contributor cards with commit counts are visible on the page (as per the screenshot), and scanning them will identify the top contributor and their email, but specific card identifiers are not listed in the provided AX tree excerpt.
