The user wants to post a submission in r/books (forum f/books) with the body comment "It's a book with history". To do this, I should navigate to the forum directory to find the books forum. The current page shows a top navigation link labeled "Forums" (bid 42). According to the task tips, I should go to the Forum tab and then use alphabetical to find the specific forum. The first step is to click "Forums" to reach the forums listing. This is the most logical next step; I shouldn't use search yet or click Submit before selecting the correct forum, as the workflow requires navigating to the relevant subreddit/forum first.
