The user wants to create a new group named "n-lab" and add specific members. On the current GitLab dashboard, the most direct way to start creating a group is via the "Create new..." link in the top navigation bar. The accessibility tree shows a link labeled "Create new..." with bid 141 near the top right. Clicking this should open a dropdown where "New group" is typically an option. My plan is to click "Create new..." first, then in subsequent steps select "New group," fill in the group details, create it, and then navigate to the group's Members area to invite patou, egpast, westurner, and jontutcher. For now, the best next single action is to click the "Create new..." link.

The goal is to add members to the newly created “n-lab” group. I’m on the group’s Activity page, which doesn’t provide member management. The sidebar under Group navigation shows a link labeled “Group information” with bid 264. In my previous step, I mistakenly attempted to click bid 267, which timed out. To reach the area where I can access the Members tab and the “Invite members” button, I should click the correct “Group information” link (bid 264). This is the most direct path to invite patou, egpast, westurner, and jontutcher.

✅ Current Progress:
- New group “n-lab” has been created.
- Currently viewing the group’s “Activity” page.
- No members (patou, egpast, westurner, jontutcher) have been added yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is within the “n-lab” group context but is not the member management interface needed to invite users.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Sidebar link “Group information” (id: 264) — visible and clickable; expected path to member management.
  - Top tab “Team” (id: 429) — visible and clickable; related to team view.
  - Sidebar link “Settings” (id: 344) — visible and clickable; not needed for inviting members.
  - Global link “Create new...” (id: 144) — visible and clickable; unrelated to adding members.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- The previous click on “Group information” did not navigate. Retry: Click link id='264' labeled “Group information” to reach the area where member management is available.

The user’s goal is to create the group “n-lab” and add members. The group is already created, and I’m currently on its Activity page. I need to reach the area where I can manage members. The sidebar includes a “Group information” link (bid 264), which I tried to click in the last step, but the page did not navigate. To avoid repeating an action that didn’t produce a response, I’ll use an alternative navigation path: the breadcrumb “n-lab” (bid 394).

The task is to invite four members to the newly created "n-lab" group. The "Invite members" modal is open. I have already added "patou" as a token. The input field currently has "egpast" typed in, and an autocomplete dropdown shows a selectable suggestion "egpast egpast" (menuitem bid 942). To correctly add egpast, I should click this suggestion so it becomes a token in the field, similar to how patou was added. After that, I will proceed to add "westurner" and "jontutcher" in subsequent steps and finally click Invite. For now, selecting the "egpast" suggestion is the optimal next action.

The user’s goal is to create a new group “n-lab” and add members patou, egpast, westurner, and jontutcher. The group has already been created, and the “Invite members” modal is open. In the “Username or email address” field, all four users have been added as selection tokens, confirming they’re ready to be invited. The default role is “Guest,” which the user did not request to change. The next step to complete the invitations is to click the “Invite” button in the modal. This should submit the invitations and finalize adding these members to the group.
