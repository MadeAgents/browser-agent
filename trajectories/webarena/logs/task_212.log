The user needs the customer name and email associated with a specific phone number. In Magento Admin, customer contact details are typically found in the Customers section (All Customers grid or individual customer profiles), and sometimes in Orders with address telephone fields. The best first step from the Dashboard is to navigate to the CUSTOMERS area to access the customer list and use filters/search to find the given phone number. The left sidebar shows a "CUSTOMERS" menu item with bid 207. Clicking it should open the customers management page where I can proceed to search/filter by phone number.

The user wants the customer name and email for a specific phone number. In Magento Admin, the likely place to search for a phone number is under CUSTOMERS > All Customers, where a grid with filter options appears. From the Dashboard, the CUSTOMERS menu is already expanded and shows "All Customers" (bid 214). The next best step is to click "All Customers" to open the customer list and then use filters to search for the phone number 555-229-3326. I will click the All Customers link.

The user wants the customer name and email for phone number 555-229-3326. I am already on the Customers grid in Magento Admin, which shows columns for Name, Email, and Phone. Scanning the visible rows, I see an entry with the phone formatted as "(555) 229-3326" in the row for "Veronica Costello" with email "roni_cost@example.com". Since this directly matches the target phone number, I can provide the requested name and email without further navigation or filtering. I will send the answer to the user.
