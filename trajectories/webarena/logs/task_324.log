The user wants to see chairs listings sorted by ascending price. The site has a top navigation with categories that have submenus accessible via hover. Chairs are likely under "Home & Kitchen" → Furniture → Chairs, or possibly in another relevant category. The best first step is to hover over "Home & Kitchen" (menuitem [708]) to reveal its submenu, then I can look for "Chairs" and proceed to sort by price ascending once on the chairs category page.

✅ Current Progress: Hovered “Home & Kitchen” to open its submenu. Navigation toward the Chairs category has begun, but the Chairs listing page is not yet reached and sorting has not been applied.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the site’s homepage and remains on the critical path toward the goal. The “Home & Kitchen” menu is expanded, showing subcategories.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - menuitem “Furniture” (id: 713), hasPopup=menu, visible/enabled — likely contains “Chairs” in its submenu.
  - Other visible subcategories under “Home & Kitchen”: “Bedding” (745), “Storage & Organization” (759), “Home Décor Products” (776), “Kitchen & Dining” (802), “Heating, Cooling & Air Quality” (816), “Wall Art” (819), “Bath” (827).
- No “Chairs” link is visible yet; it will likely appear after expanding “Furniture.” The search combobox (386) exists but the Search button (391) is disabled, making category navigation the appropriate path.

The goal is to show the "chairs" listings sorted by ascending price. I already hovered over "Home & Kitchen" which revealed a vertical submenu containing "Furniture" with hasPopup=menu, indicating another nested submenu where "Chairs" is likely located. The next logical step is to hover on "Furniture" (bid 713) to reveal its subcategories, which should include "Chairs." Once "Chairs" appears, I can click it and then apply sorting by price ascending on that category page. For now, I will hover "Furniture" to expose the "Chairs" link.

- Other controls:

- Conclusion: Still on-track; need to navigate into the appropriate Furniture subcategory (e.g., Living Room, Dining Room, or Home Office) to locate “Chairs,” then use that category page’s sorting control to set ascending price.

The user asked to show "chairs" listings sorted by ascending price. I’m on the homepage with the top navigation expanded: I already hovered “Home & Kitchen” and then “Furniture,” which revealed a submenu with subcategories like Living Room Furniture, Accent Furniture, Home Office Furniture, Kitchen Furniture, etc. There is no direct “Chairs” link visible at this level, so it’s likely nested under one of these subcategories. The most typical place for chairs is under “Living Room Furniture,” which might open another submenu containing “Chairs.” Following the browsing tip to use dropdown menus, the next step is to hover over “Living Room Furniture” (bid 718) to reveal deeper options, ideally “Chairs,” so I can click it and then sort by price ascending on that category page.

The user's goal is to view "chairs" listings sorted by ascending price. From the current homepage, I explored the top navigation via hovers (Home & Kitchen → Furniture and then subitems). However, no direct “Chairs” link is visible in the current submenu, and clicking through nested categories may be slower and risk landing on subcategories like "Accent" or "Dining" without a universal chairs listing.

Given the general tips that using the search bar is often faster to find specific items and that the search field is readily available at the top (combobox id 386), the efficient next step is to search for "chairs." This should take us to a results page where sorting controls are typically available, allowing me to set sorting by price ascending. I will first fill the search box with "chairs," then in subsequent steps, I can execute the search and apply the sort.

✅ Current Progress:
- Executed the search for “chairs” and arrived at the search results page.
- Results are displayed (Items 1–12 of 3418). Sorting has not been changed yet (still by Relevance).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to the goal (show chairs listings by ascending price).
- Relevant interactive elements for sorting:
  - Combobox “Sort By” (id: 1378) — visible, enabled, current value: “Relevance”; options include “Product Name” (id: 1379), “Price” (id: 1380), and “Relevance” (id: 1381, selected=True).
  - Link “Set Ascending Direction” (id: 1382) — visible, enabled; indicates current sort direction is not ascending.
- Product listings are visible with prices; changing “Sort By” to “Price” and setting ascending direction should satisfy the goal.

The user wants the search results for “chairs” sorted by ascending price. I’m already on the results page for “chairs” (Items 1–12 of 3418). I see the sorting controls:
- “Sort By” combobox (bid 1378) currently set to “Relevance” with options including “Price”.
- A link labeled “Set Ascending Direction” (bid 1382), indicating the current sort direction is not ascending.

To satisfy the goal, first I need to change “Sort By” to “Price,” and then set the direction to ascending. Since only one action is allowed per step, the best next action is to select “Price” in the “Sort By” combobox. After that, I will click “Set Ascending Direction” to ensure the ordering is ascending.

The user wants the “chairs” listings sorted by ascending price. I’m already on the search results page for “chairs,” and the Sort By combobox shows “Price.” The products currently displayed start with very high prices, indicating the current direction is likely descending. There is a control labeled “Set Ascending Direction,” which should toggle the sort order to ascending. To fulfill the request, I should click this link to change the sorting to ascending price. Only a single action is allowed now, so I will click the “Set Ascending Direction” control.
