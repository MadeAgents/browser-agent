The user's goal is to submit a merge request for the a11yproject.com repository, merging the redesign branch into the master branch, and assign Justin Armstrong as the reviewer. I’m currently on the GitLab dashboard listing projects. I see “The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com” in the projects list with the link element [361]. The next logical step is to open this project to access its repository and create a merge request. From there, I’ll look for the "Merge requests" tab or the "Create merge request" flow, select source branch "redesign" and target "master," then assign the reviewer.

The goal is to create and submit a merge request from the redesign branch into the master branch and assign Justin Armstrong as the reviewer. I’m on the “New merge request” page where the Source branch is already set to “redesign.” The Target branch currently shows “main.” Since the user requested “master,” I should try changing the target branch to “master” before continuing. The most direct way is to click the “main” button in the Target branch section to open the branch selector and look for “master.” After setting the target, I can proceed to the MR form to assign the reviewer and submit. So the next best action is to click the “main” target branch button.

- ensure the target branch is master (or confirm “main” if master doesn’t exist),
- assign Justin Armstrong as reviewer,
- and convert the MR from draft to “ready” (submit), typically by clicking "Mark as ready" or removing "Draft:" from the title.

The next best single action is to click the "Draft: Redesign" link for MR !1533 to open it.

✅ Current Progress:
- Located and opened the existing merge request “Draft: Redesign” (!1533) in The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com.
- Verified source branch is “redesign”.
- Merge request is open but still in draft; no reviewer assigned.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to the goal; it is the MR details view where branch targets and reviewers can be set.
- Key elements:
  - Link “Edit” [624] — visible and enabled; used to modify MR details (including target branch and reviewers).
  - Source branch link “redesign” [677] — visible; confirms correct source.
  - Target branch link “main” [680] — visible; currently set to “main”, which does not match the requested “master”.
  - Right sidebar shows “0 Assignees” and “0 Reviewers” — visible; current state is unassigned.
  - MR status indicator “Open” and title prefix “Draft: Redesign” — visible; MR is not marked ready.
- The page is relevant; to meet the goal, the target branch may need changing to “master” (if available) and Justin Armstrong must be set as reviewer via the edit form. After adjustments, the MR should be finalized/submitted (i.e., out of draft if required).

The goal is to have the existing merge request (!1533) for a11yproject.com merging the redesign branch into the master branch and assign Justin Armstrong as the reviewer. I’m on the MR detail page where the header shows “Byte Blaze requested to merge redesign into main,” and the right sidebar shows “0 Reviewers.” To change the target branch (from main to master, if available) and assign a reviewer, the most efficient path is to open the MR edit form using the main “Edit” link near the title.

The target branch is currently set to “main.” I opened the branch selector and typed “master” into the search box (value now shows master), but no selectable “master” option is visible in the accessibility tree. Given the provided tip that “main often means master,” it’s likely there is no separate “master” branch here; the default branch is “main.” To proceed efficiently, I should close the branch selector, then remove the “Draft” prefix (to allow submission), and save changes.

Since only a single action is allowed per step, the next best move is to close the branch selector so I can proceed to remove the draft prefix and save the MR.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened existing merge request !1533 and navigated to its Edit page.
- Reviewer set to Justin Armstrong.
- Source branch confirmed as “redesign”.
- Attempted to switch target branch to “master” via branch picker search; target currently remains “main”.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This Edit MR page is on the critical path to submitting the merge request.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Target branch button “main” [607] — visible/enabled; branch picker was opened and search field “Search branches” [616] currently has value “master”; no new target selected, so “main” remains active.
  - Title field “Title (required)” [626] — value is “Draft: Redesign”; helper link “Remove the Draft prefix” [629] is visible to allow the MR to be mergeable.
  - Reviewer — shows “Justin Armstrong” (assigned).
  - “Save changes” button [895] — visible and enabled.
- Page is correctly positioned to finalize the MR. Remaining actions: set target to “master” if available, remove the “Draft” prefix, and save changes to submit the MR.

The task is to submit the existing merge request (!1533) for a11yproject.com, ensuring it merges the redesign branch into master and has Justin Armstrong as the reviewer. On the Edit MR page, I see:
- Source: redesign
- Target: main (no master option found; per tips, main often equals master)
- Reviewer: Justin Armstrong is already assigned (button shows his name)
- Title: "Draft: Redesign" with a link "Remove the Draft prefix," which is necessary to allow merging.

To make the MR mergeable, I need to remove the "Draft" prefix, then save changes. Since only one action is allowed per step, I will first click the "Remove the Draft prefix" link to change the title to "Redesign." After that, I will save changes in the next step.

- Reviewer set to Justin Armstrong.
- Title updated by removing the “Draft” prefix; current title is “Redesign”.
- Source branch confirmed as “redesign”.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This Edit MR page is on the critical path to achieving the goal.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Target branch button “main” [607] — visible/enabled, currently selected; branch search field “Search branches” [616] was set to “master” but no selectable “master” entry appeared.
  - Title textbox “Title (required)” [626] — value is “Redesign”, required field satisfied.
  - Reviewer control — shows “Justin Armstrong” (assigned) [759], visible.
  - “Save changes” button [895] — visible and enabled.
- The page is correctly positioned to finalize the MR. Remaining actions are to save changes (to persist the reviewer and title) and, if a “master” target exists, switch via [607]; otherwise proceed with “main” as the target.

The goal is to finalize and submit the existing merge request (!1533) so it merges the redesign branch into the master branch and assigns Justin Armstrong as the reviewer. I’m on the Edit MR page where:
- Source branch is redesign.
- Target branch is main; searching for master did not show any master option, aligning with the tip that “main often means master,” so main is the default target here.
- Reviewer is already set to “Justin Armstrong.”
- Title has been updated to “Redesign” (draft prefix removed), which allows the MR to be ready for merging.

To persist these changes and effectively submit the MR, I should click the “Save changes” button. This will save the reviewer assignment and the removal of the Draft prefix. After saving, the MR will be non-draft and ready for review/merge.

✅ Current Progress:
- Located and opened existing merge request !1533 for “Redesign”.
- Removed “Draft” status; MR is now Open and marked ready.
- Assigned Justin Armstrong as reviewer; activity confirms “requested review from Justin Armstrong”.
- Saved changes on the MR.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Current page is the MR detail for “Redesign (!1533)”—this is on the critical path to the goal.
- Branches: Header shows “requested to merge redesign into main”; target branch link “main” [680] is visible. During edit, searching for “master” in the branch selector did not reveal a “master” option.
- Reviewer: Right sidebar shows “Reviewer Justin Armstrong” (assigned).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - “Edit” link [624] — visible/enabled; allows modifying target branch and MR metadata.
  - Target branch link “main” [680] — visible; indicates current target.
  - Comment composer and “Close merge request” button — visible; not required for the goal.
- Status: MR is submitted (Open) with the correct source branch (redesign) and reviewer assigned. The only potential mismatch is the target branch label (“main” vs requested “master”).

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- If “master” is required and exists: Click “Edit” [624], open the target branch selector, use the “Search branches” field to select “master,” then click “Save changes.”
- If “master” is not available in this repository, proceed with “main” as the default target; the MR is already submitted and assigned to Justin Armstrong.
