The goal is to post the user's question in a Pittsburgh-focused forum. I’m on the “Create submission” page for the pittsburgh forum, with the forum combobox correctly set to “pittsburgh.” The Title field has already been filled with the exact question text. According to the Task Tips, I should put all content in the Body and leave the URL field empty. The current submission type shows the URL radio selected with an empty URL textbox, which aligns with the guidance to leave it empty. The next best step is to fill the Body textbox with the question text, then I will submit the post in the following step.

The user’s goal was to find a Pittsburgh-focused forum and post the question “places for new drivers to learn driving.” Based on the current page, I’m on the post detail view within the Pittsburgh forum (/f/pittsburgh), showing the article with the exact title, the forum labeled “pittsburgh,” and “No comments,” confirming the post was created successfully. The sidebar shows a “Short URL: http://10.177.37.113:9999/3,” and the browser tab URL is the full post URL. Since the task is complete, the appropriate next action is to inform the user with confirmation and the post link(s). I will use send_msg_to_user to provide a concise confirmation including the forum name and both the full and short URLs.
