The user wants to reduce the price of the green Hollister backyard sweater in all sizes by $5. In Magento, this is likely a configurable product with color and size attributes, so we need to adjust the prices of all simple products (variants) where color = Green associated with the "Hollister backyard sweater."

From the Dashboard, the most direct path is to go to Catalog > Products, then search for the product by name. The navigation bar contains a "CATALOG" link (bid 189). Clicking it should navigate to the Catalog section, typically defaulting to the Products grid. From there, I can use the search or filters to find "Hollister backyard sweater," edit the configurable product, and then either:
- Use "Edit Configurations" to bulk adjust prices for the green variants, or
- Open each green variant and reduce its price by $5.

First step: click CATALOG to get to Products.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page (Products grid) is on the critical path to adjust product prices.
- Active filters: “Keyword: Hollister” (list item 2797) with a remove button (2800); “Clear all” (914) is visible/enabled.
- Key interactive elements to progress:
  - Filters panel toggle button (902 “Filters”) — visible/enabled; use to refine by attributes such as Color or Name.
  - Search by keyword textbox (1397) — value set to “Hollister”, editable; Search button (1398) — enabled.
  - Actions dropdown (1403 “Actions”) — enabled; used for bulk operations after selecting rows.
  - Grid selection: header checkbox (1748) to select all currently visible rows; individual row checkboxes available in the first “Options” column.
  - Price column present (1773 “Price”) to verify current values before/after edits.
- The grid content aligns with the goal context (Hollister products present; Green variants visible), so continuing here is appropriate. To reduce the price of the green variants of the target product across all sizes, you will need to isolate the specific “Backyard …” product’s Green variants (e.g., via Filters by Color = Green and/or Name) and then edit prices (individually via each product page or via bulk action where supported).

The task is to reduce the price of the green Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt across all sizes by $5. We’re on the Products grid filtered by the keyword “Hollister” and can see the configurable product and all associated variants, including the green variants across sizes XS, S, M, L, and XL. The most efficient approach is to select only the green variants and use the Actions dropdown to perform a bulk “Update Attributes” to adjust the Price for the selected items.

To begin, I will select the checkboxes for the green variants. The first green variant in the list is “Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt-S-Green” (ID 114). The checkbox for that row is present in the first gridcell of that row, with bid 2848. I will click this checkbox to start selecting the green variants. Subsequent steps will select the remaining green variants: XS-Green (2971), M-Green (3381), L-Green (3258), XL-Green (3094).

Task: Reduce the price of the green Hollister backyard sweater in all sizes by $5.

Current page: Magento Admin > Catalog > Products with keyword filter "Hollister". The grid shows the configurable product and all associated variants. We need to select all "Green" variants (XS, S, M, L, XL) and then use Actions > Update Attributes to adjust the prices. 

Selection status:
- "Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt-S-Green" (ID 114) is already selected (checkbox 2848 checked).
- "Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt-XS-Green" (ID 111) is already selected (checkbox 2971 checked).

  - M-Green (ID 117): checkbox 3381 (currently unchecked).
  - L-Green (ID 120): checkbox 3258 (currently unchecked).
  - XL-Green (ID 123): checkbox 3094 (currently unchecked).

Plan:
- Next, select one of the remaining unchecked green variants. I will select M-Green first by clicking checkbox 3381. Subsequent steps will select L-Green (3258) and XL-Green (3094), then proceed to Actions > Update Attributes to reduce the price by $5.

This is aligned with the site tips: using the Products grid and Actions for bulk updates. Only one action per step is allowed, so I'll proceed with selecting the M-Green checkbox.

The goal is to reduce the price of the green Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt across all sizes by $5. I’m on the Products grid filtered by “Hollister.” The grid shows all variants including the green ones. I have already selected four green variants: XS-Green (checkbox 2971), S-Green (2848), M-Green (3381), and L-Green (3258). The remaining green variant to include is XL-Green (ID 123), whose selection checkbox is bid 3094 and is currently unchecked. To proceed with a bulk update via Actions > Update Attributes, I need to first select XL-Green. After this selection, I will use the Actions dropdown to update the price for all selected items to $47.00 (reducing by $5 from $52.00).

We need to reduce the price of all green variants of the "Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt" by $5. We’ve already filtered the Products grid by “Hollister” and selected all five green variants (XS, S, M, L, XL). The grid indicates “(5 selected)”, confirming correct selection. The efficient approach is to use the bulk "Update attributes" action. The Actions dropdown is open (id 1403), and the list shows “Update attributes” (id 1416). Clicking this will take us to the mass attribute update form where we can set the Price. Since each green variant shows $52.00 in the grid, we will later set Price to 47.00 (a $5 reduction) via the "Change" checkbox for the Price field, then save. The immediate next step is to click “Update attributes”.

The user’s goal is to reduce the price of the green Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt across all sizes by $5.
