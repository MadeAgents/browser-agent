The user needs the total payment amount of the last 5 completed orders. In Magento Admin, that information is found under Sales > Orders where we can filter by status (Complete) and sort by Purchase Date descending to identify the most recent 5 completed orders.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened the “SALES” menu from the Magento Admin Dashboard (Sales menu expanded). No orders list accessed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is the Magento Admin Dashboard with the Sales menu open, which is on the critical path toward viewing orders and filtering for completed ones.
- Relevant interactive elements to proceed:
  - Link “Orders” (id: 168), visible/enabled under Sales menu.
  - Other Sales submenu links (Invoices [171], Shipments [174], etc.) are present but not needed for this goal.
- Not yet on the Orders grid where filtering and sorting can be applied to find the last 5 completed orders. The dashboard content (e.g., “Reload Data” button [714]) is not relevant to the goal.

Goal: Compute the total payment amount of the last 5 completed orders. To achieve this, I need to navigate to the Orders grid where I can filter by status "Complete," sort by Purchase Date in descending order (as required by the benchmark), then gather the Grand Total for the latest 5 completed orders and sum them using the calculate() function.

Current page: Magento Admin Dashboard with the Sales menu expanded. The "Orders" link is visible (bid 168). The immediate next step is to open the Orders page. Once on the Orders grid, I will apply a filter for Completed status, sort by Purchase Date descending, and then retrieve totals for the top 5 entries.

Thus, my next best action is to click the "Orders" link in the Sales menu to navigate to the Orders listing.

  - Table [1368] with column headers “↓ Purchase Date” [1390] and “Grand Total (Purchased)” [1398] — these are essential for identifying the latest 5 completed orders and their payment amounts.
  - Data rows begin at rowgroup [1408] with first row [1409]; values for each row are in gridcells under the “Grand Total (Purchased)” column.
  - Pagination shows “records found” 153, “per page” set to 200 [1099], and pagination controls disabled ([1128], [1131]) with “of 1” [1129], meaning all results are on a single page.
- To proceed, read the “Grand Total (Purchased)” values from the first five rows (top of the table, given descending purchase date) and sum them.

The goal is to get the total payment amount of the last 5 completed orders. I’m already on Sales > Orders with the filter Status: Complete applied. Per the benchmark rule, I ensured the grid is sorted by Purchase Date in descending order by clicking the Purchase Date column header. 

From the table (which displays all 153 records on one page with per page set to 200), the most recent five rows by date at the end of the list are:
- 000000230 — May 19, 2023 8:11:51 AM — Grand Total (Purchased) $93.40
