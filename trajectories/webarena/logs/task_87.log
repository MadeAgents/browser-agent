The user asks for the estimated driving time from “red roof inn” to “Pittsburgh science museum.” Based on the task tips for this benchmark, I should use the OpenStreetMap site and specifically the directions feature. The current page shows the standard OSM interface with a search box and a link labeled “Find directions between two points” (with two arrows) next to the Go button. The first step is to enter the directions tool. After that, I’ll input the start as “Red Roof Inn” (choosing the one in Pittsburgh, PA if multiple appear, per the tips) and the destination as “Pittsburgh science museum” (which likely corresponds to Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh), ensure the driving mode is selected, and then run the route to see the estimated driving time. The immediate next action is to click the “Find directions between two points” link to open the directions pane.

The user needs the estimated driving time from “Red Roof Inn” to “Pittsburgh science museum.” I’m on the OpenStreetMap directions interface, with the directions panel visible. The driving mode (Car) is already selected, and there are two text inputs labeled “From” [194] and “To” [199]. 

Following the benchmark tips, I should use the directions feature and input the origin and destination, preferring the one located in Pittsburgh, PA if the name is ambiguous. Multiple Red Roof Inn locations exist around Pittsburgh, so I’ll specify “Red Roof Inn, Pittsburgh, PA” in the From field to bias the result to the Pittsburgh one. After filling both fields, I can press Enter in the “To” field to compute the route and retrieve the estimated driving time. 

The next immediate step is to populate the “From” field.

The user wants the estimated driving time from Red Roof Inn to "Pittsburgh science museum." The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with mode set to Car. The "From" field [194] contains a specific Red Roof Inn address in Pittsburgh (6404 Steubenville Pike, PA 15277), which satisfies the requirement to use the Pittsburgh location. The "To" field [199] is filled with "Pittsburgh science museum" and is currently focused. To compute the route and see the estimated driving time, I should trigger the route calculation. On OSM, this is typically done by pressing Enter in the destination field. There is no explicit "Go" button visible in the accessibility tree apart from "Reverse Directions," so pressing Enter on the focused "To" field is the right next step to generate the route results (time/distance).
