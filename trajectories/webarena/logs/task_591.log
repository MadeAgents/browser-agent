The user wants a milestone created in the current GitLab project (Primer / design). On GitLab, milestones are typically under the Issues section (Issues > Milestones). The left sidebar shows an "Issues" link (bid 330). The plan:
1) Click "Issues" in the project sidebar to navigate to the Issues area where the Milestones tab should be available.
2) Once on the Issues page, locate and click the "Milestones" tab.
3) Click "New milestone" or similar button.
4) Fill in the title (e.g., "Collective code review practice") and set Start date: 2023-01-16 and Due date: 2023-02-05 (20 days after start).
5) Create/save the milestone.

First step: click the Issues link in the project navigation.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward creating a milestone, but currently shows the Issues list rather than the Milestones view. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link 'Milestones' (id: [348]) in the left sidebar under Issues → visible and enabled; needed to access milestone creation.
- Link 'Issues' (id: [339]) and 'Boards' (id: [342]) under Issues → visible and enabled; not needed for milestone creation.
- Link 'New issue' (id: [593]) in main content → visible and enabled; not relevant to creating a milestone.
- Textbox 'Search or filter results' (id: [617]) → visible and empty; not required for milestone creation.

The user wants a milestone created with a specific start date (1/16/2023) and an end date 20 days later (which will be 2/5/2023). In GitLab, milestones are under the Issues section. On the current "Issues" page for the project "Primer / design", the left sidebar shows a nested link "Milestones" under Issues (bid 348). To proceed with creating a milestone, I need to navigate to the Milestones page first, where I expect to find a "New milestone" button to create it and then fill in the title and dates. Therefore, the next step is to click the "Milestones" link in the sidebar.

The user's goal is to create a milestone for “collective code review” starting on 1/16/2023 and ending 20 days later. I am currently on the Milestones page for the project Primer / design. Scanning the list, I see an existing milestone entry:
- Title: “Collective code review practice” (bid 624)
- Dates: “Jan 16, 2023–Feb 5, 2023”
- Status: “Expired”
This exactly matches the requested start date and a 20-day duration (Jan 16 to Feb 5). Since the milestone already exists, creating another would be a duplicate. The best next step is to inform the user that the milestone already exists and confirm if they want any changes or a new, differently named milestone instead.
