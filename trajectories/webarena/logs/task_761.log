The user asked for directions from Carnegie Science Museum to Hunt library CMU using walk options. On the OpenStreetMap homepage, there is a link labeled "Find directions between two points" with bid 167. The first step is to open the directions panel where I can enter the start and end points and then choose the walking option. According to the task tips, this is the correct flow for routes, and using the directions feature is preferred over generic search. I will click the link to open the directions UI.

The user needs walking directions from Carnegie Science Museum to Hunt Library at CMU. We are on the OpenStreetMap directions interface with the modes displayed as Car (checked), Bicycle, and Foot. My previous attempt to click the Foot radio [179] failed because the Car label [174] intercepted pointer events. To avoid the click being blocked by overlapping label elements, I should use the keyboard-based press action on the Foot radio, which focuses the element and sends a keypress. Pressing Space on a radio button typically selects it. Once walking mode is set, I’ll proceed to fill the From and To fields and then initiate routing, but since only one action is allowed per step, the next best action is to switch to Foot via keyboard.

The user wants walking directions from Carnegie Science Museum to Hunt Library at CMU. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with the transport mode set to Foot (walking), and the origin field (From [194]) is correctly set to the Carnegie Science Center address in Pittsburgh. The destination field (To [199]) currently contains “Hunt library CMU,” which previously led to a “Search failed” modal that I closed. To resolve the destination properly, I should refine the query to a more precise and recognizable name for OpenStreetMap, such as “Hunt Library, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA.” After updating the destination, I can press Enter in a subsequent step if needed to trigger routing. The best immediate action is to update the To field with the refined, location-specific query.

The goal is to get walking directions from Carnegie Science Museum to Hunt Library at CMU using the OpenStreetMap directions interface. The directions panel is open with the transport mode set to Foot (radio [179] checked), which satisfies the "walk options" requirement. The From field [194] is already populated with the Carnegie Science Center address in Pittsburgh, PA, which aligns with the intended origin. The To field [199] has been updated to the more precise “Hunt Library, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA,” and it is currently focused. To initiate route computation on OSM, pressing Enter in the To field typically triggers the routing. Previously, pressing Enter resulted in a "Search failed" due to an ambiguous query, but now the refined destination should be locatable. Therefore, the next best step is to press Enter on the To textbox to compute the walking route.

Goal: Get walking directions from Carnegie Science Museum to Hunt Library at CMU using the OpenStreetMap directions panel.

Current state analysis:
- The directions panel is open with transport mode set to Foot (radio [179] checked), satisfying the walking requirement.
- From textbox [194] is correctly set to “Carnegie Science Center, 1, Allegheny Avenue, …, 15212, United States” (which corresponds to Carnegie Science Museum).
- To textbox [199] currently has “Hunt Library, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA.”
- Previous attempts to route with this destination resulted in “Search failed,” indicating Nominatim couldn’t resolve that exact phrasing.
- No modal is currently blocking; panel is interactable.

Plan:
- Refine the destination to a more precise address that Nominatim is likely to recognize, such as “Hunt Library, Frew Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.”
- After updating the To field, in the next step I will press Enter to trigger route calculation.

Rationale for next action:
- Since the earlier query failed, improving specificity (street name + ZIP) should help geocoding resolve the destination. Performing the fill action on [199] aligns with the one-action constraint and sets us up to trigger routing next.
