The user asks which customer has placed 2 orders in the entire history. To determine this, I should use the Magento Admin’s reporting features. Based on the Task Tips, the correct path is through the REPORTS tab, then find the Customers > Orders Count report, and set the date range from Jan 1, 2022 to Today. First, I need to navigate from the Dashboard to the Reports section. The accessibility tree shows a top navigation menubar with a link labeled "REPORTS" (bid 339).

The user’s goal is to identify the customer who has exactly 2 orders across the store’s entire history. We are already on the “Order Count Report” page under Reports > Customers. The table currently shows “We can't find records for this period,” which means we need to set an appropriate date range and refresh the report.

Per the Task Tips, the store has been operating since 2022, and for entire history we should set the date From 01/01/2022 to Today. Also, Tip 10 suggests using the Order Count page and setting "Show By" to Year for historical stats. After setting the date range and selecting Year, we’ll refresh and then look for the customer(s) with exactly 2 orders.

The step-by-step plan:
1) Enter From date as 01/01/2022 in the From textbox (bid 719).
2) Enter To date as today’s date (12/16/2025) in the To textbox (bid 726).
3) Change “Show By” to Year via the combobox (bid 733).
4) Click the Refresh button (bid 737).
5) Review the report to find the customer with an Orders count of 2 and report the full name.

Since only one action is allowed at a time, I’ll start by filling the From date field.

The user’s goal is to identify the customer(s) who have exactly 2 orders across the store’s entire history. I am on the Magento Admin “Order Count Report” page under Reports > Customers, with the date range set from 01/01/2022 to 12/16/2025 and Show By set to Year, which matches the “entire history” criteria per the tips. The table is populated with results for 2022 and 2023 (no records for 2024–2025).

To answer, I need to aggregate each customer’s Orders across all years and find those whose total equals 2. Reviewing the table:

2022 entries with 2 orders:
- Lisa Kim (2)
- Katie Wong (2)
- Brian Smith (2)
- Alexander Thomas (2)
- [Also “Jane Smith (2)” appears but Jane Smith also has 8 orders in 2022 and 1 in 2023, so not 2 total.]

2023 entries with 2 orders:
- John Smith (2), Bob Jones (2), Samantha Jones (2), Lily Potter (2), Ava Brown (2), Adam Garcia (2), Alex Martin (2)
All of these have >0 orders in 2022, so totals >2.

Check cross-year totals:
- Lisa Kim: 2 in 2022, none in 2023 → total 2.
- Brian Smith: 2 in 2022, none in 2023 → total 2.
- Julia Williams: 1 in 2022 + 1 in 2023 → total 2.
- Lisa Green: 1 in 2022 + 1 in 2023 → total 2.
- Katie Wong: 2 in 2022 + 1 in 2023 → total 3 (exclude).
- Alexander Thomas: 2 in 2022 + 1 in 2023 → total 3 (exclude).

Thus, the customers with exactly 2 orders across the entire history are: Lisa Kim, Brian Smith, Julia Williams, and Lisa Green. I will send this list to the user with full names as required.

The user’s goal is to identify the customer(s) who have exactly 2 orders across the store’s entire history. I am on the Magento Admin “Order Count Report” page under Reports > Customers, with the date range set from 01/01/2022 to 12/16/2025 and Show By set to Year, which matches the “entire history” criteria per the tips. The table is populated with results for 2022 and 2023 (no records for 2024–2025).

To answer, I need to aggregate each customer’s Orders across all years and find those whose total equals 2. Reviewing the table:

2022 entries with 2 orders:
- Lisa Kim (2)
- Katie Wong (2)
- Brian Smith (2)
- Alexander Thomas (2)
- [Also “Jane Smith (2)” appears but Jane Smith also has 8 orders in 2022 and 1 in 2023, so not 2 total.]

2023 entries with 2 orders:
- John Smith (2), Bob Jones (2), Samantha Jones (2), Lily Potter (2), Ava Brown (2), Adam Garcia (2), Alex Martin (2)
All of these have >0 orders in 2022, so totals >2.

Check cross-year totals:
- Lisa Kim: 2 in 2022, none in 2023 → total 2.
- Brian Smith: 2 in 2022, none in 2023 → total 2.
- Julia Williams: 1 in 2022 + 1 in 2023 → total 2.
- Lisa Green: 1 in 2022 + 1 in 2023 → total 2.
- Katie Wong: 2 in 2022 + 1 in 2023 → total 3 (exclude).
- Alexander Thomas: 2 in 2022 + 1 in 2023 → total 3 (exclude).

Thus, the customers with exactly 2 orders across the entire history are: Lisa Kim, Brian Smith, Julia Williams, and Lisa Green. I will send this list to the user with full names as required.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Reports > Customers > Order Count Report.
- Set full-history range: From “01/01/2022” (textbox id=719) to “12/16/2025” (textbox id=726).
- Set “Show By” to “Year” (combobox id=733) and refreshed (button id=737); the results table is populated (years 2022–2023; 2024–2025 show no records).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is directly on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Results table (id=750) with columns Interval (id=753), Customer (id=755), Orders (id=757), Average (id=759), Total (id=761); rows list customers by year.
  - Scope selector “All Websites” (button id=696), visible/enabled.
  - Date filters: From (textbox id=719, value=01/01/2022), To (textbox id=726, value=12/16/2025).
  - Grouping: “Show By” (combobox id=733, value=Year).
  - Refresh (button id=737), Export controls: “Export to” (combobox id=743, value=CSV) and “Export” (button id=746), both enabled.
- To answer the goal accurately, per-customer totals must be aggregated across all years shown. The UI lists orders per year and does not provide a cross-year per-customer total inline, so verification requires aggregating the same customer’s rows across 2022 and 2023.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- The agent provided an answer without verifying cross-year totals. To ensure accuracy, export and aggregate:
  - Click button id=746 “Export” (keep “Export to” combobox id=743 as CSV), then sum Orders by Customer across years in the CSV to identify those with exactly 2 total orders.
