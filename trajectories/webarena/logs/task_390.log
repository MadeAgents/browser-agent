🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward the goal. To post “lgtm” on the relevant merge request, the next step is to open the project’s Merge requests list.
- Relevant elements:
  - Project navigation link “Merge requests” (node [352], link, visible/enabled; shows count “10”).
  - Top navbar “Merge requests” (node [187], link, visible/enabled) — global, but the project-specific link [352] is preferable.
