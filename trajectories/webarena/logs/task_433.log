The user wants the product with the lowest per unit price from the two open tabs added to the cart. I already see the active tab (Tab 1) shows a price of $14.99 for 2 pieces, which is $7.495 per unit. I need to compare this to the product on Tab 0, which mentions "5pcs" in the title, but I must confirm the actual price on that tab to compute its per-unit price. Therefore, the best next step is to switch to Tab 0 to view its price details so I can compare per-unit costs and decide which to add to the cart.

✅ Current Progress: Focused on one product tab and identified its price and unit count. Computed per‑unit price: $8.99 for 5 pcs ≈ $1.80 per unit. No item has been added to the cart yet, and comparison with other open tabs is still pending.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This product page is directly relevant to the goal. Key elements:
- Price: StaticText “$8.99” (visible).
- Product units: Title includes “5pcs” (visible).
- Availability: StaticText “IN STOCK”.
- Quantity control: spinbutton labeled “Qty” [1599], current value=1 (enabled, visible).
- Add to Cart: button labeled “Add to Cart” [1601] (enabled, visible).
- Cart status: link “My Cart” [278], shows 5 items (visible).
The page provides all information needed to compute per‑unit price and proceed to add to cart if this is the lowest among open tabs.

The goal is to add the product with the lowest per unit price from the two open tabs to the cart. On the active tab (Tab 0), the product is 5 pieces for $8.99, which is $8.99/5 ≈ $1.80 per unit. To be certain this is the lowest, I need to check the price of the other open tab (Tab 1), which is a 2-piece stylus set, and compute its per-unit price. The current page shows the "Add to Cart" button, but I should only add the lowest per-unit item. Therefore, I will switch to Tab 1 to view its price so I can compare and then proceed to add the correct item to the cart.

✅ Current Progress: Identified unit prices on both product tabs. Tab 0: $8.99 for 5 pcs ≈ $1.80/unit (lowest). Current tab (Tab 1): $14.99 for 2 pcs ≈ $7.50/unit. No item has been added to the cart yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is a product detail for “Stylus pens for Touch Screens (2 Pcs)” priced at $14.99 (visible StaticText). It is relevant but not the lowest per unit option, so adding from here would be off-goal.
- Key elements on current page:
  - “Add to Cart” button [1601], visible and enabled.
  - Qty control (spinbutton) labeled “Qty” [1600], visible, current value appears 1.
  - Variant options under “Color” (radio/select controls), visible; selection state not confirmed.
  - “My Cart” link [279], visible, shows 5 items.
This tab is not on the critical path because its unit price is higher than the product on Tab 0.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Switch to Tab 0 (the 5 pcs product at $8.99) and click its “Add to Cart” button [1601], keeping Qty at 1.

The user’s goal is to add the product with the lowest per unit price from the two open tabs to the cart. On the current active tab (Tab 1), the stylus set is priced at $14.99 for 2 pieces, which is $7.495 per unit. The other tab (Tab 0) is a 5-piece dental resin brush pen set; I need to verify its price and then add it if its per unit price is lower. The prior progress summary indicates Tab 0 is $8.99 for 5 pcs (~$1.80/unit), but I should confirm on the actual product page and then proceed to add it. Since I’m currently on Tab 1, the next best step is to switch to Tab 0 to view the price and locate the “Add to Cart” button. Once on Tab 0, I can execute the add-to-cart action if it’s indeed the lowest. Only one action is allowed per step, so I will switch tabs now.
