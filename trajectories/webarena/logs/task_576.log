The first user "abisubramanya27" appears to have been added as a token inside the "Username or email address" field, shown as "Abishek S" with a close button, indicating successful selection. The next step is to add the second user "lahwaacz". The textbox for entering usernames is element [854]. After entering "lahwaacz", I will later select the suggested user (if needed), set the role combobox [865] from "Guest" to "Developer", and click "Invite". Since only one action is allowed now, I will enter "lahwaacz" in the username field.

The user wants to add two users (“abisubramanya27” and “lahwaacz”) as Developers to the a11y-webring.club project. I’m on the Project members page with the “Invite members” modal open. Both users have already been added as tokens in the “Username or email address” field. The remaining steps are to set the role to “Developer” and click “Invite”.

Previously, I attempted to select “Developer” by clicking the role combobox (bid 865) and then the “Developer” option (bid 868), but the click on the option timed out because the dropdown wasn’t expanded. I clicked the combobox again to expand it, but the accessibility tree still shows expanded=False, so relying on a click to open the dropdown may be inconsistent.

To robustly set the role to Developer, I will use the select_option action on the role combobox to directly choose “Developer”. This avoids dependency on expansion state and should change the combobox value. After this, I will click “Invite” in the following step to complete the process.
