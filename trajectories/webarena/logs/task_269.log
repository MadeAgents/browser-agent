The user wants to see products under $25 in the "women shoes" category. Per the site tips, I should use the top navigation dropdowns rather than search. The navigation shows a "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry" menu item with hasPopup, indicating it has subcategories. The correct approach is to hover over this to reveal nested options such as "Women" then "Shoes". After reaching the women shoes category, I can look for price filters to show items under $25.

✅ Current Progress:
- Hovered the top navigation “Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry” category (menuitem id=656), exposing its submenu.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page: Home page (“One Stop Market”). This is on the critical path since category navigation is needed to reach “Women Shoes”.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - menuitem “Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry” (id=656, hasPopup=menu) — currently expanded.
  - Submenu items now visible under it:
    - “Women” (menuitem id=675, hasPopup=menu, visible/enabled, not yet expanded).
    - “Men” (menuitem id=661, hasPopup=menu), “Novelty & More” (id=692), “Sport Specific Clothing” (id=700).
  - Search combobox “Search” (id=386, empty) with “Search” button (id=391, disabled) — not immediately useful for precise category filtering.
- To proceed toward the goal, the essential next interactive element is “Women” (id=675) to reveal its submenu where “Shoes” should appear, after which price filters can be applied to show items under $25.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to the goal. It shows “Shoes Items 1–12 of 4019” within Women > Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry.
- Relevant interactive elements to achieve “under $25”:
  - Sidebar filter “Shop By” > “Price” — multiple clickable price-range links (visible/enabled). Selecting a range with a maximum at or below $25 will constrain results accordingly. (Visible text identifier: “Price” under “Shopping Options”.)
  - Sort control: combobox “Sort By” (id=1504, current value=Position; options include “Price”). Useful for ordering but does not filter to under $25.
  - “Set Descending Direction” toggle (id=1508) adjacent to Sort; not required for filtering.
  - Search field: combobox “Search” (id=388), with “Search” button disabled (id=393); not needed for category price filtering.
- No errors or blockers detected; the page is appropriate for applying a price filter to meet the goal.

The user wants to see products under $25 within the Women > Shoes category. I’m already on the Women Shoes category page. To meet the “under $25” requirement, I should apply a price filter. The left sidebar shows a “Price” facet with ranges. Although the only visible option right now is “$0.00 - $99.99,” clicking it often causes Magento’s layered navigation to recalculate and present narrower ranges (e.g., $0–$24.99, $25–$49.99). This is the fastest path toward reaching an “under $25” filter without scrolling. After this click, I can look for a specific sub-$25 option to click next. So the next best action is to click the “$0.00 - $99.99” price range under “Shopping Options”.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path toward the goal. It lists Women’s Shoes products (“Shoes Items 1–12 of 3706”).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Sidebar “Shopping Options” > “Price”: multiple clickable price-range links (visible/enabled), including narrower ranges appropriate for “under $25” (e.g., “$0.00 - $24.99”).
  - “Now Shopping By” shows the currently applied filter “$0.00 - $99.99” with a “Remove This Item” link (visible/enabled).
  - Sort controls (“Sort By” combobox value=Position, id=1504) are available but not needed for filtering by price.
- Current filter ($0–$99.99) is too broad and does not guarantee “under $25”.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the price filter link labeled “$0.00 - $24.99” under “Shopping Options” > “Price” to restrict results to under $25.
- If the narrower range cannot be selected due to the existing filter, first click “Remove This Item” in “Now Shopping By”, then click the “$0.00 - $24.99” price link.

The user wants to see products under $25 in the Women > Shoes category. I’m already on the correct category page (breadcrumb confirms Women > Shoes). The sidebar shows “Shopping Options” with price ranges. To ensure the URL reflects a max price below $25 (as per the benchmark tip), I should apply a price filter whose upper bound is less than 25. The available ranges include:

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page is on the critical path toward the goal. However, the current price filter excludes items priced $20.00–$24.99, so it does not fully satisfy “under $25.”

The user wants to see products under $25 in the Women > Shoes category. I’m on the correct category page. To filter to items under $25, I should use the left “Shopping Options” sidebar and apply a price filter. Currently, the only visible price ranges are broad, including “$0.00 - $99.99.” In Magento layered navigation, clicking a broad range like $0–$99.99 typically refines the available ranges to narrower brackets (e.g., $0–$9.99, $10–$19.99, $20–$29.99). Therefore, the next step is to click the “$0.00 - $99.99” link to reveal narrower price options, after which I can choose a range that ensures the max price is below $25.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the correct category: Women > Shoes (breadcrumb shows Home > Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry > Women > Shoes; heading “Shoes”).
- A price filter is currently applied, but it is broad: “$0.00 - $99.99,” which does not meet the “under $25” requirement.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path toward the goal (Women Shoes category grid visible: “Items 1–12 of 3706”).
- Active filter: “Now Shopping By > Price: $0.00 - $99.99” with a “Remove This Item” link (id: 1930, visible/enabled).
- Relevant interactive elements to achieve “under $25”:
  - Price facet options (all visible/enabled):
    - “$0.00 - $9.99” (id: 1941) — suitable (max < $25).
    - “$10.00 - $19.99” (id: 1947) — suitable (max < $25).
    - “$20.00 - $29.99” (id: 1953) — not suitable (includes prices above $25).
  - Sort control (not required): “Sort By” combobox (id: 1504), currently “Position”.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click “Remove This Item” in the “Now Shopping By” section (id: 1930) to clear the broad $0–$99.99 filter.
- Then click the “$10.00 - $19.99” price option (id: 1947) to display products under $25. (Alternatively, “$0.00 - $9.99” with id: 1941 is also valid.)

The user wants to see Women > Shoes products under $25. I’m already in the correct category (breadcrumb shows Women > Shoes). The current URL has a price filter of 0–100 (shown in “Now Shopping by: Price $0.00 - $99.99”). The left sidebar offers preset ranges ($0–9.99, $10–19.99, $20–29.99, etc.), but none cleanly cover the entire “under $25” span (0–24.99). Selecting $10–19.99 would exclude items priced $20–24.99, which does not fully meet the intent. 

Given the benchmark tip that evaluation is based on the URL for “show me products under a price,” the most precise approach is to directly set the URL price parameter to 0–25. This will ensure the page displays items under $25 and the URL reflects the correct upper bound. Therefore, I will navigate directly to the same category URL with price=0-25.
