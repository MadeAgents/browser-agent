The user wants to update order #299 with a Federal Express tracking number. From the Dashboard, the "Last Orders" section lists an entry with a link for order_id/299 (Sarah Miller). The quickest way is to click that order to open its detail page. On Magento, adding tracking is done during shipment creation or by adding tracking to an existing shipment. I should first navigate to the order view page by clicking the row corresponding to order_id/299. Then, on the next steps, I'll look for "Ship" or an existing shipment with "Add Tracking Number". For now, I will click the row that links to the order view page.

✅ Current Progress: Opened Order #000000299 in Magento Admin and navigated to the “Shipments” view; confirmed there are no shipments for this order.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to adding a tracking number, which must be attached to a shipment. The “Shipments” tab panel [1980] shows:
- Results table [2319] with message “We couldn't find any records.” [2353] → no existing shipment to attach tracking.
- Controls in the Shipments view: 
  - “Search by keyword” textbox [2084] (empty, enabled)
  - “Search” button [2085] (enabled)
  - “Filters” button [2089] (enabled)
  - “Actions” button [2272] (enabled; no selections available)
  - “Export” button [2069] (enabled)
- Global/top buttons: “Back” [741], “Login as Customer” [743], “Reorder” [745] (all visible, enabled; not directly relevant to tracking).
- Left navigation under ORDER VIEW includes “Information” link [2366]/[2367] (visible, clickable), which is typically where a “Ship” action would be available to create a shipment.
- Note: A prior view indicated the order status was “Canceled” [769]; if this remains true, shipment creation (and thus adding tracking) may be blocked. Reconfirm status on the Information tab before proceeding.

✅ Current Progress: Opened Order #000000299 in Magento Admin. Viewed the Information tab and confirmed the order status is “Canceled.” Previously verified there are no shipments for this order.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is the correct order detail view, but it does not expose any “Ship” or “Add Tracking” actions. Key elements:
- Order Status: “Canceled” [769] (non-interactive display).
- Left ORDER VIEW navigation: “Information” [2366/2367] (active), “Invoices” [2380], “Credit Memos” [2411], “Shipments” [2433].
- Top buttons: “Back” [741], “Login as Customer” [743], “Reorder” [745] (visible).
- Notes for this Order:
  - “Status” dropdown [1098] showing “Canceled”.
  - “Comment” textbox [1071] (empty, visible).
  - “Notify Customer by Email” checkbox [1072] and “Visible on Storefront” checkbox [1073] (visible).
  - “Submit Comment” button [1081] (visible).
- Shipments for this order are absent (confirmed earlier), and with the order in “Canceled” state, creating a shipment—and thus attaching a tracking number—is blocked. Therefore, the standard path to add a carrier tracking number is not available.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Since shipment-based tracking cannot be added to a canceled order, record the tracking in the order notes: type “Federal Express tracking number 8974568499” into the “Comment” field [1071] and click “Submit Comment” [1081]. Optionally check “Notify Customer by Email” [1072] before submitting.

The user’s goal is to update order #299 with a Federal Express tracking number. I’m on the order view page for #000000299 in Magento Admin.
