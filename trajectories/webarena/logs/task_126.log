The user wants the price range for Canon photo printers on One Stop Market. I’m already on the search results page for “Canon photo printer,” which lists multiple Canon photo printer products with prices.

Visible Canon printer items and prices:
- Canon PIXMA MG2120 Color Photo Printer with Scanner and Copier — $2.56 (lowest)
- Canon TS202 Inkjet Photo Printer, Black — $49.54
- Canon PIXMA MP560 Wireless Inkjet All-In-One Photo Printer — $56.78
