The user wants me to create a post asking for recommendations for must-have life products under $30 in the most appropriate subreddit (forum). I need to locate the forum that best fits product recommendations on this Postmill instance. The homepage shows various forums (MachineLearning, books, pittsburgh, consoles, space), but none are clearly suited for general product recommendations. The tips mention that to find a relevant subreddit/forum, I should go to the "Forum" tab and look for an alphabetical list.

Other listed forums (e.g., technology, gaming, movies) are visible but less aligned with a general “must-have under $30” product recommendations request. The page content appears relevant; no errors or login walls detected.

The user wants to create a post asking for product recommendations under $30 in the most appropriate forum. From the List of forums page, the best fit for broad recommendations is “AskReddit,” which is designed for general questions to the community. To ensure the post goes to the correct forum, I should first navigate into the AskReddit forum rather than using the generic Submit link in the header. On this page, I see the “AskReddit — AskReddit” link (bid 144). The next step is to click that link to enter the AskReddit forum, where I can then find the forum-specific submit option to compose the post. I will avoid scrolling per instructions and directly click the visible AskReddit forum link.

The user wants me to create a post requesting recommendations for must-have products under $30 in the most appropriate forum. We already navigated to the "Create submission" page with the Forum set to "AskReddit," which is suitable for general recommendations. The submission form shows:
- URL/Image selector, with URL selected (we will leave the URL field empty per the site tips).
- Title textbox (required).
- Body textbox.
- Forum combobox set to AskReddit.
- Create submission button.

Following the benchmark tips, when creating a post, all content should go into the Body and the URL field should remain empty. I need to first populate the Title, then the Body, and finally click Create submission. Since only one action is allowed per step, the best next action is to fill the Title field with a clear, concise question that includes the budget. I will use: "What are your must-have products that improved your life for under $30?" This aligns with the user’s request and sets up the next step to fill the Body.

The task is to post a recommendation request for must-have products under $30 in the most appropriate subreddit (forum). I navigated to the Forums page, chose AskReddit as a suitable general forum, and opened the “Create submission” form. The Title and Body fields are already completed with appropriate content, the URL field is empty (as advised), and the Forum selector is set to AskReddit. 

However, the page shows a rate limit notice: “You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again,” which means attempting to submit now would fail. Repeating the submit click would be futile.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the “Create submission” page with Forum set to AskReddit.
- Title and Body fields are fully composed with the $30 product recommendations request.
- Forum selector has been opened to choose the most appropriate subreddit.
- Submission currently blocked by site rate limit.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to the goal (posting the question).
- Blocking notice present: “You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.” (list item [122]).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Title textbox (id: 142): filled; required; visible.
  - Body textbox (id: 147): filled; visible.
  - URL radio (id: 124): selected; URL field (id: 132) empty (acceptable for text post).
  - Forum combobox (id: 389): expanded=True; visible. Listbox (id: 465) shows options including:
    - “reddit” (id: 544) — currently highlighted.
    - “science” (id: 552) — visible, selectable.
    - “gadgets” (id: 557) — visible, selectable; likely a more appropriate target for product recommendations.
- Create submission button was previously clicked (id: 401), but posting is rate-limited and will not succeed until the cooldown ends.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click option “gadgets” in the Forum dropdown (id: 557) to target a more appropriate subreddit for product recommendations. After the cooldown lifts, click the “Create submission” button (id: 401) to post.

The user’s goal is to post a recommendation request for must-have life-improving products under $30 in the most appropriate forum. I’m on the Create submission page with the Title and Body already filled. The forum combobox is currently expanded and shows many options, including “BuyItForLife,” which is a product-focused community emphasizing durable, worthwhile items—well aligned with the post’s emphasis on durability and everyday usefulness. Given this, “BuyItForLife” is more appropriate than the broad “AskReddit.” The page shows a rate-limit notice preventing immediate submission, but I can still set the forum to the most appropriate one.

The user’s goal is to post a recommendation request in the most appropriate subreddit/forum for must-have life-improving products under $30. I’ve navigated to the Create submission page, filled the Title and Body with appropriate content, and set the Forum combobox to “BuyItForLife,” which is a better fit than a general forum like AskReddit for durable, worthwhile products—matching the user’s emphasis on durability and everyday usefulness. The page displays a blocking notice: “You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again,” indicating a rate limit that prevents submitting at this time. Repeatedly clicking “Create submission” would be futile. The best next step is to inform the user that the post is ready in BuyItForLife and ask whether to wait for the cooldown to submit or make any edits.

The user’s goal is to post a recommendation request for must-have life-improving products under $30 in the most appropriate forum. I navigated to the Create submission page and ensured the content is fully prepared:
- Title is filled with a concise question including the $30 budget.
- Body clearly asks for recommendations and emphasizes durability and everyday usefulness.
Per the site tips, the URL field is left empty. To choose the most appropriate forum, I opened the forum selector and set it to “BuyItForLife,” which is focused on durable, worthwhile purchases—more targeted than a broad forum like AskReddit and directly aligned with the user’s criteria.

The page displays a blocking notice: “You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.” This indicates a rate limit preventing immediate submission. Repeatedly clicking “Create submission” would likely be futile, and prior attempts have already indicated the limitation. The best next step is to inform the user that the post is ready in BuyItForLife but cannot be submitted right now due to rate limiting, and ask how they want to proceed (wait to submit when cooldown lifts or make edits).

Therefore, I will send a concise status update and ask for their preference.

The user’s goal is to post a recommendation request for must-have life-improving products under $30 in the most appropriate forum. On the current "Create submission" page, the Title and Body fields are already filled appropriately, and the Forum combobox shows "BuyItForLife," which aligns well with durable, worthwhile products—more appropriate than a broad forum. There is a rate-limit notice: "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." Nevertheless, the next logical step to complete the task is to attempt to submit the prepared post by clicking the "Create submission" button. I haven’t clicked this specific button id (406) yet, so it’s worth attempting once to see if it goes through despite the notice. If it fails, I can inform the user afterward.
