The user asks for the total count of Not Approved reviews across all reviews. Based on the Task Tips, the best place is MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews, where review counts can be observed and filters can be applied. From the Dashboard page, I see the top horizontal navigation bar with "MARKETING" as an option (bid 226). The plan:
1) Click MARKETING to open the Marketing menu.
2) Then look for "User Content" and specifically "All Reviews".
3) Once on the reviews page, filter or select "Not Approved" and read the total count (likely shown as "X records found" or via a status tab count).
For now, the first step is to click the MARKETING menu item to navigate to the relevant section.

From the current Dashboard view, the MARKETING overlay is open and I can see "All Reviews" (bid 287) under User Content. The correct flow is to navigate to All Reviews first; once there, I can filter the Status to "Not Approved" and then read the total count from the grid (it typically shows a record count like "X records found").

The goal is to find the total number of Not Approved reviews. I’m already on the Reviews grid in Magento Admin (Marketing > User Content > All Reviews). The grid shows a filter row, including a Status filter combobox with options: Approved, Pending, Not Approved. The page also displays a “records found” count that updates after applying filters. 

To get the count:
1) Open the Status filter dropdown (combobox [815]).
2) Select “Not Approved” (option [819]).
3) Click the “Search” button ([700]) to apply the filter.
4) Read the updated “records found” value.
