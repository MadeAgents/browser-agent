✅ Current Progress: Reached the “Create new project” page but no template selected and project details (name/visibility) not set yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to create a Jekyll project. Key interactive elements:
- Link [248] “Create from template” — visible/enabled; needed to access Jekyll templates.
- Link [241] “Create blank project” — visible/enabled; not optimal for using a Jekyll template.
- Link [255] “Import project” — visible/enabled; not relevant to using a template.
- Link [263] “Show command” — visible/enabled; optional, not needed for template-based setup.
Note: The prior click targeted heading [252] (“Create from template” heading), which is non-interactive. The actionable element is the link [248].

➡️ Next-step Guidance: Click link [248] “Create from template” to proceed to template selection (where you can choose the Jekyll template, then set name to “11711_gitlab” and visibility to Private).

The goal is to create a private repository named "11711_gitlab" using the appropriate Jekyll template. We are on the "Create from template" page, and I see two Jekyll-related options: "Pages/Jekyll" and "Netlify/Jekyll." Since the user likely wants a standard GitLab Pages setup rather than Netlify CI/CD, the correct choice is "Pages/Jekyll." For each template, there is a "Use template" radio button. The "Pages/Jekyll" entry corresponds to elements [496] (title) and [502] (radio "Use template"). Selecting this radio should choose the Jekyll template and then reveal or enable the form to set project details (name, visibility). The next best action is to select the "Use template" radio for "Pages/Jekyll" to proceed with template-based project creation.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to create a Jekyll project using a template. Relevant interactive elements:

No project details form (e.g., project name, visibility settings) is visible in the current view; after selecting the template, the next step will require locating and filling those fields (set name to “11711_gitlab” and visibility to Private) and submitting the creation.

The goal is to create a private Jekyll repository named "11711_gitlab" using the appropriate template. We are on the "Create from template" page and identified “Pages/Jekyll” with the radio input [502] to select “Use template.” My previous attempt to click the radio [502] failed due to a span element [503] intercepting pointer events, as indicated by the error log. This suggests the blue “Use template” button is implemented as a label/span overlay for the radio, so clicking the overlay span [503] should correctly select the template. After successfully selecting the Jekyll template, I expect the page to reveal or enable the project details form (name and visibility), which we will fill in next.

The user wants a private Jekyll repository named "11711_gitlab" using the appropriate template. We are on the "Create from template" page with the "Pages/Jekyll" template already selected and both the Project name and slug set to "11711_gitlab". The remaining requirement is to set visibility to Private. Previously, clicking the Private radio input [770] failed because its associated label [771] intercepted pointer events. In such cases, clicking the label element itself typically toggles the radio. Therefore, to set the project visibility to Private, I will click the label [771] for the Private option.
