The task is to change the title of the CMS page "Privacy Policy". I’m already on the CMS Pages grid under Content > Pages. I can see the row for the page titled "Privacy Policy" with an Action column containing a "Select" button (bid 1571). In Magento, clicking "Select" reveals row actions such as "Edit." The next logical step is to click this "Select" button to access the edit option for that specific page. After that, I will choose "Edit" and change the Title field to "No privacy policy is needed in this dystopian world," then save. For now, I will initiate by clicking "Select" on the "Privacy Policy" row.
