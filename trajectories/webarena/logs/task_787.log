 <think>
The user asks for the number of followers of the contributor with the most commits to branch main. On GitLab, “main” often means “master,” and the page shows “Commits to master.” The contributor list shows “Henning Leutz” with 51 commits, which is the highest. To find the follower count, I need to navigate to Henning Leutz’s profile page. The breadcrumb at the top includes a clickable link “Henning Leutz” [481], which likely leads to the user/namespace page. The next logical step is to click that link to access their profile and then look for the follower count.

 <think>
The user wants the number of followers of the contributor with the most commits to branch main. From the prior context, the top contributor for commits to main (noted as master per tips) is Henning Leutz. I navigated to Henning Leutz’s profile, which is currently displayed. On this page, the follower count is explicitly shown as a link labeled “0 followers” (element [266]). Since the required information is visible and matches the task, the next step is to provide the answer directly to the user. No further navigation is needed.
