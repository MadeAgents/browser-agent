The user asks for the total number of reviews the shop has received since the beginning. According to the provided tips, the correct place to find review counts is MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews. I already opened the Marketing menu, and I can see the "All Reviews" link (bid 287) in the User Content section. Clicking "All Reviews" should navigate to the reviews grid where Magento typically displays the total number of records (e.g., “X records found”), which represents the total reviews from the shop’s start. Therefore, the next best action is to click the "All Reviews" link to access that page and read the total count.
