The user wants to add the currently viewed product to their wishlist. On the product page, I can see a clear "Add to Wish List" link (element [1500]). The user is logged in (banner shows "Welcome, Emma Lopez!"), so clicking this should add the item to their wishlist or navigate to the wishlist page confirming the addition. The next best action is to click the "Add to Wish List" link.
