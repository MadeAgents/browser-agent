The user wants to find hotels around Carnegie Music Hall. On OpenStreetMap, the best first step is to locate Carnegie Music Hall using the search bar, which is already focused (bid 162). Once centered on the hall, I can use the "Query features" tool to find nearby features, including hotels, or visually identify hotel icons and click them. But first I must search for the hall to get to the correct location. I will enter "Carnegie Music Hall, Pittsburgh" into the search field to ensure we get the Pittsburgh location (per the task tips about using the Pittsburgh one when ambiguous) and then proceed to Go in a subsequent step.

The user asked to find the hotel around Carnegie Music Hall. I used the OpenStreetMap search to locate a nearby hotel and now the page shows “The Oaklander Hotel” with its full address in the Search Results panel. Since the task tips require using OpenStreetMap for full addresses including ZIP code, and the visible result includes all components (street number, street, district, city, state, ZIP, country), I can now provide the answer directly. The best next step is to send the hotel name and complete address to the user in the requested concise format.
