The user asked me to follow two users: 'convexegg' and 'yjlou'. On GitLab, following a user is typically done from the user's profile page, where a "Follow" button is available. The current page is the Projects dashboard and does not provide a way to follow users directly. Given the tips warn against using the global search bar and recommend direct navigation, the most efficient next step is to navigate directly to the profile page of 'convexegg' using a URL path likely in the format /<username>. Once on that page, I can look for and click the "Follow" button. I will first go to convexegg’s page; after that action completes, I will proceed similarly for yjlou.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated directly to the GitLab profile page of the first target user, convexegg. No follow actions have been taken yet; yjlou not addressed.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal (profile page for Convex Eggtart/@convexegg). Key interactive elements:
- [240] button 'Follow' — visible and enabled; clicking this will follow convexegg.
- [236] link 'Subscribe' — visible; not required for following.
- [283] link 'Followers' and [285] link 'Following' — visible; optional navigation.
- [112] textbox 'Search GitLab' — visible; not required for this task.

After following convexegg, the next step will be to navigate to the yjlou profile and follow there.

The user's goal is to follow both 'convexegg' and 'yjlou'. I have already navigated to the profile page for 'convexegg' and can see a prominent "Follow" button labeled [240] in the accessibility tree, indicating it’s actionable. Since I’m logged in as Byte Blaze (visible in the header), clicking this button should follow 'convexegg'. This is the immediate next step before navigating to 'yjlou'’s profile to repeat the process.

The goal is to follow both 'convexegg' and 'yjlou'. I already navigated to 'convexegg' and clicked the follow button; it now shows "Unfollow," confirming success. The remaining task is to follow 'yjlou'. The most efficient way, similar to the previous step, is to navigate directly to the user's profile via URL, using the pattern /<username>.
