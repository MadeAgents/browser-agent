The user asks for the main criticisms of the product. On the product page, there is a "Reviews (3)" tab which likely contains user reviews where criticisms would be found. To extract relevant sentences, I should first open the Reviews tab to view the content. The accessibility tree shows a tab 'Reviews (3)' with a link [1668] that should expand the reviews section. The plan: click the Reviews (3) tab to reveal the reviews, then evaluate and extract sentences that are critical (negative points) from the displayed reviews.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the “Reviews (3)” tab; the Customer Reviews section is visible with all three reviews displayed.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current product page is directly relevant to the goal (extracting main criticisms from reviews). The “Reviews (3)” tab (element id=1668) is active, revealing the review content. No additional interaction is required to access the critiques.
- Relevant elements:
  - Tab “Reviews (3)” (id=1668): Open/visible.
  - Customer review blocks (visible in the Reviews section): contain the sentences needed for extraction.
- Visible critical/negative sentences present in the reviews:
  - “Dry/Uneven color”
  - “Those labial never came to me and I would like them again because I paid for them”
- Other elements (e.g., “Add Your Review” link id=1538, rating display, search controls) are not needed for extracting criticisms.

The user asks for the main criticisms of the product and to extract the relevant sentences. I’m already on the product page, and the “Reviews (3)” tab is open with all reviews visible, as shown in the accessibility tree and screenshot. I should identify negative feedback sentences from the displayed reviews. Among the three reviews, one is clearly positive (“Love this lipgloss!...”), one is a customer service/shipping complaint (“Those labial never came to me...”), and one is a product-quality criticism (“DryUneven color”). The task specifies extracting relevant sentences, so I will quote exactly the negative sentences from the reviews as they appear on the page. No further navigation or interaction is needed; I will send the extracted sentences to the user.
