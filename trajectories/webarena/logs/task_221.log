- Textbox “Search” ([162]) — filled with “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA”; visible and editable.
- Button “Go” ([165]) — visible; currently focused.
- Link “Find directions between two points” ([167]) — visible; opens the routing interface needed to compute travel times.
- Search Results list shows “Carnegie Mellon University…” ([481]) — visible; can be used to confirm/select the origin.
- Link “More results” ([483]) — visible; for broader search results if needed.

The page is on the critical path toward the goal. To proceed, the routing interface must be opened and a nearby USPS/post office selected as the destination, then travel times can be computed for different modes.

The user wants the travel time from CMU to the nearest USPS office using different transportation methods. On OpenStreetMap, the most efficient approach is to use the search bar to find "USPS" locations near the current map center (which is already centered around CMU). Then, I can identify the nearest USPS among the search results and use the directions tool to compute travel times for different modes (driving, walking, cycling, etc.). The search textbox (bid 162) is present and currently contains "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA". I should replace it with "USPS" to get nearby postal offices. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next optimal action is to fill the search field with "USPS".

The user needs travel times from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to the nearest USPS postal office using different transportation methods. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open, with the "To" field set to CMU and the "From" field empty. To compute routes from CMU to a USPS location, the origin should be CMU. The most efficient next step is to click the "Reverse Directions" button so that "From" becomes CMU and "To" becomes empty. After that, I can enter "USPS" into the "To" field, choose the nearest USPS, and then switch modes (Car/Bicycle/Foot) to read travel times. Since only a single action is allowed, I will reverse the directions now.

The directions panel is open with the origin set to a CMU landmark (“Walking to the Sky...”) and the destination textbox filled with “USPS.” To compute a route, OpenStreetMap typically requires submitting the destination query.

The user wants travel times from CMU Pittsburgh to the nearest USPS office for different transportation methods. The directions panel is already set with From: a CMU landmark (“Walking to the Sky…”) and To: “USPS, Atwood Street, Oakland… Pittsburgh, PA 15213”, which is a local USPS. In the route summary, Car mode is selected and shows Distance 2.1km and Time 0:03. To get the times for other modes, I should toggle the mode radio buttons in the directions panel. The Bicycle radio [176] is present and unchecked; clicking it should recalculate the route and update the time and distance for cycling. After this, I can switch to Foot [179] to get the walking time. Since only one action is allowed right now, the optimal next step is to click the Bicycle radio to compute the cycling time.

✅ Current Progress:
- Origin and destination are set: From = “Walking to the Sky, Forbes Avenue, … Pittsburgh, PA” (CMU), To = “USPS, Atwood Street, Oakland, … Pittsburgh, PA 15213”.
- Car mode route computed with Distance = 2.1 km and Time = 0:03.
- Bicycle mode radio was clicked to obtain cycling time (not yet reflected in the visible state).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The OpenStreetMap Directions panel is directly aligned with the goal of comparing travel times by transport modes from CMU to the nearest USPS.
- Relevant interactive elements and states:
  - [194] textbox “From” — filled; visible and enabled.
  - [199] textbox “To” — filled with the USPS destination; focused; visible and enabled.
  - Mode radios — [173] “Car” (checked=true), [176] “Bicycle” (enabled, unchecked), [179] “Foot” (enabled, unchecked).
  - [182] combobox “Directions services” — value='OSRM'; enabled; not expanded.
  - Route summary — [600] Distance shows “2.1km”; [601] Time shows “0:03” for the current mode.
- The page is correctly positioned to read and compare times; switching the mode radios (Bicycle, Foot) should update the time and distance fields.

The user asks for travel times from CMU Pittsburgh to the nearest USPS office for different transportation methods. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already set: From = “Walking to the Sky…” (a CMU landmark), To = “USPS, Atwood Street, Oakland… Pittsburgh, PA 15213”, which is a local USPS. The route summary shows Distance 2.1km and Time 0:03, with the Car mode radio [173] currently checked. To get times for other modes, I need to switch modes to Bicycle and Foot.

My last attempt to click the Bicycle radio input [176] failed due to the Car label [174] intercepting pointer events. The accessibility tree shows a separate “LabelText 'Bicycle'” element [177], which likely toggles the bicycle mode when clicked. To avoid the interception issue, I will click the Bicycle label [177] instead of the radio input. Once Bicycle mode is activated, the time and distance fields ([600] Distance, [601] Time) should update, and I can read them before switching to Foot in a subsequent step.
