The user is asking for the total count of Pending reviews. Based on the Magento Admin dashboard, I should navigate to the section where review information is available. The Task Tips indicate that review counts are found under MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews. I am currently on the Dashboard, and I can see the MARKETING menu item in the top navigation (bid 226). The next logical step is to click MARKETING to open its submenu, where I can then proceed to "User Content" and "All Reviews" to find the pending reviews count. Since only one action is allowed per step, I will click the MARKETING link first.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the “MARKETING” menu on the Dashboard, revealing the “User Content” options.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward the goal. The Marketing overlay shows the relevant navigation links needed to access review data:
- Link “All Reviews” (id: 287) — visible, clickable.
- Link “Pending Reviews” (id: 290) — visible, clickable.
Accessing either will lead to the reviews grid; “Pending Reviews” should display the filtered list where the total count can be read.

The user asks for the total count of Pending reviews. From the Dashboard, the Marketing menu overlay is currently open and shows "User Content" with two relevant links: "All Reviews" and "Pending Reviews". To find the pending count, the most direct path is to click "Pending Reviews" which should load a grid filtered to pending status and display a "X records found" count. I will navigate to the "Pending Reviews" page first to retrieve the total count.
