The user wants the page of the longest bridge in the Western hemisphere on the map. The known longest continuous bridge over water in the Western hemisphere is the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in Louisiana. The OpenStreetMap page is currently open with a visible and focused Search textbox (bid 162), along with a Go button (bid 165). The most efficient path is to use the search bar rather than manually navigating. I will enter "Lake Pontchartrain Causeway" into the search field first, then in the next step click Go to execute the search.

✅ Current Progress: Entered “Lake Pontchartrain Causeway” into the Search field.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current OpenStreetMap page is relevant to the goal. Key interactive elements:
- [162] textbox labeled “Search” — value set to “Lake Pontchartrain Causeway”, focused, visible.
- [165] button “Go” — visible and clickable; this should execute the search for the entered term.
- [217] button “Close” — closes the “Welcome to OpenStreetMap!” overlay; not strictly necessary but available if the overlay obstructs results.
The page appears on the critical path toward finding the map page for the longest bridge in the Western hemisphere. No deviations detected.

The goal is to find the OpenStreetMap page for the longest bridge in the Western hemisphere. The longest continuous bridge over water in the Western hemisphere is the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway. The search textbox [162] is already filled with "Lake Pontchartrain Causeway" and is focused. The next logical step is to execute the search to navigate to the relevant map location or feature page. The "Go" button [165] is visible and should trigger the search. The welcome overlay exists but does not obstruct the "Go" button; if it interferes later, I can close it. Therefore, I will click the "Go" button to perform the search and load the bridge’s page on the map.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current OpenStreetMap page is directly relevant to the goal. Key interactive elements:
- [481] link “Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, United States” — categorized as “Bridge”; visible in the Search Results list.
- [483], [485], [487], [489], [491], [493], [495] links — categorized as “Trunk Road”; visible alternatives referring to the causeway.
- [497] link “More results” — visible; expands search options if needed.
- [162] textbox “Search” — value remains “Lake Pontchartrain Causeway”.
This page is on the critical path; selecting the “Bridge” result [481] should lead to the bridge’s feature page on the map. No deviations detected.
