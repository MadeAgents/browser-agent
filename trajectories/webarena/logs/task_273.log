  - Search combobox “Search” (id: 386): visible, empty; Search button (id: 391) is disabled, so search is not currently actionable.
- To show products under $199 in the desired category, the agent must first enter “Furniture” (id: 713) and locate an “accent” subcategory (if present) or open Furniture’s submenu, then use price filters on the category page. No price filters are available on the current homepage.

Task: Show products under $199 in the “accent furniture” category. We are already on the “Accent Furniture - Furniture - Home & Kitchen” category page (confirmed by the breadcrumb and page title). According to the benchmark tips, to show products under a price, we should apply a price filter so the URL reflects the constraint. The left sidebar “Shop By” → “Price” section shows multiple price range links. While the accessibility tree lists wide ranges, the visible UI typically shows finer ranges (e.g., $0–$49.99, $50–$99.99, $100–$199.99). The most direct way to ensure results under $199 is to click the price range that caps at ~$199 (commonly labeled “$100.00 - $199.99”). This should update the page and URL to reflect a max around 199. I will click the third price range link in the list (bid 1842), which typically corresponds to $100–$199.99, to filter the category results to items under ~$199. If needed, I can refine further afterward.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the correct category: “Accent Furniture” under “Furniture > Home & Kitchen.”
- A price filter is applied, but it is incorrect for the goal: “$2,000.00 – $2,999.99.” No items under $199 are shown.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to the goal (it’s the Accent Furniture category listing).
- Current filters and results:
  - “Now Shopping by” shows “$2,000.00 – $2,999.99” with a “Remove This Item” link (visible/clickable).
  - Product grid displays 5 items, all priced above $2,000 (does not meet the <$199 goal).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Left sidebar “Shopping Options” → “Price” filter links (visible; current selection is the $2,000–$2,999.99 range).
  - “Sort By” combobox (id: 1502), options include “Position,” “Product Name,” and “Price” (enabled). Note: sorting will not filter below $199.
  - Top search field (combobox “Search”) and “Search” button (button “Search” is currently disabled), not directly useful for price filtering.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the “Remove This Item” link under “Now Shopping by” to clear the “$2,000.00 – $2,999.99” price filter.
- Then, in “Shopping Options” → “Price,” select the lowest available price range that is at or below $199 (e.g., “$0.00 – $199.99” or “$100.00 – $199.99”) if present. If no such range is available, the category likely has no products under $199; consider navigating back or choosing a different category.

The user wants to see products under $199 in the Accent Furniture category. We are already on the correct category page (breadcrumb and title confirm "Accent Furniture"). To fulfill “show me products under $199,” the benchmark tip indicates that evaluation relies on the URL reflecting the price constraint. The sidebar price filter currently shows only broad ranges (e.g., $0–$999.99) and the environment does not support scrolling, so I can’t access finer ranges like $0–$199.99 via the UI. 

Previously, when a price filter was applied, the URL used a pattern like price=2000-3000, which implies Magento accepts explicit price range parameters in the URL. Therefore, the most reliable way to ensure the page shows products priced under $199 and to satisfy the URL-based evaluation is to navigate directly to the same category URL with a price parameter capped at 199 (e.g., price=0-199). This should filter the results accordingly without needing to scroll or rely on unavailable UI ranges.

Next step: navigate to the category URL with price=0-199 appended.
