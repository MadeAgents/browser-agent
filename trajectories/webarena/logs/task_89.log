The user asks a straightforward geography question: which US states border Connecticut. This is general knowledge—Connecticut borders three states: New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. The current page is OpenStreetMap's homepage centered on Hong Kong; using the map to locate Connecticut would require multiple steps and isn't necessary given the simplicity of the question. The best next action is to provide the answer directly via a message to the user, ensuring a concise list as requested.
