✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “My Account” dashboard where recent orders and address information are visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward changing the delivery address for the most recent order. Key interactive elements:
- “Recent Orders” section: The screenshot shows a table listing orders with an “Action” column containing “View Order” links (visible and clickable). These are essential to access order-specific shipping details for the latest order.
- Address Book:
  - link “Manage Addresses” [1386] (visible; enabled) — edits saved addresses for future orders.
  - link “Edit Address” [1401] under Default Billing Address (visible; enabled) — billing only.
  - link “Edit Address” [1415] under Default Shipping Address (visible; enabled) — updates the default shipping address, typically for future orders, not the current one.
Given the goal targets the most recent order specifically, the “View Order” link in the most recent row is the relevant next interaction on this page.

The goal is to change the delivery address for the most recent order. On the My Account dashboard, I can see the “Recent Orders” table listing the latest orders. The most recent one is Order #000000202 dated 12/22/25 with status “Pending.” To change the delivery address for that specific order, I first need to open the order details page. In the Action column for this row, there is a “View Order” link (bid 1490). Clicking it should take me to the order page where I can look for options to edit or change the shipping address.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the most recent order’s detail page: Order #000000202 (status: Pending; Order Date: December 22, 2025).

🔍 Current State Analysis: This is the correct order details page and on the critical path for changing its delivery address. The “Order Information” section shows the current Shipping Address as static text (Emma Lopez, 987 Sycamore Circle, Suite 300, Philadelphia, PA 19102, United States). No controls to modify the shipping address are visible within this page.
Relevant interactive elements:
- link “Reorder” [1363] — visible; enabled.
- link “Print Order” [1365] — visible; enabled.
- Left sidebar navigation (visible): “My Orders”, “Address Book”, “My Account” — enabled; these offer navigation but do not directly edit this order on this page.
- Search combobox “Search” [266] — visible; not relevant to the goal.
Overall, the page lacks an “Edit” or “Change Shipping Address” button/link for this order; further navigation may be required to find an address-change option tied to the order.

The user wants to change the delivery address for their most recent order. I’m currently on the order details page for Order #000000202 (status: Pending), which is the correct order. I examined the page’s interactive elements: it shows static Shipping Address text and provides “Reorder” and “Print Order” links, but there’s no “Edit” or “Change Shipping Address” control available on this page or adjacent sections. On Magento-style customer portals, customers typically cannot directly modify the shipping address of an already placed order from the order view; this usually requires contacting support while the order is still pending.

Given the absence of an edit option here, the most viable path is to use the site’s “Contact Us” page to request the address update with the order number and the new address. The footer contains a “Contact Us” link (bid 1627). Clicking it will take me to the contact form where I can submit the change request on behalf of the user.
