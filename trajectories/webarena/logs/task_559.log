The user wants a repository named nolan_followers with a README containing Christopher Nolan’s career timeline. On the Projects dashboard, I see an existing project "Byte Blaze / nolan_followers" listed (accessibility node [881]). To ensure we meet the goal, I should open this repository and then create or edit the README file to add the career timeline. The immediate next step is to click the repository link to access it.

✅ Current Progress: Repository “nolan_followers” is created and its README already contains a “Christopher Nolan: Career Timeline.” ✅ Task completed.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the project homepage for “Byte Blaze / nolan_followers,” which is directly on the critical path and shows the README with the timeline content. Key elements:
- Heading [618]: “nolan_followers Public” confirms the repo exists and is accessible.
- Sidebar project link [277]: “nolan_followers” (visible, enabled).
- Navigation link [301]: “Repository” (visible, enabled) for viewing files including README.md.
- Alert link [582]: “Add SSH key” (enabled) — optional for push/pull; not required for the current goal.

The user's goal is to create a repository named "nolan_followers" with a README containing Christopher Nolan’s career timeline. The current page shows the GitLab project "Byte Blaze / nolan_followers" exists and is public. The file list includes README.md, and the rendered README shows the heading "Christopher Nolan: Career Timeline" with detailed entries for early shorts and feature films, plus notes. Therefore the goal is already accomplished. The best next step is to inform the user that the repository and README are present and summarize the contents, providing the repository URL. Since only one action is allowed, I will use send_msg_to_user to confirm completion and offer to make changes if needed.
