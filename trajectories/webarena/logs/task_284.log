The user wants the least expensive shoe storage with a minimum capacity of 12 pairs. On this site, browsing via categories is recommended (tip 8). Shoe storage is likely under Home & Kitchen → Storage/Organization or similar. From the top navigation, there's a "Home & Kitchen" menu item (bid 708) with a popup menu, which likely contains the relevant subcategories. The best next step is to hover over "Home & Kitchen" to reveal its subcategories so I can navigate to shoe storage products and then filter/sort to find the least expensive option that meets the capacity requirement.

The user wants the least expensive shoe storage with at least 12 pairs capacity.

The user wants the least expensive shoe storage with a minimum capacity of 12 pairs. I’m already on the “Clothing & Closet Storage” category page sorted by Price (ascending), so the cheapest items appear first. I scanned the product titles and prices:

- “Whitmor Hanging Shoe Shelves, Pink” at $11.21 does not state capacity; likely around 10 pairs, so it may not meet the ≥12 pairs requirement.
- “Onlyeasy Over The Door Shoe Storage Organizer Hanging Shoe Rack Holder with 24 Large Fabric Pockets” at $11.97 clearly indicates 24 pockets; typical usage is one shoe per pocket, equating to 12 pairs, satisfying the requirement.
- “Over The Door Shoe Rack, 24 Large Mesh Pockets…” at $11.99 is slightly more expensive than $11.97 and also meets 12 pairs but is not the least expensive among the qualifying options.

Therefore, the cheapest item that meets at least 12 pairs appears to be the “Onlyeasy Over The Door Shoe Storage Organizer…” at $11.97. To “show” it, I should click its product link to open the detail page for confirmation and presentation.
