The user's goal is to create a new submission announcing a virtual meetup for Harry Potter enthusiasts on July 8th, and it must be posted in the "books" forum (subreddit). On the current Postmill homepage, I can see a top navigation bar with a "Submit" link (bid 63). According to the task tips, when creating a post, all content should go in the Body field and the URL field should be left empty. We'll need to select the "books" forum for the submission. The first step is to click the "Submit" link to open the submission form. After that, I will look for fields to select the forum ("books"), enter a Title (e.g., "Virtual meetup for Harry Potter enthusiasts on July 8th"), and enter the Body with the same text to ensure the content is clearly present, leaving the URL empty, and then submit. For now, I will click "Submit" to get to the form.

The user wants me to post a notice about a virtual meetup for Harry Potter enthusiasts on July 8th in the "books" forum.

Per the task tips, all content should also be placed into the Body field, leaving the URL field empty.
