The user asks for the names of customers who have expressed dissatisfaction with tanks products. In Magento Admin, reviews can be accessed via MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews (per the provided tips). From there, I can filter by product names containing "Tank" or by category (if available), and identify negative/dissatisfied reviews (likely low star ratings). The current page is the Dashboard. The left navigation includes a MARKETING option (bid [226]). My next step should be to click MARKETING to access the section where "User Content" and "All Reviews" are located. Once there, I will locate "All Reviews" and then filter for tank-related products and select reviews indicating dissatisfaction (e.g., low ratings). So the immediate action is to click the MARKETING menu item to navigate to the appropriate area.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the Marketing menu from the Magento Admin Dashboard; the “User Content” section is visible. No reviews page opened yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: We are on the Dashboard with the Marketing flyout expanded—this is on the critical path to find customer reviews related to “tank” products and identify dissatisfied customers.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link “All Reviews” (axtree node [287]) — visible, enabled/clickable.
  - Link “Pending Reviews” (axtree node [290]) — visible, enabled/clickable (less relevant since we need all dissatisfied reviews, not only pending).
The next step toward the goal is to open “All Reviews” to filter for tank-related products (e.g., “Tank”) and identify low-rated/negative reviews to extract customer names.

The user wants the names of customers who expressed dissatisfaction with tank products. I’m on the Reviews page in Magento Admin, already filtered by Product = "Tank" (27 records across 2 pages). On page 1, I can identify negative-sentiment reviews by their titles/snippets and capture the corresponding Nickname (reviewer) values: Merrie (“Not for high impact”), Shaunte (“Zero support/modesty”), Teofila (“Not for non-petite”), Emerald (“Could be flirtier.”), Carma (“The seams bother me”), Valorie (“Huge arm holes??”), Monroe (“TINY neck hole??”), Scotty (“Shirt can stink after”), Alexander (“Wish it was longer”), Dominic (“Unflattering”). I previously navigated to page 2 and saw additional dissatisfied reviews with titles like “Nothing to write home about” and “NOT for skinny dudes” with nicknames Trey and Tracey. These constitute the set of dissatisfied reviewers for tank products. The user asked specifically to show the names, so I will return the list succinctly. The correct action now is to send the answer via send_msg_to_user.
