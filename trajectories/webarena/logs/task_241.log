The user wants the most expensive product in the Skin Care Tools category. I’m already on the correct category page, confirmed by the heading “Skin Care Tools Items 1-12 of 223”. To surface the highest priced item efficiently, I should sort the product grid by price in descending order. The page provides a “Sort By” combobox (bid 1392) currently set to “Position” and a “Set Descending Direction” link (bid 1396). The correct sequence is to first change “Sort By” to “Price,” then set descending direction. I will start by selecting “Price” in the sort combobox to reorder the list by price (likely ascending initially), and in the next step I can switch to descending to show the most expensive item at the top.
