The goal is to set the GitLab status to "Out of Office." The "Set a status" modal is already open, showing a textbox labeled "What's your status?" with the current value "Resting due to leg injury" (element [1147]). The "Set yourself as busy" checkbox is already checked (which aligns with being out of office), and the clear status is set to "Never," which is acceptable unless specified otherwise. The next step is to replace the current status message with "Out of Office" in the textbox. After that, we will click "Set status" in a subsequent action.
