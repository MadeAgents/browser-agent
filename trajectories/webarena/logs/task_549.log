The user's goal is to add a new size XXXL to the green variant of the product "Minerva LumaTech V-Tee". In Magento, to add a specific size to a configurable product variant, we typically:
1) Go to Catalog > Products
2) Search for the product "Minerva LumaTech V-Tee"
3) Edit the product (which should be a Configurable Product), and use "Edit Configurations" to add a new configuration for the required attribute values (Color=Green, Size=XXXL). 
If "XXXL" is not an existing option in the Size attribute, we would first need to add it via Stores > Attributes > Product, find "Size" attribute, add "XXXL" swatch, save, then return to the product and add the configuration.

Given the current page is Dashboard, the next best step is to navigate to Catalog to access Products. From the Accessibility Tree and screenshot, the main navigation contains a "CATALOG" link [189]. Clicking it should open a menu or navigate to the Catalog area, where we can select Products. Typically in Magento, clicking the main nav item opens a submenu on the left or takes to the catalog landing page. The Task Tips emphasize using search/filter, and that adding attribute values is via Stores if needed.

So the next single action is to click the "CATALOG" navigation link to get to the products listing. I won't try to scroll since environment doesn't support scrolling and it's not needed.

If XXXL is not available as a size attribute value, I will later need to add it via Stores > Attributes > Product, but first I should navigate to the product edit page. I will click the "Edit Minerva LumaTech™ V-Tee" link (bid 5505).

The task is to add a new size XXXL to the Green variant of the configurable product “Minerva LumaTech™ V-Tee.” I’m on the product edit page, and I can see the “Configurations” section with the “Edit Configurations” button. The current variations list shows sizes XS through XL across colors Black, Blue, and Red. There’s no Green listed in the current variations, and in the Size attribute list I don’t see “XXXL,” suggesting the value may not exist yet. Per the Task Tips, the correct workflow is to start with “Edit Configurations” to add the desired configuration (Color: Green, Size: XXXL). If XXXL isn’t available in the wizard, I’ll then add the attribute value via Stores > Attributes > Product for Size, and return to complete the configuration.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Catalog > Products and opened the product edit page for “Minerva LumaTech™ V-Tee.”
- Initiated the configuration workflow by clicking “Edit Configurations” [1799] to add/update variants.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (product edit for “Minerva LumaTech™ V-Tee”) is on the critical path to add a new size/variant.
- The variations grid shown on the page lists colors Black, Blue, and Red; no Green variant is present yet. Sizes shown do not include XXXL.
- Relevant interactive elements for progressing:
  - button “Edit Configurations” [1799] — invoked to open the configuration wizard for adding Color/Size combinations.
  - button “Save” [904] — enabled; to persist changes after updating configurations.
  - button “Back” [915] — enabled.
  - button “Add Attribute” [917] — enabled (only needed if attribute adjustments are required).
- No errors or off-track indicators detected; proceeding through the configuration wizard to select Color = Green and add Size = XXXL (if available) is the correct next step. If XXXL is not offered in the wizard, it must be added to the Size attribute via Stores > Attributes > Product before completing configurations.

The goal is to add a new size XXXL for the Green variant of the configurable product “Minerva LumaTech™ V-Tee.” I’m already on the product edit page with the “Create Product Configurations” wizard open.

The correct next step in this wizard is to click the “Next” button to move to the Attribute Values selection screen, where I can select only Green and XXXL.

The user needs to add a new size value "XXXL" for the Green color in the configurable product "Minerva LumaTech™ V-Tee". I'm currently in the "Create Product Configurations" wizard at Step 2: Attribute Values. The Size list shows many options (XS, S, M, L, XL, etc.) but does not include "XXXL". According to the tips, if a desired attribute value does not exist, I must add it by going to STORES > Attributes > Product, finding the "Size" attribute, and adding the new value. Since the current wizard does not offer a way to create a new attribute value directly, I should exit the wizard before navigating to STORES to add "XXXL" to the Size attribute.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Stores > Attributes > Product (Product Attributes grid).
- Confirmed the Size attribute needs a new value “XXXL” before updating product configurations.
- Entered “size” into the Attribute Code filter textbox [759].

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to add the missing Size option.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Attribute Code filter textbox [759]: filled with “size”.
  - Search button [706]: enabled; needed to apply the filter.
  - Reset Filter button [709]: enabled.
  - Attributes table [736]: listing not yet filtered (indicator shows records found); the Size attribute row will need to be opened after applying the filter.
  - “Add New Attribute” button [696]: visible but not required (we are editing an existing attribute).
- Next logical interaction: click Search [706] to filter for the Size attribute, then open the Size attribute from the results to add option “XXXL” and save.

The goal is to add a new Size value "XXXL" to the Size attribute so we can later assign it to the Green variant of the Minerva LumaTech V-Tee. I’m on STORES > Attributes > Product, and I’ve already entered "size" into the Attribute Code filter textbox [759]. To narrow the list and bring up the "Size" attribute, I need to apply the filter.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Stores > Attributes > Product (Product Attributes grid).
- Determined the Size attribute needs the new value “XXXL” before updating product configurations.
- Entered “size” in the Attribute Code filter [759] and applied the filter by clicking Search [706].

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to enable the new Size option required for the product configuration.
- Indicators show the list is filtered (e.g., “records found 1”), suggesting the Size attribute is isolated.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Attribute Code filter textbox [759]: filled with “size”.
  - Search button [706]: enabled (already used).
  - Reset Filter button [709]: enabled.
  - Attributes table [735]: should now list the “size” attribute row; clicking that row opens the attribute for editing.
  - “Add New Attribute” button [696]: visible but not needed since we’re editing an existing attribute.
- Next logical moves (still on-track):
  1) Open the “size” attribute from the filtered results in table [735].
  2) Add the new option “XXXL” to Size, save the attribute.
  3) Return to the product (Minerva LumaTech™ V-Tee) and use Edit Configurations to add the configuration for Color = Green and Size = XXXL.

The user’s goal is to add a new size XXXL to the green Minerva LumaTech V-Tee. Per Magento workflow, we need to ensure the Size attribute has the value "XXXL" before adding it to the product configuration. We navigated to Stores > Attributes > Product, opened the "Size" attribute, and clicked "Add Swatch", which added an empty row at the bottom of the Manage Swatch table. In the accessibility tree, the new empty row shows textboxes: [1589] 'Swatch', [1591] 'Description', [1593] 'Swatch', [1595] 'Description'. Typically, the first pair corresponds to Admin and the second pair to Default Store View. We should first input "XXXL" into the first (Admin) swatch textbox [1589].

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Stores > Attributes > Product and opened the Size attribute.
- Added a new swatch value “XXXL” in the Manage Swatch table:
  - Admin “Swatch” textbox [1589]: filled with “XXXL”.
  - Default Store View “Swatch” textbox [1593]: filled with “XXXL”.
- Attempted to save, but a validation error appeared (“The value of Admin scope can't be empty.”), so the attribute change has not been saved yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path: the Size attribute must include “XXXL” before adding the Green/XXXL variant to the product.
- The page shows a validation error: “The value of Admin scope can't be empty.” This indicates at least one required “Admin” field is empty in the attribute form (likely a swatch row).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Manage Swatch (Values of Your Attribute) group [816]:
    - Admin “Swatch” textbox for the new value [1589]: currently “XXXL”, enabled/visible.
    - Default Store View “Swatch” textbox for the new value [1593]: currently “XXXL”, enabled/visible.
    - “Add Swatch” button [1235]: enabled/visible.
  - Save controls:
    - “Save Attribute” button [734]: enabled/visible.
    - “Save and Continue Edit” button [732]: enabled/visible.
- Because the error persists, the new value likely hasn’t been committed yet. We must resolve the empty Admin field(s) and save successfully before proceeding to update the product configurations.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
1) Verify and complete required fields for the new value:
   - If either is empty, type “XXXL” into the Admin “Swatch” textbox [1589] and the Default Store View “Swatch” textbox [1593].
2) Click “Save Attribute” [734] to commit the new size value. If the error persists, scan the Manage Swatch table [816] for any other swatch row with an empty Admin cell (highlighted) and fill it, then click “Save Attribute” [734] again.

The user's goal is to add a new size XXXL to the Green variant of the configurable product "Minerva LumaTech V-Tee". We navigated to Stores > Attributes > Product, opened the "Size" attribute, clicked "Add Swatch", and filled the new row's Admin and Default Store View "Swatch" fields with "XXXL". When attempting to save via "Save Attribute" [734], a validation error "The value of Admin scope can't be empty." is displayed near the Attribute Properties section. This error typically refers to the required "Default Label *" field for the attribute. Although the accessibility tree shows the "Default Label *" textbox [755] has value "Size", the validation may not be recognizing it (stale validation state), or it needs re-entry to clear the error. The best next step is to refocus and explicitly fill the "Default Label *" field again to ensure it is populated and triggers validation, after which we can save. Therefore, I will fill the Default Label field [755] with "Size" to resolve the validation error before re-saving in subsequent steps.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened Stores > Attributes > Product and navigated to the Size attribute.
- Added a new swatch row for the size value “XXXL” and filled:
  - Admin “Swatch” textbox [1589]: “XXXL”
  - Default Store View “Swatch” textbox [1593]: “XXXL”
- Attempted to save; received validation error “The value of Admin scope can't be empty.”
- Re-entered the required “Default Label *” field [755] with “Size.”

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path: the Size attribute must include “XXXL” before adding the Green/XXXL configuration to the product.
- A validation message is present: “The value of Admin scope can't be empty.” This indicates at least one required Admin-scope field in the attribute form is considered empty until a successful save.
- Relevant interactive elements and state:
  - Textbox “Default Label *” [755]: value “Size”, required, focused.
  - Manage Swatch (Values of Your Attribute) group [816]:
    - New Admin “Swatch” textbox [1589]: “XXXL”, enabled/visible.
    - New Default Store View “Swatch” textbox [1593]: “XXXL”, enabled/visible.
    - “Add Swatch” button [1235]: enabled/visible.
  - Save controls:
    - “Save Attribute” button [734]: enabled/visible.
    - “Save and Continue Edit” button [732]: enabled/visible.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
1) Click “Save Attribute” [734].
2) If the same validation error reappears, check the Manage Swatch table [816] for any empty “Swatch” fields; ensure the new row fields [1589] and [1593] read “XXXL”, then click “Save Attribute” [734] again.
