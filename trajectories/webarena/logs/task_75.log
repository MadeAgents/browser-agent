The user wants the optimal order to visit three Boston-area locations starting at MIT to minimize total travel time. On OpenStreetMap, I should compare total travel times for the two possible sequences starting at MIT: (1) MIT -> Harvard -> Boston Logan International Airport and (2) MIT -> Boston Logan International Airport -> Harvard. The current page shows the OpenStreetMap main page with a search bar and a "Find directions between two points" control (the two-arrow icon) labeled as a link [167]. Based on the task tips, using the dedicated directions tool is the best next step, because it will provide travel times between locations. I will first open the directions interface by clicking the "Find directions between two points" link. Then I can enter the start and destination and press the "press" button to get travel times, and repeat for the other pair to sum totals. The current map is centered around Hong Kong, but the directions pane should allow me to search destinations regardless of current map center. Therefore, the immediate next action is to click the directions link [167] to open the routing panel.

Goal: Determine the optimal order to visit ['Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'Harvard University', 'Boston Logan International Airport'] starting at MIT to minimize total travel time using OpenStreetMap.

Current state: The OpenStreetMap directions panel is open. Mode is Car (OSRM).

The "To" field [199] contains "Harvard University" and is focused. No route result or travel time appears yet in the accessibility tree, indicating the route hasn’t been computed.

Plan: Trigger route calculation for MIT → Harvard by submitting the current inputs. On OSM, pressing Enter while focused in the "To" field typically calculates the route. After we get the travel time, we will record it, then compute times for the other necessary legs to compare total times for the two sequences. Since only one action is allowed, the immediate next step is to press Enter in the "To" field.

The user wants the optimal order to travel through three locations starting at MIT to minimize total travel time. To determine this, I need to compare the total driving times for the two possible sequences that start at MIT: (1) MIT → Harvard → Boston Logan International Airport and (2) MIT → Boston Logan International Airport → Harvard. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open, mode set to Car (OSRM). The "From" field currently shows a Harvard-area address (Albert H. Gordon Road, Allston...), and the "To" field is "Boston Logan International Airport". The results panel still shows the previous route time (0:09) which corresponds to the earlier Harvard → MIT route, indicating the new Harvard → Logan route hasn't been calculated yet. The next step is to trigger route calculation by submitting the current "To" field (press Enter). After that computes, I will read the travel time for Harvard → Logan. Then I will compute MIT → Harvard and MIT → Logan, Logan → Harvard in subsequent steps to compare totals and report the optimal sequence. Since only one action is allowed per step, I will now press Enter in the "To" field to calculate Harvard → Boston Logan International Airport.

Next steps to compare with Sequence B:
- Compute MIT → Logan time.
- Then compute Logan → Harvard time.
Plan:
1) Change "From" to "Massachusetts Institute of Technology" while keeping "To" as Logan, then press Enter to get MIT → Logan time.
2) After that, use "Reverse Directions" to switch to Logan → MIT, replace "To" with "Harvard University", press Enter to get Logan → Harvard time.
3) Compare total time for MIT → Logan → Harvard with 0:24 and report optimal sequence.

The user asks for the optimal route order to visit three Boston-area locations starting at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to minimize total travel time. With three locations and a fixed start, there are two sequences to compare:
- Sequence A: MIT → Harvard University → Boston Logan International Airport
- Sequence B: MIT → Boston Logan International Airport → Harvard University

We are using the OpenStreetMap directions tool (Car, OSRM). From prior steps, the interface shows:
- From [194]: “Massachusetts Institute of Technology”
- To [199]: “Logan International Airport, 1, Harborside Drive, … 02128, United States”
The currently displayed route in the results panel still corresponds to the earlier Harvard → Logan calculation (Distance 13km, Time 0:16), because after we changed the From field to MIT, we did not yet trigger recalculation. To update the route to MIT → Logan, we need to submit the current inputs. Pressing Enter while focused on a directions field triggers the calculation. Using press on the “To” field [199] focuses it and sends Enter, which should compute the MIT → Logan leg. After we have that time, we can proceed to compute Logan → Harvard by reversing and changing the destination to “Harvard University”, and finally compare total times to decide the optimal order.

Next step: Trigger route calculation for MIT → Logan by pressing Enter in the To field.

The goal is to determine the optimal visiting order for three locations starting at MIT by minimizing total travel time. To do this on OpenStreetMap, I need to compute total driving times for the two possible sequences starting at MIT:

- Current displayed route: Logan → MIT, time 0:14 (from previous reverse action), but we need Logan → Harvard.

Plan: Replace the "To" field with “Harvard University” to set up Logan → Harvard, then submit to compute the route. Because only one action is allowed per step, I will first fill the "To" textbox with “Harvard University”; in the next step, I will press Enter to calculate the route and read the travel time to finalize Sequence B’s total.

✅ Current Progress:
- Using OpenStreetMap Directions (Car mode via OSRM).
- Legs measured:
  - Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) → Harvard University: 0:08
  - Harvard University → Boston Logan International Airport: 0:16
  - MIT → Boston Logan International Airport: 0:15
- Inputs are now set for the remaining leg (Logan → Harvard). The results panel still shows the previous route’s result (9.1 km, 0:14), indicating the new route has not been recalculated yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path for achieving the goal (routing tool open and in correct mode).
- Relevant interactive elements and states:
  - [194] textbox “From” — value: “1, Harborside Drive, East Boston, Boston, … 02128, United States” (Logan); visible/enabled.
  - [199] textbox “To” — value: “Harvard University”; focused, visible/enabled.
  - [200] button “Reverse Directions” — visible/enabled.
  - [173] radio “Car” — checked.
  - [182] combobox “Directions services” — value: OSRM.
  - Results panel [495]/[497]/[498] — Distance: 9.1 km, Time: 0:14 (still reflecting a previous calculation).
- To finish, the Logan → Harvard leg time must be calculated to complete Sequence B (MIT → Logan → Harvard = 0:15 + [pending]) and compare against Sequence A (MIT → Harvard → Logan = 0:24).

Objective: Find the optimal order to visit ['Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'Harvard University', 'Boston Logan International Airport'] starting at MIT by minimizing total car travel time using OpenStreetMap.

Approach: Compare total times for the two sequences starting at MIT:
- Sequence A: MIT → Harvard → Boston Logan International Airport
- Sequence B: MIT → Boston Logan International Airport → Harvard

Progress so far:
- MIT → Harvard computed earlier: 0:08
- Harvard → Logan computed earlier: 0:16 → Sequence A total = 0:24
- MIT → Logan computed earlier: 0:15
- Now need Logan → Harvard to complete Sequence B.

Current page state:
- Directions panel is open (Car, OSRM).
- From [194]: “1, Harborside Drive, East Boston, Boston, … 02128, United States” (Logan).
- To [199]: “Harvard University” (focused).
- The results panel still shows a previous route (9.1km, 0:14), which corresponds to Logan → MIT, meaning the new destination (Harvard) hasn't been applied yet.

Next action: Trigger recalculation for Logan → Harvard by pressing Enter while focused in the “To” field.

The user asks for the optimal visiting order of three Boston-area locations starting at MIT to minimize total travel time. On the OpenStreetMap Directions panel (Car, OSRM), I computed the times for each necessary leg to compare the two possible sequences starting at MIT:
- MIT → Harvard = 0:08 (computed earlier on the page)
- Harvard → Logan = 0:16 (computed after setting From near Harvard and To = Boston Logan International Airport)
So Sequence A (MIT → Harvard → Logan) totals 0:24.

For Sequence B, I computed:
- MIT → Logan = 0:15 (after setting From = MIT, To = Logan and submitting)
- Logan → Harvard = 0:15 (by reversing to From = Logan, then setting To = Harvard and submitting; the page currently shows Distance 13km, Time 0:15)
Sequence B (MIT → Logan → Harvard) totals 0:30.

Comparing totals, Sequence A (MIT → Harvard → Logan) is shorter (0:24 vs 0:30). I will report this optimal order with the total and leg times, keeping the response concise and using the same time format as the site (“0:MM”).
