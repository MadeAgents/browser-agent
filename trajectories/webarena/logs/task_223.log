✅ Current Progress: Opened the OpenStreetMap Directions panel with driving mode selected. The destination (“To”) is set to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), and the map is centered on CMU.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page and panel are appropriate for calculating driving time to the nearest McDonald’s. Relevant interactive elements:
- Transport mode: radio “Car” [173] — checked (correct for driving time).
- Directions service: combobox “Directions services” [182] — value “OSRM” (active/visible).
- Textbox “From” [194] — empty (needs a start location).
- Textbox “To” [199] — filled with “Carnegie Mellon University, Hamerschlag Drive, …” (currently set as destination).
- Button “Reverse Directions” [200] — visible/enabled; can swap CMU into the “From” field.
- Button “Close” [187] — visible; closes the routing panel (not needed now).

The configuration is close but inverted relative to the goal (we need CMU as the start and “McDonald’s” as the destination). Once “From” is CMU and “To” is “McDonald’s” (nearest), the route and driving time can be computed on this page.

  - Reverse Directions button [200] — visible (not needed).
  - Results table [522] shows “Distance: 706km. Time: 8:30” — indicates an off-target destination.
- Deviation: The computed destination is far away and not the nearest McDonald’s to CMU.

- Replace the destination with a local query and recompute:
  1) Type “McDonald’s Pittsburgh, PA” into the To field [199].
  2) Press Enter on the To field [199] to recalculate the route to a nearby location.

The user wants the driving time from CMU to the nearest McDonald’s. The current OpenStreetMap directions show a route from CMU (“Walking to the Sky…” is in the From field) to a McDonald’s in Hickory, NC, which is clearly not the nearest. I need to correct the destination to a nearby McDonald’s in Pittsburgh. The To field [199] is focused and currently holds the Hickory, NC address. A good way to target the likely nearest one is to specify the McDonald’s on Forbes Avenue in Pittsburgh (near CMU/Oakland), which is typically the closest. I will replace the To field with “McDonald’s, Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA” and then in the following step press Enter to calculate the route. For now, I’ll perform the fill action.

✅ Current Progress:
- OpenStreetMap Directions panel is open with driving mode (Car) selected.
- “From” field [194] is set to a CMU landmark (“Walking to the Sky, Forbes Avenue, …”).
- Destination has been updated to a local query: “McDonald's, Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA” in the “To” field [199], but the route has not been recalculated yet (previous long-distance result still showing).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path (routing view for driving directions).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Car mode radio [173]: checked=true (correct).
  - Directions service combobox [182]: value=OSRM (suitable).
  - From textbox [194]: filled with CMU location; visible and enabled.
  - To textbox [199]: value="McDonald's, Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA"; focused, visible, enabled.
  - Reverse Directions button [200]: visible (not needed now).
  - Directions summary table [522] currently shows Distance 706km, Time 8:30, indicating the route has not yet updated to the new local destination and remains incorrect.
- Deviation: Results still reflect an unrelated distant McDonald’s; recalculation to the updated local destination is pending.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Recalculate the route to the updated local destination:
  1) Press Enter in the “To” textbox [199] to trigger route calculation.
  2) Verify the Directions summary [522] updates to a local distance/time (should be a few minutes, not hundreds of km). If it doesn’t update, re-enter “McDonald’s Pittsburgh, PA” in [199] and press Enter again.

The user wants the driving time from CMU to the nearest McDonald's. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with Car mode selected and the "From" field set to a CMU landmark ("Walking to the Sky…"). I previously updated the "To" field to "McDonald's, Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA", which should correspond to a nearby McDonald's in Pittsburgh. However, the directions summary still shows a long route (706km, 8:30), indicating the route hasn't been recalculated yet. To update the route to the new destination, I should submit the "To" field by pressing Enter, which triggers OSRM to recompute the directions. After that, I can read the updated time to report back to the user.

The user asks for how long it takes to drive from CMU Pittsburgh to the nearest McDonald’s. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with Car mode selected and shows a computed route:
- From: “Walking to the Sky, Forbes Avenue, Squirrel Hill North, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States” (a CMU landmark, appropriate as the starting point)

The directions summary displays “Distance: 2.1km. Time: 0:03”. This is the exact driving time needed. Since the task is to report the driving time, I should now send this result to the user concisely. Including brief context (distance and destination) can help the answer stand alone, but the primary requested item is the time. I will send a succinct message with the time and optional distance/destination context.
