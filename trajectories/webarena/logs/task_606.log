The user wants me to find a subreddit (forum) focused on NYC and post their question "is car necessary". According to the task tips, I should use the "Forums" tab to locate the relevant forum, likely named f/nyc. On the current page (Postmill home), I see the top navigation with a "Forums" link (bid 42). The best next step is to click "Forums" to access the forum listing, where I can look for an NYC-focused forum, probably by using an alphabetical view. After finding the correct forum, I'll navigate into it and then use the Submit button within that forum to create a post, ensuring the Body contains the exact text and the URL field is empty. For now, I need to click "Forums" to proceed.

The task is to post the question "is car necessary" in an NYC-focused forum. I navigated to the NYC forum and opened the Create submission page. The Title and Body fields are already filled with the exact text "is car necessary", and the Forum combobox is set to "nyc". Per the posting guidelines, the URL field should be left empty, which it currently is. The next logical step is to submit the form by clicking the "Create submission" button to complete the posting.

The user's goal was to find a NYC-focused subreddit (forum) and post the question "is car necessary." I navigated to the Forums page, switched to the alphabetical listing, selected the specialized forum "nyc" (f/nyc), clicked Submit to open the Create submission form, and filled both Title and Body with the exact text "is car necessary" while leaving the URL field empty, as per the instructions. I then clicked "Create submission." The current page confirms the post is live in /f/nyc with the title and body both showing "is car necessary." Therefore, the task is complete. The best next step is to inform the user and provide the direct link to the post (and optionally the short URL).
