The user wants the page of the college(s) where The Chair was filmed in Pennsylvania, excluding Pittsburgh ones, on the OpenStreetMap. Since OpenStreetMap has a search bar and it's already focused (element [162]), the fastest way is to search for a likely college outside Pittsburgh known to be a filming location. A strong candidate is "Washington & Jefferson College" in Washington, PA. I will enter this into the search field first, then after seeing results I can click Go or the appropriate result. This adheres to the tip to use the search bar instead of scrolling.

✅ Current Progress: Entered the search query “Washington & Jefferson College” into the OpenStreetMap search field.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to the goal. The search textbox labeled “Search” (id [162]) is focused and filled with “Washington & Jefferson College.” The adjacent “Go” button (id [165]) is visible and appears clickable. Other nearby controls include “Find directions between two points” (link [167]) and “Query features” (link [454]), which are not directly needed for initiating the place search. The current map view is not centered on Pennsylvania, but executing the search via the “Go” button should navigate to the relevant place page.

The goal is to find the OpenStreetMap page(s) for the college(s) where "The Chair" was filmed in Pennsylvania, excluding Pittsburgh colleges. A known non-Pittsburgh filming location is Washington & Jefferson College (in Washington, PA). The search box [162] is already filled with “Washington & Jefferson College,” and the adjacent “Go” button [165] should initiate the search and bring up the relevant place page or search results.
