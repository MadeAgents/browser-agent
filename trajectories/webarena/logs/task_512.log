The goal is to add a toothpaste to the wish list. I am on the Oral Care category page, and I can see a product that is explicitly a toothpaste: “Rembrandt Intense Stain Whitening Toothpaste With Fluoride3 oz(3 Packs)” priced at $30.73. Within that product tile, there is an “Add to Wish List” button [1568], which is the exact action needed. The user is already logged in (“Welcome, Emma Lopez!”) and has an existing wish list with 5 items, so clicking this button should add the toothpaste and likely update the wish list count. To fulfill the task efficiently, I will click the “Add to Wish List” button for that toothpaste product.
