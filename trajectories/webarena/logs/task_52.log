The user's goal is to find the walking time from Carnegie Mellon University to the Starbucks on Craig Street using the current OpenStreetMap page. On the page, I see the standard OSM interface with the search box and a link labeled "Find directions between two points" (which corresponds to the two-arrows directions tool). The best approach is to open the directions panel first, which will present two input fields (From/To) and transport mode options (Car/Bicycle/Foot). Then I can enter "Carnegie Mellon University" as the starting point and "Starbucks Craig Street Pittsburgh PA" as the destination, select the "Foot" profile, and read the estimated time.

Following the benchmark tips, it's better to use the built-in directions button rather than manually searching and then switching to directions. So the next step is to click the "Find directions between two points" link to open the directions interface.

The user asks for the walking time from Carnegie Mellon University to the Starbucks on Craig Street. We’re already on the OpenStreetMap directions page with:
- Mode set to Foot (radio checked).
- From: Carnegie Mellon University (detailed address).
- To: Starbucks, 428 South Craig Street (detailed address).
- The live region shows “Loading...”, indicating the route is being computed.

To obtain the time, I should wait for the route results to appear under the Directions section. Since there’s no explicit wait action, I’ll perform a harmless action (hover over the Directions heading) to allow the page to update without triggering any re-routing or changing inputs. After this, the results (including walking time) should populate, and I can read them in the next step.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened OpenStreetMap’s Directions panel.
- Set travel mode to Foot (walking).
- Filled “From” with Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, PA).
- Filled “To” with Starbucks on South Craig Street (Pittsburgh, PA).
- Attempted to compute route, but received an error.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path (Directions panel is open and populated for walking).
- Current elements and states:
  - Radio “Foot” [179]: checked=true, visible/enabled.
  - Combobox “Directions services” [182]: value="OSRM", visible/enabled.
    - Options available: “GraphHopper” [184], “OSRM” [185] (selected), “Valhalla” [186].
  - Textbox “From” [194]: filled with Carnegie Mellon University address, visible/enabled.
  - Textbox “To” [199]: filled with “Starbucks, 428, South Craig Street, ... Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States”, focused, visible/enabled.
  - Heading “Directions” [476]: visible; below it, an error message states: “Couldn't find a route between those two places.”
  - Button “Reverse Directions” [200]: visible/enabled.
- Status: Blocked by routing error from the currently selected service (OSRM).

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Change routing engine to try a different service:
  1) Click the combobox “Directions services” [182], then select option “Valhalla” [186].
  2) If the route does not auto-recalculate, press Enter while focused in the “To” textbox [199] to trigger routing.

The user wants the walking time between Carnegie Mellon University and the Starbucks on Craig Street. We are on the OpenStreetMap directions page with:
- Mode set to Foot (radio [179] is checked).
- From: Carnegie Mellon University (textbox [194]) with a full Pittsburgh address.
- To: Starbucks, 428 South Craig Street (textbox [199]) with a full Pittsburgh address.

The page currently shows the error “Couldn't find a route between those two places,” which likely indicates the selected routing service (OSRM) failed to compute a walking route. There is a “Directions services” combobox [182] with options: GraphHopper [184], OSRM [185] (selected), and Valhalla [186]. Changing the routing engine to Valhalla often resolves such issues. Since only one action is allowed at a time, the best next step is to directly select “Valhalla” in the combobox using the select_option action. This should trigger a recalculation of the route and then we can read the walking time.
