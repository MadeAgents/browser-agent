The user wants the total duration for a two-part trip: first walking from "Univ of Pittsburgh" to "starbucks on Craig Street", then driving from that Starbucks to "Pittsburgh International Airport". On OpenStreetMap, I should use the built-in directions tool. The current page shows the main OpenStreetMap interface with a search box and a "Find directions between two points" link (the two arrows icon). According to the task tips, to find routes from point A to B, I should use this directions function rather than manually panning/scrolling. Clicking the "Find directions between two points" link should open a routing panel where I can enter the start and end points and choose the mode (walking first, then driving). So the next step is to click that link to open the directions interface.

We're on OpenStreetMap with the directions panel visible. The mode is currently set to Car. For the first leg we need to switch to Foot, then input start and destination in the "From" [194] and "To" [199] fields and compute the route. After getting the walking duration, we will switch mode to Car for the second leg and update the destinations accordingly. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best action is to switch the transport mode to Foot by clicking the "Foot" label [180].

✅ Current Progress: First-leg setup completed but routing failed. “From” is set to University of Pittsburgh [194], “To” is set to “Starbucks, 428 South Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA” [199], and Foot mode is selected [179]/[180]. The directions panel shows “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” No duration obtained yet. Second (driving) leg not started.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path (OpenStreetMap routing panel active).
- Mode selectors [172]:
  - Foot [179]/[180]: checked=true (correct for first leg), visible and enabled.

- Directions service [182] “OSRM”: visible, enabled, collapsed; alternative options available (GraphHopper [184], Valhalla [186]).
- Inputs:
  - From textbox [194]: filled with “University of Pittsburgh, 4200 Fifth Avenue…”; focused, enabled, visible.
  - To textbox [199]: filled with “Starbucks, 428 South Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213”; enabled, visible.
- Routing status: Error message under “Directions” [476]: “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” Page is relevant but currently blocked by routing failure.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Open the “Directions services” combobox [182] and select “Valhalla” [186] (or “GraphHopper” [184]) to change the routing provider.
- Press Enter in the “To” field [199] to recompute the walking route after changing the provider.

The current directions panel is set to Foot mode with “From” as University of Pittsburgh and “To” as Starbucks at 428 South Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213. However, the panel shows “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” This often happens due to the selected routing engine. The combobox “Directions services” is currently set to OSRM. To resolve the routing failure and obtain the walking duration, I should switch to a different routing provider, such as Valhalla, using the “Directions services” combobox [182], which lists Valhalla [186] and GraphHopper [184]. Selecting Valhalla is a good next step; it typically supports walking routing well. After switching, the route should recompute automatically or allow pressing Enter on the “To” field to compute. I will change the provider now.

Goal: Find the duration required to first walk from "University of Pittsburgh" to "Starbucks on Craig Street", then drive to "Pittsburgh International Airport".

Current state: The OpenStreetMap directions panel is open, mode is Foot (checked), From [194] is set to the full University of Pittsburgh address, To [199] is set to the Starbucks at 428 South Craig Street, and the directions service is set to Valhalla. The status shows "Loading...", indicating the walking route is being computed after switching provider.

Plan: Wait for the walking route to compute and display the duration. Since there's no explicit wait action, perform a benign action that doesn't interfere—focusing the "To" textbox—allowing the interface to update. Once the walking duration appears, I will switch mode to Car, set From as Starbucks and To as Pittsburgh International Airport, compute, then read the driving duration. Finally, I will report durations (individually and possibly total).

Next action: Focus the "To" field [199] to allow the page to finish updating and be ready to read the result or trigger recalculation if needed in a subsequent step.

The task is to find the duration for a two-leg trip: walk from University of Pittsburgh to Starbucks on Craig Street, then drive from that Starbucks to Pittsburgh International Airport. We are on the OpenStreetMap directions page with the routing panel open. Current state:
- Mode: Foot is selected (good for leg 1).
- From [194]: University of Pittsburgh full address is filled.
- To [199]: Starbucks, 428 South Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 is filled and focused.
- Directions services [182]: OSRM is selected.
- Status live region [479]: "Loading..." is visible, indicating route computation is in progress.

To ensure the walking route is calculated and the duration appears, a direct Enter on the To field often triggers/refetches the route. After switching providers earlier, it's sensible to explicitly re-submit. Only one action is allowed; pressing Enter on the To field is the most efficient to get the walking directions duration to display. Once the duration appears, the next steps will be to switch to Car, set From as Starbucks and To as Pittsburgh International Airport, then compute the driving duration.

We need the durations for two legs:
1) Walk from University of Pittsburgh to Starbucks on Craig Street
2) Drive from that Starbucks to Pittsburgh International Airport

We’re already on the OpenStreetMap Directions page with:
- Mode: Foot selected (correct for leg 1)
- From [194]: University of Pittsburgh (full address)
- To [199]: Starbucks, 428 South Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 (focused)
- Directions service combobox [182] currently set to OSRM
- The panel shows an error: “Couldn't find a route between those two places.”

Previously, I attempted multiple providers and presses, but the interface still shows the error. A common resolution is switching the routing provider. The combobox offers GraphHopper and Valhalla. Since we are on OSRM now and it failed, the best next single action is to switch the provider to Valhalla to try recalculating the walking route. If successful, the duration will appear; otherwise I can press Enter on the To field or try another provider next. Only one action is allowed now, so I will select Valhalla in the directions services combobox [182].

The user needs durations for a two-leg trip: walking from University of Pittsburgh to Starbucks on Craig Street, then driving from that Starbucks to Pittsburgh International Airport. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with:
- Mode: Foot (correct for the first leg)
- From: University of Pittsburgh (full address)
- To: Starbucks, 428 South Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213

However, there’s a red error message: “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” This often happens with a specific routing engine. Switching the “Directions services” provider is a common fix. The combobox [182] offers GraphHopper, OSRM, and Valhalla. Since GraphHopper is failing, the next best step is to switch to a different provider (OSRM) to trigger recalculation of the walking route. Once the walking duration is obtained, I will proceed to switch to Car and compute the driving leg to Pittsburgh International Airport.

The user needs durations for a two-leg trip: walking from University of Pittsburgh to Starbucks on Craig Street, then driving from that Starbucks to Pittsburgh International Airport. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with:
- Mode: Foot (correct for the first leg)
- From: University of Pittsburgh (full address)
- To: Starbucks, 428 South Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213
- Directions service: GraphHopper

However, there’s a red error message: “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” This often happens with a specific routing engine.

The user wants the total duration for a two-leg trip: first walking from the University of Pittsburgh to the Starbucks on Craig Street, then driving from that Starbucks to Pittsburgh International Airport. I’m already on the OpenStreetMap Directions page with the routing panel open. The Foot mode is selected, which is correct for the first leg. The From field contains the full University of Pittsburgh address, and the To field contains “Starbucks, 428, South Craig Street, … 15213,” which looks correct. The directions service is currently set to OSRM, and the live region shows “Loading…”, meaning the walking route calculation is in progress. Since only one action is permitted and there’s no explicit waiting function, the best next step is to explicitly trigger/retrigger the calculation by pressing Enter in the “To” field. This commonly ensures the routing engine computes and displays the duration. Once the walking duration appears, I will switch to Car and set the second leg to Pittsburgh International Airport.

Objective: Determine the duration for a two-leg trip using OpenStreetMap routing:
1) Walk from University of Pittsburgh to Starbucks on Craig Street.
2) Drive from that Starbucks to Pittsburgh International Airport.

Current page state:
- Directions panel open on OpenStreetMap.
- Mode: Foot is selected (correct for leg 1).
- Directions services combobox: OSRM.
- From [194]: "University of Pittsburgh, 4200, Fifth Avenue, West Oakland, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15260, United States".
- To [199]: "Starbucks, 428, South Craig Street, North Oakland, Bellefield, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15213, United States".
- Error message: "Couldn't find a route between those two places."

Analysis:
- Despite correct entries and trying multiple providers earlier, the UI still shows the error for the walking route.
- A common workaround is to slightly adjust the start/end inputs to re-trigger geocoding to a snap-friendly point. Modifying the "From" entry to a simpler, less specific label ("Univ of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA") may change the snap point and allow routing.
- Only one action allowed now, so I will re-enter the From field with a simpler form to prompt re-geocoding; I can then press Enter in the next step to compute.

Next step:
- Fill the "From" field [194] with "Univ of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA" to attempt to resolve the routing error for the walking leg.
