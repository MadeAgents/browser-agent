The user wants me to star the top four most starred repositories in GitLab. On the Projects dashboard, I see tabs including Yours, Starred, Explore, Topics, and within the current section there is a "Most stars" button [277]. Sorting by "Most stars" will surface the repositories with the highest star counts at the top, allowing me to then star the top four. Before starring, I should first sort the list accordingly.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the “Most stars” sort dropdown. No repositories have been starred yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the Projects dashboard with tabs for Yours, Starred, Explore, and Topics. To achieve “top four most starred in GitLab,” the Explore tab should be used to see all projects, not just personal ones. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link “Explore” [268] — visible and enabled (needed to view global projects).
- Button “Most stars” [277] — currently focused and expanded=True (sort menu is open).
- Link “Most stars” [291] — visible within the open sort menu (selecting this applies the correct sort).
- Searchbox “Filter by name” [273] — empty, not required right now.
- Filters “All” [311] and “Personal” [313] — present; current selection not explicitly indicated.

The agent has not yet navigated to Explore nor selected projects to star; current page likely shows personal projects, which is off the critical path for finding the globally most-starred repositories.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link “Explore” [268] to switch to the global project list.
- In the Explore list, open the sort control “Most stars” button [277] (if not already open) and click “Most stars” [291] to sort globally by star count. Then locate the star controls in the top four project rows and star them.

The goal is to star the top four most starred repositories across the whole GitLab instance. The current page is the Projects dashboard showing personal projects (“Yours 50”), which won’t list global top-starred repos. To access globally popular projects, I should navigate to the Explore section. The “Explore” link is visible with bid 268 in the header section under the Projects tab list. Clicking it will take me to the Explore Projects page where I can switch to the “Most stars” view and proceed to star the top four projects.

🔍 Current State Analysis: You are on “Projects · Explore · GitLab,” which is on the critical path for finding globally most-starred repositories. The list appears not sorted by star count (e.g., a project with 267 stars appears above one with 1.5k), so switching to the “Most stars” view is needed before starring the top four. Relevant interactive elements:
- Tab/link “Most stars” [294] — visible; use to sort the Explore list by star count.
- Button “Most stars” [258] — visible; also indicates the sorting option.
- Project links in the list (to open individual project pages where the Star/Unstar control is available):
  - “Umano: News Read To You / AndroidSlidingUpPanel” [333] — visible.
  - “Meta / create-react-app” [369] — visible; star count link [392] shows “1.5k”.

Objective: Star the top four most starred repositories. From earlier steps, "OpenAPI Tools / openapi-generator" is already starred (Unstar visible) and the current page "Keycloak / keycloak" also shows "Unstar", meaning it is starred. So 2/4 completed. The remaining likely top repositories seen on Explore > Most stars were "Meta / create-react-app" and "node-http-proxy". To efficiently navigate to "create-react-app", the Task Tips specify that the global search bar is not working and recommend using the search URL pattern. Therefore, instead of navigating back to Explore and sorting again, I will use the direct search URL to find "create-react-app" next, then star it on its project page.

Plan:
1) Use the GitLab search URL to find "create-react-app".
2) From results, open its project page and star it.
3) Repeat for "node-http-proxy".

Next action: Navigate to the search URL for "create-react-app".

The goal is to star the top four most starred repositories across GitLab. From prior steps:
- OpenAPI Tools / openapi-generator: already starred (Unstar visible).

That accounts for three of the top four. The remaining top repository identified on Explore > Most stars was “node-http-proxy” (listed under the http-party group).
