The user wants me to re-post the image from a specific post (“Wife’s costume”) into the funny forum and include the note “from /f/pics”. According to the task tips, to view a post’s details and access its image, I should click the “comments” link associated with the post rather than the title. On the current /f/pics page, I can see the article titled “My wife’s toy costume for 2022” with a “137 comments” link (bid 543). The next step is to open the post detail by clicking that comments link so I can get the image or its URL to use in the new submission to /f/funny.

The user wants me to re-post the image from this specific post to the funny forum and add the note “from /f/pics”. To create a proper submission, I’ll likely need the image URL to include in the Body field (as per the task tips: put all content including URLs in the Body field, leave URL field empty). On the current post page, I can see the image under the title as a clickable link (Accessibility tree shows [142] link with [143] image). The best next step is to click that image link to open or reveal its direct URL. Once I have the image URL, I can proceed to the submission form and create a post in /f/funny with the image URL and the note. Therefore, I will click the image link now.

Objective: Re-post the "Wife's costume" image from the current page into the funny forum and include the note "from /f/pics". To do this properly per Task Tips, I should put all content (including the image URL) into the Body field and leave the URL field empty. I also need to switch the target forum from pics to funny.

Current state: I’m on the Create submission page for /f/pics, with empty Title and Body. I still need the image URL and ideally the original title. I previously viewed the post detail where the image is present. The most efficient next step is to go back to the post page to retrieve the image URL (by opening the image to its direct URL and copying it) and confirm the exact title. Then I can return to the submission form (or navigate to /submit/funny) and paste the URL into the Body along with the note.

The task is to re-post the image from this post into the funny forum and include the note "from /f/pics". To create a new submission, I should open the submission form via the "Submit" link in the header, select the target forum ("funny"), and fill in Title and Body (per task tips: put all content including URLs in the Body field, leave URL field empty). I previously navigated away from the submission form and returned to the post. The next step is to access the submission form again so I can set the forum and enter the required content.

The goal is to re-post the image of “Wife’s costume” to the funny forum and include the note “from /f/pics”. Per the site’s task tips, when creating a post, all content including URLs must go into the Body field and the URL field should be left empty. To properly re-post, I need the direct image URL from the original post. I’m currently on the Create submission page for the “pics” forum, but the image URL isn’t present here. From the earlier steps, I had viewed the post and the image page, then navigated back to submission. The most effective next step is to return to the post detail page so I can capture the image URL, then come back to the submission form to set the forum to “funny” and fill Title and Body (including the image URL and the note “from /f/pics”). Therefore, I should go back to the previous page where the post and image link are available.

The user’s goal is to re-post the image from this post into the funny forum and include the note “from /f/pics.” To achieve that, I need the direct image URL and then use the submission form to create a new post in the funny forum. On this post page, the image is a clickable link (node [142]) which should navigate to the direct image resource. Once I’m on the image page, I can read the tab URL (the environment will show it) and then return to the submission form to create a new post targeting “funny,” using the original title (“My wife’s toy costume for 2022”) and placing the image URL along with the exact note “from /f/pics” in the Body field (leaving the URL field empty per the tips).

The goal is to create a submission in the funny forum that re-posts the image and includes the note “from /f/pics.” I’m on the Create submission page with the Forum currently set to “pics.” I need to:
- Fill the Title exactly as requested (“Wife's costume”).
- Put the image URL and the note “from /f/pics” into the Body field.
- Change the Forum combobox from “pics” to “funny.”
- Submit.

Since only one action is allowed per step, I’ll start by filling the required Title field to clear the “This field is required” state. The title textbox corresponds to bid 138.

Objective: Re-post the image of "Wife's costume" to the funny forum and include the note "from /f/pics". On the Create submission page, the Title is already filled with "Wife's costume". Per Task Tips, I must put all content including URLs in the Body field and leave the URL field empty. I also need to change the Forum from "pics" to "funny" before submitting.

Current UI elements:
- Body field is [143] textbox 'Body'.
- Forum combobox shows 'pics' and will need to be changed later.
- Create submission button is available.

Plan: First, fill the Body with the direct image URL I saved and the note "from /f/pics" on the next line. Then I’ll change the Forum to "funny" and submit. Since only one action is allowed per step, I’ll fill the Body now.

The forum selector appears as a combobox with an inner textbox currently showing “pics” (bid 385).
