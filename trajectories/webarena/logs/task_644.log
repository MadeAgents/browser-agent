The user asked to post a notice in the gaming forum. From the current page, I can confirm the submission is already created and live: the article heading matches “virtual meetup for Tears of Kingdom enthusiasts on Dec 15th,” it shows “Submitted by MarvelsGrantMan136 … in gaming,” and the body text matches exactly. Since the post exists and the goal is fulfilled, the best next step is to inform the user of successful completion and provide the direct link to the post, including the short URL visible in the sidebar. I will send a concise confirmation message with the forum, title, body, and URLs.
