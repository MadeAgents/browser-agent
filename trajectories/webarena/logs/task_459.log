The user wants the price reduced by 10% for the currently open product. I can see the Price field showing 69.00. Per the rules, any calculation must use the calculate() function. Therefore, I should first compute the new price as 69.00 * 0.9. After getting the result, I will update the Price input and then save, but only one action is allowed per step, so I will start with the calculation.

✅ Current Progress:
- Calculated the new price as 62.10 (10% reduction from 69.00). No changes applied to the product yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is the Magento Admin product edit view for “Ajax Full-Zip Sweatshirt -XL-Red,” which is directly on the critical path to reducing the product price.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Textbox “[global] Price * $” (id/index [985]) with current value “69.00” and label “[global] Price”. This is the field to update.
  - Button “Save” (id/index [876]) available for committing changes.
  - Button “Advanced Pricing” (id/index [990]) present but not required for changing the base price.
  - Scope selector “All Store Views” (button [858]). Price is marked as “[global]”, indicating base price update applies globally.

The goal is to reduce the product price by 10%. I already computed the new price using the required calculate() function: 69.00 * 0.9 = 62.10. Now I need to apply this value to the product’s Price field on the current Magento Admin product edit page. The Accessibility Tree shows the Price input as the textbox labeled “[global] Price * $” with bid 985 and current value “69.00.” The next step is to update this field to “62.10.” After that, I will save in a subsequent step.
