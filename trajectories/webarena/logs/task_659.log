The user wants me to create an issue in the "empathy-prompts" repository. I’m currently on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I can see the project "Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts" with an accessible link element [435]. The first step is to navigate into that project's page. From there, I’ll need to go to the Issues section, create a new issue, set the title to "Integrating LLMs for better prompts", assign it to Roshanjossey, and set the due date to the beginning of Q2 2033 (which is April 1, 2033). Given only one action per step, the best immediate action is to click the "Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts" project link [435] to open the repository page where I can access Issues and proceed with creation and assignment.

The user’s goal is to create an issue titled "Integrating LLMs for better prompts", assign it to Roshanjossey, and set the due date to the beginning of Q2 2033 (April 1, 2033). On the “New Issue” page, the title is already filled correctly and the assignee appears set to "Roshan Jossy" (the button label shows the name, indicating selection). The remaining step is to set the due date. The accessibility tree shows the due date input as a textbox labeled "Select due date" with bid [853]. To set the date, the next step is to click this field to open the date picker (or focus the input) so I can choose April 1, 2033.

We are on the "New Issue" page for the empathy-prompts repository, with the Title already set correctly and the Assignee set to "Roshan Jossy". The Due date field is focused, and a date picker is open showing December 2025. The user wants the due date set to the beginning of Q2 2033, which is April 1, 2033.

To reach April 2033 efficiently using the date picker, I should first change the year to 2033. The accessibility tree shows a year combobox [1011] with options including 2033 [1030]. Using select_option on the year combobox should update the calendar year. After that, in subsequent steps, I can set the month to April and select day 1, then create the issue.

Therefore, the best next single action is to change the year to 2033 using the year combobox.
