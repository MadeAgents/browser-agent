The user asked what customers say about the brush from Sephora. I need to find a Sephora brush product page and read its reviews. The homepage shows a search bar, which is the fastest way to locate a specific product rather than navigating categories. The search field is a combobox labeled "Search" with bid 273, and the "Search" button is currently disabled; entering text should enable it or allow submitting via Enter. My next step is to type a relevant query like "sephora brush" into the search field to bring up matching products. After that, I can proceed to submit the search and navigate to a product page with reviews. For now, I will perform the fill action.

The user asks what customers say about a brush from Sephora. To provide this, I should open a Sephora brush product page and read its customer reviews to summarize sentiments. I’m already on the search results page for “sephora brush.” Among the results, I see two relevant brush products: “Sephora Collection Skin Perfecting Brush Set” and “SEPHORA COLLECTION PRO Featherweight Powder Brush #91.” The grid view doesn’t display reviews directly, so I need to click into a specific product detail page where a Reviews tab/section will be available. The most on-point single brush item is “SEPHORA COLLECTION PRO Featherweight Powder Brush #91,” which likely has a review section. I will click that product link to access its details and find customer reviews to summarize.
