- Click button “Next” [701] to move to the next review and look for negative feedback.

The user wants to know what customers dislike about the Electra Bra Top. I filtered the Reviews grid to this product and opened one review that was clearly negative about sizing (“Not exactly true to size”). I’m currently on another review page showing a positive comment (“Snug fit without being too tight”), so to identify other negative aspects I should navigate through the remaining reviews for this product. The page has navigation buttons: Previous [695], Save and Previous [697], Save and Next [699], and Next [701]. My last attempt to click [697] resulted in a timeout and appears to have targeted a mislabeled element (“id='next'” with bid 697).

The user wants to know what customers dislike about the Electra Bra Top. I filtered the Reviews grid to this product and opened one review that was clearly negative about sizing (“Not exactly true to size”). I’m currently on another review page showing a positive comment (“Snug fit without being too tight”), so to identify other negative aspects I should navigate through the remaining reviews for this product. The page has navigation buttons: Previous [695], Save and Previous [697], Save and Next [699], and Next [701]. My last attempt to click [697] resulted in a timeout and appears to have targeted a mislabeled element (“id='next'” with bid 697). To avoid repeating the problematic action, I will click the explicit “Next” button [701] to move to the next review and look for additional negative feedback.

The goal is to determine what customers dislike about the Electra Bra Top by reviewing customer feedback. I’m currently on the Edit Review page for review ID 318, which is a positive review (mentions comfort and dryness). Attempting to navigate via the “Next” button timed out, so repeating that action is likely ineffective. The most reliable way to see all reviews for this product is to return to the filtered Reviews grid and open entries with negative sentiments (e.g., the earlier “Not exactly true to size” review and any others). Therefore, I will click “Back” to go back to the list where I can select other reviews to extract dislikes.

The user wants a summary of what customers dislike about the Electra Bra Top. I’m on the Reviews page filtered to Product = “Electra Bra Top,” showing 4 reviews. From the visible titles/snippets:
- ID 316: Title “Not exactly true to size” with snippet “Not exactly true to size but still very comfor...” — this indicates a negative aspect about sizing/fit accuracy.
- The other three reviews are positive (“Snug fit without being too tight,” “bra stays comfy and dry,” “One of my favorites b/c no chafing!”), which do not express dislikes.
Therefore, the key disliked aspect is that the product is not exactly true to size. I will send a concise answer to the user, quoting the exact wording from the review title to match source terminology.
