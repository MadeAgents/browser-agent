The user asks for the zip code of Chatham University. According to the Task Tips, when a location name could be ambiguous, we should look up the one in Pittsburgh, PA, and we must use the current OpenStreetMap site. The OpenStreetMap page is open with the search textbox [162] focused and a Go button [165] next to it. The best next step is to enter "Chatham University" into the search field and click Go to retrieve results. From there, I can select the Pittsburgh result and read the address to extract the zip code. So the immediate action is to fill the search field with "Chatham University".

The task is to find the ZIP code of Chatham University using the current OpenStreetMap page. The search field [162] is already populated with "Chatham University" and focused, as shown in the accessibility tree and progress summary. The next step is to execute the search by clicking the adjacent "Go" button [165]. This should bring up search results, where I can then select the Chatham University entry in Pittsburgh, PA, and read the full address (including ZIP) from its details. The welcome panel is visible but does not block the search controls, so clicking "Go" is the correct immediate action.

The user asks for the ZIP code of Chatham University. On the current OpenStreetMap search results panel, there are two entries. The first result, labeled "University," shows "Chatham University, Chapel Hill Road, Squirrel Hill North, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15232, United States," which contains the ZIP code 15232 for the main campus in Pittsburgh. The second result is a "University Building" with a different ZIP (15208), likely a separate facility. Since the question refers to Chatham University generally and per the Task Tips we should focus on the Pittsburgh location, the appropriate ZIP code is 15232. I can answer directly based on this visible result without needing to click further.
