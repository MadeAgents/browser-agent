The user wants to display the list of issues in the umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel repository that have labels related to BUG. I'm currently on the GitLab dashboard Projects page. Per the provided tips, the global search bar is not working; instead, I should use the special search URL with only the project name. Therefore, the next logical step is to navigate to the search URL with search=AndroidSlidingUpPanel to locate the repository. Once on the search results, I will need to click into the umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel project, go to the Issues tab, and then apply a label filter for "bug" or similar. For now, I will initiate the search navigation.

- link [322] “Umano: News Read To You / AndroidSlidingUpPanel” — visible, enabled; leads to the project page where repository-specific issues and label filters are available.

The task is to display the list of issues in the umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel repository with labels related to BUG. I'm currently on the GitLab search results page for "AndroidSlidingUpPanel." The left navigation shows categories (Projects, Issues, etc.), and in the results list, I see the specific project "Umano: News Read To You / AndroidSlidingUpPanel" with a link element [322].

Once inside the project, I can navigate to the Issues tab and apply label filters (e.g., "bug"). Therefore, the next step is to click the project link [322] to open the repository page.

The user wants to show issues in the umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel repo that have bug-related labels. I’m already on the project’s Issues page with the “Open 267” tab selected, showing the issue list and the filter controls. To filter by label, I should use the “Search or filter results...” input (bid 555). GitLab supports tokenized filters in this field, such as label filters. Typing a label filter like “label: ~bug” should constrain the list to issues tagged with the “bug” label (or related). After entering the filter, I will need to run the search (via the Search button), but since only one action is allowed per step, I will first fill the search/filter input with the label filter. The next step will be to click the Search button.

I'm already on the project's Issues page with the "Open" tab selected and the filter textbox focused.

The goal is to display the list of issues with labels related to BUG within the umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel project. I'm already on the project's Issues page with the "Open" tab selected and the filter textbox focused. The helper dropdown for tokenized filters is visible, showing options like Assignee, Author, Confidential, Label, etc. To properly filter by label, I should use the Label token from this dropdown instead of typing free-form text, which previously didn't apply correctly. The best next step is to click the "Label" menu item to add a label filter token, which should then allow me to choose the specific bug-related label (likely "bug") from a subsequent suggestions list.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel project’s Issues page (Open tab selected).
- Activated the filter input and selected the “Label” filter token, bringing up the operator choices for the label filter.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is the correct Issues list for the target repository and is on the critical path to filtering by bug-related labels.
- Relevant interactive elements for progressing:
  - textbox [1275] “Search” — focused and visible; filter entry point.
  - menuitem [1281] “= is” — visible; selects inclusion operator for the Label filter.
  - menuitem [1287] “!= is not” — visible; selects exclusion operator for the Label filter.
  - button [557] “Search” — enabled; applies the current filters.
  - button [1292] “Clear” — enabled; clears current filter tokens.
  - tab [507] “Open 267” — selected; tabs [511] “Closed 558” and [515] “All 825” available if scope needs adjusting.
- No errors detected; the next action is to finalize the label filter (choose operator, then select the desired bug-related label) and apply it.

The user wants to display issues with bug-related labels in the umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel project. I’m already on the project’s Issues page with the Open tab selected. I previously activated the filter input and chose the “Label” token. The UI now shows the operator options for the label filter: “= is” and “!= is not.” To include issues with a specific label, I should select “= is,” which will then present the list of label values (e.g., “bug”). After selecting the operator, I can pick the “bug” label and apply the filter. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best action is to click the “= is” operator to proceed to label selection.

  - Filter token area [534]: shows “Label = ~BUG” with a removable token.
    - Button [1343] “Close” — enabled; would remove the BUG label filter.
    - Textbox [1345] “Search” — focused; can add more filters.
