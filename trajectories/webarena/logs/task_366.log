The user wants the walking distance between the closest CVS and UPMC Shadyside. On OpenStreetMap, the best approach is:
1) Search for UPMC Shadyside in Pittsburgh, PA to center the map on the correct area.
2) Use the directions tool to set endpoints. To ensure we use the nearest CVS, we can set the destination as UPMC Shadyside and the origin as “CVS” and then choose the specific CVS result that is closest. The directions panel often allows refining the chosen POIs.
Currently, the page is centered on Singapore; the search field is focused. The immediate next step is to search for “UPMC Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA” using the Go button afterward. I will first fill the search box with the target hospital name.

- [526]/[528]/[529] route summary — shows Distance '2368km' and Time '26:58', confirming the origin is wrong.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Replace the origin with a local CVS: Type “CVS Pharmacy, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA” into the “From” textbox [194] and press Enter to resolve to a nearby CVS.
- Switch to walking mode: Click the “Foot” radio button [179] to compute walking distance.

✅ Current Progress:
- OpenStreetMap Directions panel is open.
- “To” is correctly set to UPMC Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA ([199]).
- “From” has been updated to “CVS Pharmacy, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA” ([194]) but the route has not been recalculated yet.
- Routing mode is still set to Car.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page is on the critical path for measuring walking distance between CVS and UPMC Shadyside.
- Relevant elements and states:
  - [194] textbox “From” — value='CVS Pharmacy, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA', focused; editable.
  - [199] textbox “To” — value='UPMC Shadyside, 5230, Centre Avenue, …, 15232, United States'; editable.
  - [173]/[174] radio “Car” — visible, enabled, checked.
  - [179]/[180] radio “Foot” — visible, enabled, unchecked.
  - [182] combobox “Directions services” — value='OSRM', enabled.
  - [526]/[528]/[529] route summary — still shows Distance '2368km' and Time '26:58', indicating the route hasn’t updated to the new origin and is incorrect for the goal.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Recalculate the origin locally: Press Enter in the “From” textbox [194] to resolve “CVS Pharmacy, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA” and update the route.
- Switch to walking: Click the “Foot” radio button [179] to compute walking distance.

Goal: Measure the walking distance between the closest CVS and UPMC Shadyside.

Current state:
- We are on the OpenStreetMap Directions page.
- “To” is correctly set to UPMC Shadyside (full address visible).
- “From” shows text “CVS, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA,” but the route summary still shows an old long car route (2368km) from New Mexico, meaning the origin/destination in the URL and route haven’t updated.
- Pressing Enter in the From field previously resulted in a “Search failed” modal twice, which we closed. Repeating the same Enter action is likely futile.

Plan:
- Try a different approach to force recalculation: use “Reverse Directions” to swap endpoints so that “From” becomes UPMC Shadyside (known-good), and “To” becomes the old far-away point. Then I can edit the “To” field to “CVS, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA” and submit. Historically, sometimes the search resolves better for the destination field than the origin field. After we get a local route, we’ll switch to Foot mode to obtain the walking distance.

Next action:

- Try a different approach to force recalculation: use “Reverse Directions” to swap endpoints so that “From” becomes UPMC Shadyside (known-good), and “To” becomes the old far-away point. Then I can edit the “To” field to “CVS, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA” and submit. Historically, sometimes the search resolves better for the destination field than the origin field. After we get a local route, we’ll switch to Foot mode to obtain the walking distance.

Next action:
- Click the “Reverse Directions” button (bid 200) to swap endpoints and set the stage for updating the “To” field to CVS in the next step.

✅ Current Progress:
- OpenStreetMap Directions panel is open.
- “To” is correctly set to UPMC Shadyside, 5230 Centre Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA ([199]).
- “From” has been populated with “CVS, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA” ([194]).
- A “Search failed” modal was dismissed previously; “Reverse Directions” was clicked ([200]).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path (OSM Directions), but the current route is incorrect and unrelated to the goal: the summary shows Distance 2368 km and Time 26:58 ([526], [528], [529]) with long driving steps across multiple states, indicating the origin did not resolve locally.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Mode selection radios: Car ([173], checked=true), Bicycle ([176], unchecked), Foot ([179], unchecked). All visible and enabled.
  - “From” textbox ([194]) visible, filled with “CVS, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA” but unresolved.
  - “To” textbox ([199]) visible, resolved to UPMC Shadyside, editable.
  - “Reverse Directions” button ([200]) visible.
  - “Directions services” combobox ([182]) set to OSRM, expanded=false.
- Status: Off-track due to an incorrect, long-distance route; origin needs to be corrected to a local CVS before switching to Foot mode.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Type “CVS, Pittsburgh, PA 15232” into the “From” textbox ([194]).
- Press Enter in the “From” textbox ([194]) to resolve a local CVS and recalculate the route. After a local route appears, switch to the “Foot” radio ([179]) to get walking distance.

The user wants the walking distance between the closest CVS and UPMC Shadyside. We’re on OpenStreetMap’s Directions page with:
- “To” correctly set to UPMC Shadyside (full address).
- “From” currently shows “CVS, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA,” but the route hasn’t updated and still shows a 2368km driving route from Cannon AFB (Clovis, NM), meaning the origin isn’t resolved locally.

Attempts so far:
- Pressing Enter in the From field triggered a “Search failed” modal twice.
- Clicking “Reverse Directions” timed out (element likely not interactable at that moment).
- Given the search failures, I should try a more specific, ZIP-anchored query for the From field to help the geocoder resolve locally around 15232 (Shadyside’s ZIP).

Plan:
- Replace the “From” field with “CVS, Pittsburgh, PA 15232” to bias the geocoder to the correct neighborhood.
- Then in a subsequent step, I’ll press Enter to resolve and compute a route; after that, switch mode to Foot to get walking distance.

Immediate next step: fill the From textbox [194] with the more specific query.

✅ Current Progress:
- OpenStreetMap Directions panel is open and set to walking (radio “Foot” [179] checked=true).
- Endpoints:
  - From: “CVS Pharmacy, Centre Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA” ([194], focused).
  - To: “UPMC Shadyside, 5230, Centre Avenue, … 15232, United States” ([199]).
- A distance readout is visible showing 2.2 km and 0:29 ([526] -> [528], [529]) from a previously calculated route.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path to the goal (directions view).
- Relevant interactive elements and state:
  - Mode selectors: Car [173] (unchecked), Bicycle [176] (unchecked), Foot [179] (checked).
  - From textbox [194]: filled with “CVS Pharmacy, Centre Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA”, focused; not yet submitted/resolved to a specific POI.
  - To textbox [199]: filled with UPMC Shadyside; valid and visible.
  - Distance readout container [526]: shows “2.2km” ([528]) and “0:29” ([529]); likely reflects the prior route (before updating the From field).
  - Reverse Directions button [200]: visible.
  - Directions services combobox [182]: “OSRM”, expanded=false.
- Gap vs goal: The “closest CVS” requirement isn’t confirmed; the route/distance displayed appears stale and does not reflect the newly entered “From” value.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Submit the updated origin to recalculate locally: press Enter in the From textbox [194].
- After the route recalculates in Foot mode, read the updated walking distance in the distance readout [526] -> [528].

Objective: Provide the walking distance between UPMC Shadyside and the closest CVS. The Directions panel is already open, with routing mode set to Foot (radio [179] checked). The "To" field contains UPMC Shadyside’s full address ([199]). The "From" field currently shows "CVS Pharmacy, Centre Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA" ([194]) and appears focused, but the distance readout still shows 2.2km and 0:29, which likely corresponds to the prior route from a different CVS (Squirrel Hill North) rather than the Centre Avenue CVS near UPMC Shadyside. Therefore, the route likely hasn’t been recalculated with the new "From" input yet.

Plan: Submit the "From" field to resolve it to the specific Centre Avenue CVS and trigger route recalculation in Foot mode. Then, I can read the updated "Distance" value (which should be shorter if this is indeed the nearest CVS).

Next action: Press Enter in the "From" textbox ([194]) to submit and recalculate the route.

The user wants the walking distance between UPMC Shadyside and the closest CVS. I’m on the OpenStreetMap directions page with routing mode set to Foot. The “From” field is “CVS Pharmacy, 4610, Centre Avenue, North Oakland, Bellefield, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States,” and the “To” field is “UPMC Shadyside, 5230, Centre Avenue, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, United States.” The directions summary clearly shows Distance: 1.1km and Time: 0:15, which matches the requirement to report a walking distance. Since the UI is already showing a specific CVS on Centre Avenue (which is plausibly the closest) and the distance is presented, the best next step is to report this result to the user concisely, ensuring distance is formatted without a space as per instructions and including minimal context for clarity.
