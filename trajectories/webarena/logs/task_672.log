The user needs review titles for a specific product on One Stop Market and then to post them on a forum. First, I should locate the product page. The homepage has a search bar (combobox with bid 372) which is ideal for quickly finding a specific product without scrolling or navigating nested menus. The "Search" button appears disabled initially, but typically becomes enabled after entering text, or pressing Enter will trigger the search.

  - Search button (id: 377, text “Search”): visible; no disabled state indicated.

The user’s goal is two-part: first, collect review titles for the specified product with ratings of 3 stars or less on One Stop Market; second, post those titles to the games subreddit/forum. I’m currently on the One Stop Market homepage, and the search combobox (bid 372) is already filled with “Nintendo Switch Fortnite Wildcat Console EU”. There is an autocomplete suggestion listbox (bid 2020) showing a matching option (bid 2021) for the exact product name. Clicking the suggestion should navigate me directly to the product page, which is the fastest path to access reviews without needing to perform a general search and then pick from results. From there, I can look for the reviews section and any filters to extract titles for reviews rated 3 stars or less. So the next best action is to click the autocomplete option (bid 2021).

I should save these titles and the required submission title before navigating to the forum site to create the post. Using take_note will help preserve the exact wording for when I compose the submission in the games forum.

The user wants me to collect the titles of reviews rated 3 stars or less for the Nintendo Switch Fortnite Wildcat Console EU on OneStopShop and then post them to the games subreddit with the title "real user feedback on Nintendo Switch Fortnite Wildcat Console EU". I’m currently on the product page with the Reviews tab open, and I can see ratings displayed as percentages where 20% = 1 star, 40% = 2 stars, 60% = 3 stars, 80% = 4 stars, and 100% = 5 stars. On Page 1, the eligible review titles (≤3 stars) are:
- EU charger and wild cat card doesn’t even work! (20%)
- REFUND REJECTED (20%)
- Charging port not compatible (20%)
- not compatible in the US (20%)
- Wildcard Bonus Credits Not Redeemable! (20%)

On Page 2, the eligible title is:
- Code not available!! (20%)

I should save these titles and the required submission title before navigating to the forum site to create the post. Using take_note will help preserve the exact wording for when I compose the submission in the games forum.

The task has two parts: 1) extract review titles with ratings of 3 stars or less from the Nintendo Switch Fortnite Wildcat Console EU product page on OneStopShop; 2) post those titles in the games subreddit with the specified title. I’ve already gathered and saved the eligible titles from both review pages via a note. The next step is to navigate to the forum site to create the post. Per the Reddit Task Tips, the forum lives at http://10.177.37.113:9999/forums/all, where I can find the "games" forum and create a submission. Therefore, I should navigate directly to that forum page to proceed with posting.
