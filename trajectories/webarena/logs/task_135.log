The user asks: "How many commits did Eric and Kilian make to a11yproject on 1/3/2023?" We are on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. The likely target is "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" repository listed in the projects. To answer, we need to navigate into that repository and view the commits on the specific date 1/3/2023. The page provides a link with accessible name "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" (bid 394). Once inside, we can go to the Repository -> Commits tab and locate commits on 1/3/2023. Since only one action is permitted per step, the best next action is to click into the a11yproject.com repository.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the a11yproject.com project page on GitLab.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to the goal; we need to access the commit history for 1/3/2023. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link “2,320 Commits” (node [687]) — visible and clickable; should lead directly to the commits list.
- Sidebar link “Repository” (node [297]) — visible and clickable; another route to commit history if needed.
No errors or unrelated content blocking progress.

The user asks for the number of commits Eric and Kilian made to the a11yproject repository on 1/3/2023. We’re already on the a11yproject.com repository page. The most direct way to find commit counts by date is to open the repository’s commit history. On this page, there is a prominent link labeled “2,320 Commits” (bid 687) in the project stats area. Clicking this should navigate to the commits list where I can look for filtering or date-grouped entries to identify commits on January 3, 2023 and attribute them to Eric and Kilian. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best step is to click the "2,320 Commits" link to access the commit history.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the a11yproject.com repository’s Commits page (main branch), where commits are listed and grouped by date.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to determine commits on 1/3/2023. The commit list is grouped by date (e.g., “14 Mar, 2023 …”), and a block labeled “03 Jan, 2023 — 1 commit” is visible toward the lower part of the current view in the screenshot. Relevant interactive elements:
- Button “Author” (node [800], hasPopup=menu, expanded=False, visible) — can filter commits by a specific author (e.g., Eric or Kilian).
- Searchbox “Search by message” (node [842], visible, empty) — not directly useful for date/author filtering.
- Branch selector “main” (button [588], expanded=False) — correctly set to main; no change needed.
- Commits list container (node [847]) — visible; contains date-grouped listitems with commit rows you can click to open details. The date headers show counts per day (e.g., “03 Jan, 2023 — 1 commit”).

No errors detected; the page content is relevant to the goal.

The user asks for the number of commits made by Eric and Kilian on 1/3/2023 in the a11yproject repository. We are already on the Commits page for The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com on the main branch. The list is grouped by date, and there is a section labeled "03 Jan, 2023 — 1 commit". Inside that section, I see a single commit entry authored by Eric Bailey ("Add resource (#1496)") at Jan 3, 2023 2:11am GMT. There are no commits by Kilian in that date group. Therefore, Eric has 1 commit and Kilian has 0 commits on that date. The next step is to send the concise answer to the user.
