The user wants me to open an issue about a "connection refused" problem in ChatGPT. To create an issue in GitLab, I need to navigate to the appropriate project first, then go to the Issues section and create a new issue. From the current Projects dashboard, I should select the most relevant repository. Among the listed projects, "Byte Blaze / chatgpt_plugin" seems the most appropriate place to file an issue about ChatGPT connection problems. Therefore, my next step is to click the "Byte Blaze / chatgpt_plugin" link to enter that project's page, from which I can then navigate to Issues and create a new one. I will avoid using global search per the tips, and the link [916] is visible and clickable.

 <think>
The user's goal was to open an issue reporting a connection refused problem in ChatGPT. Reviewing the current page, I see the issue detail view for Byte Blaze / chatgpt_plugin with the heading "Connection refused error in ChatGPT plugin," status "Open," and breadcrumbs showing "#1," which confirms the issue has been successfully created. Since the goal is achieved, the best next step is to inform the user with a clear summary, including the issue number, title, status, and a direct link, and offer to add more details or labels if desired. Only one action is allowed, so I will use send_msg_to_user to provide the completion confirmation.
