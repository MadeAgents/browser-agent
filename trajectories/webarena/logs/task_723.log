The task is to like (upvote) all submissions created by user FTorrez81 in the forum named iphone13. I need to navigate to the forum list to find the iphone13 forum, as per the task tips: use the "Forums" tab and then "alphabetical" to locate the forum by name. From the current page, I can see the top navigation with a "Forums" link (bid 43). The first step is to click "Forums" to get to the forum directory. Once there, I will look for an alphabetical listing and then locate iphone13, enter that forum, and then find posts by FTorrez81 to upvote them. Starting with clicking "Forums" should move us towards the right area.

The user's goal is to like all submissions created by FTorrez81 in the forum named "iphone13". According to the task tips, to find a specific forum, it's best to use the "Alphabetical" option under the "Forum" tab. On the current "List of forums" page, I can see the navigation links "Forums", "Tags", and "Alphabetical" with "Alphabetical" having bid [117]. Clicking "Alphabetical" should take me to an alphabetical listing of forums where I can locate "iphone13" quickly. Scrolling is discouraged, and using filtering/navigation is recommended.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is not on the optimal path to the goal. It shows a single content result unrelated to the target forum and user.
- link “Forums” (id [36]): visible, enabled — relevant to navigate to the forum directory.
- searchbox “Search query” (id [112]): filled with “iphone13”; Search button (id [115]) enabled — appears to search site content, not forums.
- result heading link “Why a lot of iphone13 on marketplace?” (id [124]): visible, links to a post in forum “iphone” (link id [132]); author link “curly_crazy_curious” (id [128]) — not FTorrez81.
- button “Upvote” (id [148]): enabled — off-target since the post is not by FTorrez81 and not in the “iphone13” forum.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link “Forums” (id [36]) to return to the forum directory and then proceed to locate the “iphone13” forum.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link with text “Go to home page” (id [12]) to return to the site’s main navigation and resume locating the correct forum.

✅ Current Progress: Returned to the home feed. No progress made yet on liking submissions by FTorrez81 in the “iphone13” forum.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is the site’s home/submissions feed filtered to “Subscribed” and sorted by “Hot,” which is not directly related to finding the “iphone13” forum or FTorrez81’s posts. Relevant interactive elements:
- link “Forums” (id [43]): visible, enabled — leads to the forum directory.
- searchbox “Search query” (id [55]): visible, empty, enabled — site-wide search.
- buttons “Filter on: Subscribed” (id [123]) and “Sort by: Hot” (id [138]) — not relevant to the goal.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link “Forums” (id [43]) to navigate to the forum directory and locate “iphone13.”
- Alternatively, type “iphone13” into the searchbox (id [55]) and press Enter to search for the forum.

🔍 Current State Analysis:

- Relevant interactive elements:
  - searchbox “Search query” (id [55]): visible, enabled, focused, value='FTorrez81'.
  - link “Forums” (id [43]): visible, enabled — leads to forum directory.
  - buttons “Filter on: Subscribed” (id [123]) and “Sort by: Hot” (id [138]): visible, enabled — not directly useful for the goal.
  - Per-article voting controls (e.g., “Retract upvote” [185], “Downvote” [195], etc.) are present on items currently authored by “MarvelsGrantMan136,” not relevant to FTorrez81.
- Prior direct navigation to /f/iphone13 resulted in a 404 Not Found, so the forum must be located via in-site navigation or search results.

The user’s goal is to like (upvote) all submissions created by the user FTorrez81 in the forum named iphone13. From the current home page, I’ve already filled the global search box with “FTorrez81,” but I haven’t executed a search yet. According to the Task Tips, when looking for submissions by a particular user, the most reliable path is to visit the user’s profile to see their list of submissions. Navigating directly to the user profile will likely present their submissions in a single page with forum labels (“in <forum>”) next to each item, allowing me to identify which ones belong to the iphone13 forum and upvote them without needing to search site-wide.

Trying to locate the “iphone13” forum first was problematic: the alphabetical forum list did not show “iphone13” and a direct attempt to open /f/iphone13 produced a 404. Therefore, accessing the user profile is the more efficient route at this point. On Postmill-like platforms, user profiles are usually available at /u/<username>. I will navigate directly to http://10.177.37.113:9999/u/FTorrez81. Once there, I can find the Submissions tab (if not default), identify posts in the “iphone13” forum, and then upvote them.

Thus, the next best single action is to navigate directly to the user profile URL.

- Verified the “iphone13” forum does not exist (direct visit to /f/iphone13 returned 404; not listed under Forums > Alphabetical).
- Observed no submissions by FTorrez81 in “iphone13”; the only visible submission is in “iphone.”

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (user’s Submissions) is on the critical path for the goal, but it shows no items in “iphone13,” so there is nothing to like that matches the goal.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - “Upvote” button [143] — enabled/visible (for a post in “iphone,” not “iphone13”).
  - “Downvote” button [153] — enabled/visible.
  - Submission title link [124] — opens the post.
  - Forum link “iphone” [132] — indicates the post’s forum; not the target.
  - Tabs: “Overview” [112], “Submissions” [114] (current), “Comments” [116] — all visible/enabled.
  - Search box “Search query” [49] — visible/focusable.
- Conclusion: Based on the 404 for /f/iphone13 and absence in the forum directory, the target forum/submissions appear unavailable; the goal is currently infeasible.
