The user's goal is to like (upvote) all submissions created by the user "Hrekires" in the forum called "news". On this Postmill site, "subreddit" corresponds to "forum". To efficiently find the forum "news" and then filter for posts by a specific user, the best first step is to navigate to the Forums page where I can locate the "news" forum (the tips mention using the Forums tab and Alphabetical view). From there, I can enter the forum and then look for a search/filter or view that allows filtering by author or search for the user's submissions within that forum. Currently, I'm on the home page showing subscribed forums; "news" isn't in the sidebar subscription list, so going to Forums is appropriate. I see the "Forums" link in the top navigation (node [43]).

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is directly on the critical path to the goal (listing submissions in the news forum).
- link 'Submissions' (node [123]): visible/clickable; ensures the list shows posts rather than comments.
- button 'Sort by: Hot' (node [128], hasPopup menu): visible/enabled; optional for changing ordering.

- button 'Upvote' for Hrekires’ submission (node [207]): visible/enabled; this is the control to “like” the submission.
- Other articles on the page have Upvote buttons (e.g., nodes [169], [245], etc.) but are not by Hrekires and are not relevant to the goal.

✅ Current Progress: 
- Navigated to /f/news.
- Located a submission by Hrekires (“Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly wins re-election…”).
- Clicked the vote control on that submission, but it was labeled “Retract upvote,” so this action likely removed the like instead of adding one.

🔍 Current State Analysis: 
- The current page (/f/news) is directly aligned with the goal of liking Hrekires’ submissions in this forum.
- Relevant elements:
  - searchbox “Search query” (node [57]): visible, empty, enabled — can be used to filter by author (e.g., author:Hrekires).
  - navigation link “Submissions” (node [123]): visible/clickable — ensures the list is posts, not comments.
  - article with author link “Hrekires” (node [194]) — confirms the target post.
  - vote button for that article (node [207]) currently labeled “Retract upvote” in the provided tree — indicates the post was upvoted at the time of capture; the recent click likely toggled it off.
- Status: On the correct forum page but an action has likely undone a required like on a Hrekires post.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
1) Re-apply the like you removed: click the vote button in the Hrekires article again (button node [207]) to ensure it is upvoted.
2) Find all Hrekires posts in this forum: type “author:Hrekires” into the searchbox labeled “Search query” (node [57]) and submit the search; then upvote each resulting submission by Hrekires.

Objective: Like (upvote) all submissions created by the user "Hrekires" within the "news" forum. We are on /f/news and can see at least one submission by Hrekires. Using the forum search didn’t work (global search returned no results), and per the Task Tips, the best way to find a user’s submissions is via their profile. From there, I can look through their submissions and upvote those that belong to the news forum. On the current page, the "Submitted by" line for the visible Hrekires post includes a clickable link to the user profile ("Hrekires" link with bid [194]). The next best step is to click that user link to navigate to their profile where I can access a consolidated list of their submissions and then filter/identify those from the news forum to upvote.

The goal is to like (upvote) all submissions created by Hrekires in the "news" forum. I’m currently on the Hrekires profile page, which shows a mix of comments and submissions. I can identify the submissions by the “Submitted by Hrekires … in news” text. I see four such submissions on this page:
- “Gov. Whitmer signs bills to repeal right to work, restore prevailing wage” — in news, with an Upvote button [875]
- “Disney World deal with union will raise minimum wage to $18 an hour” — in news, with an Upvote button [968]
- “Judge halts Wyoming abortion ban days after it took effect” — in news, with an Upvote button [1008]
- “‘Don’t Say Gay’ lawmaker pleads guilty to COVID relief fraud” — in news, with an Upvote button [1048]

To start fulfilling the task, I should upvote each of these. Since only one action is allowed per step, I’ll begin by upvoting the first visible news submission: “Gov. Whitmer signs bills to repeal right to work, restore prevailing wage” using its Upvote button [875]. After this, I can proceed to the other three in subsequent steps.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to user profile “Hrekires” and opened the “Submissions” tab.
- Liked (upvoted) multiple “news” submissions previously (e.g., “Gov. Whitmer…,” “Disney World deal…,” “Judge halts Wyoming abortion ban…,” “‘Don’t Say Gay’ lawmaker pleads guilty…”).
- On the current Submissions view, all top visible “news” posts show as liked (their vote control reads “Retract upvote”).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (“Submissions” on the Hrekires profile) is on the critical path for the goal since it consolidates all of the user’s posts, including those in “news.”
- Relevant interactive elements and states:
  - Navigation: “Overview” (id=112), “Submissions” (id=114, current), “Comments” (id=116) — all visible and enabled.
  - Visible “news” submissions and vote controls (all enabled, currently liked):
    - “Gov. Whitmer signs bills to repeal right to work, restore prevailing wage” — button labeled “Retract upvote” (id=143).
    - “Disney World deal with union will raise minimum wage to $18 an hour” — button labeled “Retract upvote” (id=183).
    - “Judge halts Wyoming abortion ban days after it took effect” — button labeled “Retract upvote” (id=223).
  - Each item also shows a “Downvote” button (e.g., ids 153, 193, 233), not needed for this task.
- The list likely continues beyond the initially visible items; any additional “news” submissions further down may still need verification/upvoting. No errors or off-track indicators detected.

The user’s goal is to like (upvote) all submissions by Hrekires in the news forum. I am on the user’s Submissions page, which lists their posts across forums. I need to identify which entries belong to the “news” forum and ensure they are upvoted.

From the accessibility tree on this page:
- The first four “news” submissions already show “Retract upvote” (ids 143, 183, 223, 263), indicating they’re liked.
- Additional “news” submissions further down are not yet upvoted; their buttons show “Upvote”:
  - Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs refuses to proceed with execution set by court — Upvote [303]
  - Tennessee governor OKs bill to cut Nashville council in half — Upvote [343]
  - Philadelphia DA Larry Krasner impeached by Pa. House — Upvote [422]
  - Crypto giant FTX to file for bankruptcy — Upvote [462]
  - SEC, DOJ Investigating Crypto Platform FTX — Upvote [502]
  - Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly wins re-election — Upvote [542]

Since only one action is allowed per step, I will begin by clicking the Upvote button on the first not-yet-liked “news” submission in the list, which is “Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs refuses to proceed with execution set by court” (button id 303). I will proceed to upvote the remaining ones in subsequent steps.
