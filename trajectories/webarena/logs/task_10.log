The user wants the full address of all US international airports within a 60 km driving distance to Niagara Falls. I should use OpenStreetMap’s search and directions. First, I need to center on Niagara Falls (USA side) to run directions from there. The search field is focused (bid 162). I'll search "Niagara Falls, New York" to ensure the US city. After that, I can use the directions tool to check driving distances to nearby international airports (likely Niagara Falls International Airport and Buffalo Niagara International Airport), and then open each airport’s OSM detail to extract the full address including ZIP code. The first step is to fill the search box.

- [162] textbox labeled “Search” — value set to “Niagara Falls, New York”, focused.
- [165] button labeled “Go” — visible and appears enabled; not clicked yet (map view still not centered on Niagara Falls).
- [167] link “Find directions between two points” — visible; useful for checking driving distances.
- [217] button “Close” — closes the welcome overlay that may obstruct map interactions.
- [454] link “Query features” — visible; useful to inspect airport features and retrieve address details once centered on the area.

The page is on the critical path; executing the search and then using directions and feature queries will enable identification of qualifying airports and their full addresses.

The user's goal is to find the full address of all US international airports within a 60 km driving distance to Niagara Falls, and to extract the full addresses from OpenStreetMap. I should:
1) Center the map on Niagara Falls, NY using the search.
2) Use the directions tool to check driving distance to candidate international airports nearby (likely Niagara Falls International Airport and Buffalo Niagara International Airport), ensuring they are within 60 km.
3) Open each airport’s OSM feature page/details to capture the full address including street number, street, city, state, ZIP code, and country.
The search box [162] already contains “Niagara Falls, New York” and is focused, so the next logical step is to execute the search by clicking the “Go” button [165] to center the map on Niagara Falls and proceed with directions.

  - [182] combobox “Directions services” — value “OSRM”, enabled.
  - [529]–[533] route summary — Distance currently shows “11km” (unchanged from the Niagara Falls International Airport route), indicating the new route for Buffalo has not been computed yet.
- The page is on-track; next step is to compute the Buffalo Niagara International Airport route to confirm it is within 60 km and then read its full address from OSM.

The user wants the full address (with ZIP code) of all US international airports within 60 km driving distance to Niagara Falls, using OpenStreetMap only. I’m already on the OSM Directions page, with Car mode selected, “To” set to Niagara Falls, and the “From” field currently filled with “Buffalo Niagara International Airport.” The route has not been recomputed yet (the summary still shows 11km from the previous IAG route). To verify that Buffalo Niagara International Airport is within 60 km, I need to compute this route. On this UI, pressing Enter in the From field triggers the route calculation. After confirming the distance is under 60 km, I will next fetch the full addresses for both airports from OSM (likely by closing directions and searching each airport to open the feature details sidebar which contains the full address including ZIP). For now, the best next single action is to press Enter on the From field to compute the new route.

✅ Current Progress:
- Confirmed Niagara Falls International Airport is within 60 km of Niagara Falls. Recorded address from OSM: “Niagara Falls International Airport, 2035, Niagara Falls Boulevard, City of Niagara Falls, Town of Wheatfield, Niagara County, New York, 14304, United States.”
- Confirmed Buffalo Niagara International Airport is within 60 km. Current route shows 41 km driving distance. Recorded address from OSM: “Buffalo-Niagara International Airport, Holtz Drive, Town of Cheektowaga, Erie County, New York, 14225, United States.”

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The OpenStreetMap Directions page is directly supporting the goal (verifying driving distance and capturing full OSM addresses).
- Relevant elements and states:
  - [173] radio “Car” — checked (appropriate for driving distance).
  - [182] combobox “Directions services” — value “OSRM”, enabled.
  - [194] textbox “From” — value: “Buffalo-Niagara International Airport, Holtz Drive, Town of Cheektowaga, Erie County, New York, 14225, United States”, focused, editable.
  - [199] textbox “To” — value: “Niagara Falls, City of Niagara Falls, Niagara County, New York, United States”, visible, editable.
  - [529]–[533] route summary — Distance: “41km”; Time: “0:41”.
- The page is on-track. Two US international airports have been verified within 60 km, and their OSM-formatted addresses have been captured. Remaining consideration: confirm whether there are any additional US “international” airports within 60 km (none identified on this page so far).

The user asks for the full address of all US international airports within 60 km driving distance to Niagara Falls, and the addresses must come from OpenStreetMap. I am on the OSM directions page, already using Car mode. The “To” field is set to “Niagara Falls, City of Niagara Falls, Niagara County, New York, United States.” I have routes computed for two airports:
- Niagara Falls International Airport (IAG): previously computed route showed 11km and the From field displayed a full OSM address with street number and ZIP.
- Buffalo-Niagara International Airport (BUF): current route shows Distance: 41km and the From field displays the OSM address including ZIP (though OSM does not provide a street number here).

No other US international airports are within 60 km of Niagara Falls (Rochester is far >60 km, Erie is >60 km; Canadian airports are not in scope). Therefore, I can now provide the two addresses as returned by OSM, ensuring the ZIP codes are included and using the exact wording as shown in the OSM fields.

I will send the addresses to the user in a concise format as required.
