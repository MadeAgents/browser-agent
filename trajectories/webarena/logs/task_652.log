The user wants me to reply to the post with the exact comment "???". On the current page, I can see the "Comments" section with a textarea labeled "Comment" (accessibility id [173]) and a "Post" button (id [313]). To submit the comment, I should first fill the comment textarea with the exact text "???", then click the "Post" button. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best action is to fill the comment box with "???". After that, I will click the Post button in the following step.
