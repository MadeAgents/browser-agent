✅ Current Progress: Navigated to Reports > Sales > Orders and reached the Orders Report page with filters visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly relevant to the goal of looking up canceled orders. The report table includes a “Canceled” column for the selected time range. Key interactive elements:
- button “Show Report” [726] — visible.
- combobox “Date Used” [753] — current value: “Order Created”.
- combobox “Period” [761] — current value: “Day”.
- textbox “From *” [769] — required, currently empty.
- textbox “To *” [776] — required, currently empty.
- combobox “Order Status” [783] — current value: “Any” (note: filter applies to specified statuses except canceled; canceled totals appear in the “Canceled” column).
- button “All Websites” (Scope) [709] — visible, has popup.
- “Export to” combobox [821] (CSV) and “Export” button [824] — visible.
Current table state shows “0 records found” and “We couldn’t find any records.”, likely due to missing required date range. The page is on the critical path; setting a valid From/To range and running the report should surface canceled totals.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Reports > Sales > Orders (Orders Report page).
- Set date range: From [769] = 01/01/2022; To [776] = 12/17/2025.
- Changed “Order Status” to “Specified” in the filter (combobox [783]).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The Orders Report page is relevant to the goal, but it provides aggregated metrics (including a “Canceled” column) rather than a per-order list.
- Important interactive elements:
  - button “Show Report” [726] — visible/enabled.
  - combobox “Order Status” [783] — value “Specified”, expanded; options shown: “Any” [784] (not selected) and “Specified” [785] (selected). Note: The helper text indicates this filter applies to specified statuses except canceled orders.
  - textbox “From *” [769] — filled: 01/01/2022.
  - textbox “To *” [776] — filled: 12/17/2025.
  - combobox “Date Used” [753] — value “Order Created”, collapsed.
  - combobox “Period” [761] — value “Day”, collapsed.
  - Export controls: “Export to” [821] (CSV) and “Export” button [824] — visible.
- Current results area shows “0 records found.” To see canceled order statistics, the report must be run and the “Canceled” column in the results reviewed. If a detailed list of canceled orders is required, this report may be insufficient; typically the Sales > Orders grid is used to filter and list orders with Status = Canceled.

The user wants to look up canceled orders. We are on the Orders Report page under Reports with date range already set from 01/01/2022 to 12/17/2025. The Order Status combobox is set to “Specified,” but this report’s status filter note indicates it excludes canceled orders from the specified statuses, and instead presents a “Canceled” column in the results. To populate the table and see canceled counts, we need to run the report. The table currently shows “0 records found,” likely because the report hasn’t been executed yet. The next best step is to click “Show Report” to generate the results so we can view the “Canceled” column per interval.
