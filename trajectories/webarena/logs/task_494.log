The task is to notify Alex Thomas in their most recent pending order with a specific message. In Magento, this is typically done by navigating to Sales > Orders, finding the customer's pending orders, opening the most recent one, and adding a comment with "Notify Customer" checked. From the current dashboard, I should start by opening the Sales section to access Orders. The left navigation shows a "SALES" link (bid 156). Clicking that should reveal the Orders grid or submenu where I can proceed to filter/sort. Since only one action is allowed per step, the best next step is to click the SALES menu to get to the orders area.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the Orders page in Magento Admin. No notification has been sent and Alex Thomas’s orders have not been located yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path for notifying a customer via their order. The orders grid is currently filtered to “Bill-to Name: Grace Nguyen,” which is unrelated to the goal.
- Active filter: “Bill-to Name: Grace Nguyen” is shown with “15 records found.”
- Relevant controls:
  - Button “Clear all” [857]: visible and clickable.
  - Textbox “Search by keyword” [840]: visible, currently empty.
  - Button “Search” [841]: visible and clickable.
  - Button “Filters” [845]: visible and clickable (for advanced filtering like Status).
  - Columnheader “Purchase Date” [1390]: visible (for sorting to find most recent).
  - Action links “View” (per row): visible in the grid for opening an order detail.
This filter puts the agent off-track from finding Alex Thomas’s most recent pending order.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button “Clear all” [857] to remove the Grace Nguyen filter.
- Type “Alex Thomas” into textbox “Search by keyword” [840], then click button “Search” [841] to locate Alex Thomas’s orders.

The goal is to notify Alex Thomas on their most recent pending order. The Orders grid currently has active filters: Bill-to Name "Alex Thomas" and Status "Pending", resulting in "0 records found." To locate Alex’s orders, I should broaden the results by removing the Status filter first, keeping the Bill-to Name filter. This should display all orders for Alex Thomas, from which I can then sort by Purchase Date descending and identify any pending orders. The button to remove the Status: Pending filter is [9208], so clicking it is the next best action.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Sales > Orders.
- Applied filters for Status = Pending and Bill-to Name = “Alex Thomas.”
- Removed the Status: Pending filter to broaden results.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The Orders grid is the correct place to locate the order and add a customer notification.
- Current result shows “0 records found” and the table displays “We couldn't find any records.”
- Active elements relevant to progress:
  - Active filter “Bill-to Name: Alex Thomas” with remove button [9225]: visible/enabled.
  - “Clear all” filters button [857]: visible/enabled.
  - “Search by keyword” textbox [840]: empty, visible; “Search” button [841]: visible/enabled.
  - Column header “↓ Purchase Date” [1390]: visible (sortable) for identifying the most recent order once results appear.
- The remaining Bill-to Name filter still yields no records; adjustments are needed to surface Alex Thomas’s orders.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the remove button for the “Bill-to Name: Alex Thomas” filter [9225] (or use “Clear all” [857]) to reset filters.
- Type “Alex Thomas” into the “Search by keyword” textbox [840] and click the “Search” button [841] to locate matching orders.

The Orders grid currently shows "0 records found" with an active filter "Bill-to Name: Alex Thomas." This suggests the strict Bill-to Name filter is returning no matches.

The goal is to notify Alex Thomas on their most recent pending order. On the Orders grid, we previously cleared filters, and the table shows many records mostly from 2022. I noticed entries for "Alexander Thomas" rather than "Alex Thomas," which likely corresponds to the intended customer. To quickly narrow down to that customer’s orders, the most efficient next step is to use the “Search by keyword” textbox to search for “Alexander Thomas.” Once results load, I can then set Status to Pending via Filters and sort by Purchase Date descending to find the most recent pending order, open it, and add the notification comment. Therefore, I should now fill the search field with “Alexander Thomas.”

The goal is to notify Alex Thomas (listed as “Alexander Thomas”) in their most recent pending order with the specified message. I’m on the Sales > Orders grid with a keyword filter “Alexander Thomas” applied, and I have already performed the required sort operation on the “Purchase Date” column to set it to descending (“↓ Purchase Date”), satisfying the rule about sorting recent orders. In the results, I can see an order with Status “Pending” (ID 000000304) dated Apr 19, 2023. To send the notification, I need to open that order’s detail page where the “Comments History” section typically allows entering a comment, checking “Notify Customer,” and submitting. The next best single action is to click the “View” link for the pending order (ID 000000304) to access its details.

The user wants me to notify Alex Thomas (shown as Alexander Thomas) on their most recent pending order with the message provided. I am on the order detail page for Order #000000304, and the status is "Pending." In the "Notes for this Order" section, I can add a comment, select "Notify Customer by Email," and submit it. The relevant controls visible are:
- Comment textbox [1041]
- "Notify Customer by Email" checkbox [1045]
- "Submit Comment" button [1051]
The correct sequence is to first enter the message into the Comment field, then check the notify checkbox, and finally submit the comment. Since only one action is allowed per step, the best next action is to fill the Comment textbox with "Yo, your order will be shipped soon!".
