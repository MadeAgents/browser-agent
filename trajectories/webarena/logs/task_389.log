The user wants me to post a comment on a merge request related to the octovisuals page within the Primer/design project. I am currently on the Projects dashboard where I can see the "Primer / design" project listed with a clickable link element [357]. To proceed towards finding the merge request and commenting, I first need to navigate into the project. The best next step is to click the "Primer / design" project link. Once inside, I will look for the Merge requests tab and locate the specific MR about the octovisuals page, then add the comment. For now, I will click the project link to access its page.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the Primer/design project page on GitLab. No merge request has been opened yet and no comment has been posted.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward the goal; it’s the project home. To proceed, the merge requests list for this project must be accessed.
- Relevant elements:
  - Link: “Merge requests” in Project navigation (id/index [350], visible, enabled, shows count 16).
  - Global header link: “Merge requests” (id/index [185], visible, enabled) — broader scope across all projects.
  - Search field: “Search GitLab” textbox (id/index [146], visible, empty) — global search if needed.
  - Repository/README controls (e.g., “Find file”, “Web IDE”, “Clone”) are visible but not relevant to commenting on an MR.

The goal is to post a specific comment on the merge request related to the octovisuals page in the Primer/design project. I am currently on the Primer/design project page. To locate the relevant merge request, the next optimal step is to go to the project's Merge requests section. The left sidebar shows a "Merge requests" link within the Project navigation (bid 350) with a count of 16, which is the correct scope (project-level). Using this link is preferable over the global header Merge requests to avoid mixing with other projects. After clicking it, I will search/find the MR mentioning “octovisuals page”, open it, and then post the comment. For now, the next single action is to click the project's Merge requests link.
