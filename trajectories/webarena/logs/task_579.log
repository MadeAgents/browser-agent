The goal is to add the user "yjlou" as a Guest to the "timeit" project. I am on the "Project members" page with the "Invite members" modal open. The "Username or email address" field has "yjlou" and the suggestion has been selected, as evidenced by the listbox showing an option for "yjlou" with a removable "Close" button, indicating the user is added to the invite list. The role combobox shows "Guest" as the selected value, matching the requested role. The next step is to finalize the invitation by clicking the "Invite" button to submit the addition.
