The user wants the top-5 best-selling products specifically for 2023. The Dashboard’s “Bestsellers” widget shows a list but not filtered by year, so it’s not sufficient. According to the task tips, generating specific reports should be done via the REPORTS tab. From there, I can navigate to the appropriate products report (e.g., Bestsellers/Ordered Products) and set the date range for 2023. The first step is to open the REPORTS section from the left navigation menu. I see the REPORTS link in the menubar with bid 339. I will click that to proceed to the reports area.

The user asks for the top-5 best-selling products in 2023. The Reports overlay is open, showing a list with a "Products" section including "Bestsellers" (bid 431), which is the most relevant report for this task. To obtain the specific timeframe (2023), I should navigate to the Bestsellers report page where there will be date range fields (From/To) and a "Show Report" button. Once on that page, I'll set From to 01/01/2023 and To to 12/31/2023 (or the locale format the page expects), then run the report to view and extract the top-5. The current step is to click the "Bestsellers" link from the Reports overlay to reach that report page.
