The user wants to add two users as Maintainer to the repository kkroening/ffmpeg-python.

Therefore, the optimal next step is to navigate directly to the GitLab search results page for the project name "ffmpeg-python" using the prescribed URL format.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the target project page: “Karl Kroening / ffmpeg-python”.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to add maintainers. To proceed, you typically need to access the Members area and have sufficient permissions.
- Relevant elements:
  - Link “Project information” (node [276]); visible and clickable. This is where the Members page is usually located.
  - Link “Request Access” (node [523]); visible and enabled, indicating the current user is not a project member and likely lacks permission to add members.
  - Button with popup menu (node [527]); visible; may expose additional project actions depending on permissions.
  - Sidebar navigation links (e.g., “Repository” [295]) are present but not required for managing members.
- Note: Since “Request Access” is shown, adding users as Maintainer will likely require elevated access (Maintainer/Owner). If access is granted, navigate via Project information ➜ Members to invite users and assign the Maintainer role.

The sidebar shows a "Project information" link (bid 276). Clicking it is the logical next step to try to access the Members page and assess permissions.

The user’s goal is to add two users (“yjlou” and “a11yproject”) as Maintainers to the repository kkroening/ffmpeg-python. I navigated to the project’s Members page (as shown in the current tab). On this page, I see a notice: “Members can be added by project Maintainers or Owners.” The UI elements available include “Filter members,” “Search,” “Toggle history,” “Account” (a sorting/filter menu), and a members table. Critically, the blue “Invite members” button that should appear in the top right for authorized users is not present. The only listed member is “Karl Kroening @kkroening” with role “Owner.” This indicates my current account (“byteblaze”) does not have sufficient permissions (not a Maintainer/Owner) to add members.

Given the lack of the “Invite members” button and the permissions message, I cannot complete the requested action. The correct next step is to inform the user that adding members is infeasible without Maintainer/Owner privileges and suggest how they can proceed (grant my account appropriate access or add the users themselves via Project information > Members > Invite members with role Maintainer).

Therefore, I will report infeasibility with a clear reason and instructions for next steps.
