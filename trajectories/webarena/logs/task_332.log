The user asks for monthly spending totals from January through March 2023. To find this, I should navigate to the user's order history. On this site, the typical path is My Account > My Orders. From the current page (homepage), I see a "My Account" link with bid 227 in the banner. The best next step is to click "My Account" to reach the account dashboard, where I can then look for order history and aggregate spending by month.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to and opened the My Account dashboard (user logged in as Emma Lopez).

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal because it provides access to order history needed to total spending by month.
- Relevant elements:
  - Left navigation link “My Orders” (marker [1461], visible, enabled) — essential to access full order history for date-based review.
  - Main section “Recent Orders” (heading marker [1457]) with per-order “View Order” links (e.g., markers around [1481]–[1484], enabled) — shows only a few recent orders and is insufficient for aggregating Jan–Mar 2023 totals.
  - Other elements (Search combobox [266]/button [271] disabled; category menu items [281], etc.) are unrelated to the goal.

The user needs monthly spending totals for January through March 2023. To compute this, I must access the full order history and then either filter by date or manually aggregate orders in that date range. I’m currently on the My Account dashboard, where the left-hand navigation includes a "My Orders" link, which is the correct path for viewing comprehensive order history. The "Recent Orders" table only shows a few 2025 orders and won’t cover 2023. Therefore, the next best step is to click "My Orders" to reach the order list page, where I can look for date filters or navigate to earlier orders to identify all orders from Jan–Mar 2023 and sum them by month.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the “My Orders” page and loaded the orders table. Current view shows recent orders from 2025; no data from Jan–Mar 2023 has been collected yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to the goal because it lists order dates and totals needed to compute monthly spend.
- Relevant elements:
  - Orders table [1362] (“Orders”) with columns “Order #” [1366], “Date” [1367], “Order Total” [1368], “Status” [1369], “Action” [1370]; visible and readable.
  - Example row cells showing current (2025) data:
    - Date cells [1374], [1385], [1396] (values like “12/16/25”).
    - Order Total cells [1375], [1386], [1397] (values like “$15.27”, “$29.99”, “$55.06”).
    - “View Order” action links [1379], [1390], [1401] (enabled).
  - Pagination and “Show X per page” controls are visible at the bottom in the screenshot (showing “Items 1 to 10 of 45 total”), indicating older orders can be accessed to reach 2023 entries.
- Assessment: On-track. The necessary 2023 period is not yet visible; progress requires navigating to older pages (or increasing items per page) until dates from Jan–Mar 2023 appear, then reading Order Totals for those months.

The user needs monthly spending totals for January through March 2023. I’m on the “My Orders” page, which lists order dates and totals.

To efficiently access older orders (including early 2023) without navigating multiple pages, I should increase the items per page to the maximum (50). This will likely display all orders on a single page, making it easier to locate the Jan–Mar 2023 entries and compute monthly totals.

The user wants monthly spending totals from January through March 2023. I’m on the My Orders page with 50 items per page, so all orders are visible without pagination. I’ll identify orders in Jan–Mar 2023 and sum their Order Totals, excluding “Canceled” because canceled orders don’t represent money spent.

From the table:
- March 2023:
  - 3/11/23 — $65.32 — Complete
  - 3/10/23 — $17.99 — Complete
  Sum: 65.32 + 17.99 = 83.31

  - 2/24/23 — $231.54 — Canceled (exclude)
  - 2/11/23 — $174.99 — Canceled (exclude)
  - 2/9/23 — $185.32 — Complete
  Sum: 762.18 + 185.32 = 947.50

- January 2023:
  - 1/29/23 — $440.64 — Complete
  - 1/16/23 — $132.24 — Complete
