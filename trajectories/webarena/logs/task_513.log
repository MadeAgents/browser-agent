The user wants me to add a chair to their wish list. I’m on the homepage with a vertical navigation menu listing categories like “Home & Kitchen,” “Office Products,” etc. To find chairs, the best approach per the tips is to use the dropdown category navigation, which requires hovering to reveal subcategories. Chairs are likely under “Home & Kitchen” (e.g., Furniture → Chairs) or “Office Products” (Office Furniture → Chairs). I’ll start by hovering over “Home & Kitchen” (element [595]) to reveal its submenu and look for a chairs subcategory to click next.

The goal is to add a chair to the wish list. From the homepage, I already hovered over “Home & Kitchen,” revealing its submenu that includes “Furniture” (element [600]). To find chairs specifically, I should hover “Furniture” to expose its nested submenu where a “Chairs” subcategory is likely available. Once the “Chairs” option appears, I can click it to view chair products and then use “Add to Wish List” on a chair product. The immediate next step is to hover “Furniture” to reveal the chairs subcategory.

The user wants to add a chair to their wish list. I already hovered over “Home & Kitchen” and then “Furniture,” which revealed a submenu with several furniture categories. Since there’s no explicit “Chairs” item listed, the most likely path to find chairs is via “Home Office Furniture,” which commonly includes office chairs. Clicking this submenu item should navigate to a category page where I can look for chair products and then add one to the wish list. I will proceed by clicking “Home Office Furniture.”

The user asked to add a chair to their wish list. I’m already on the “Home Office Furniture” category page showing a grid of products, including multiple chairs. Each product card has an “Add to Wish List” button. To fulfill the task efficiently, I should select any chair product and click its “Add to Wish List” button.

From the visible items:
- The product titled “Flash Furniture Low Back Designer Armless White Ribbed Swivel Task Office Chair” has an associated “Add to Wish List” button with bid [1483].
- This is clearly a chair and the button is readily accessible.

The best next step is to click the “Add to Wish List” button [1483] for that chair to add it to the wish list. After this, I can verify the wish list count or a confirmation message on the page in a subsequent step if needed.
