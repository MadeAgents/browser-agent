The goal is to upvote the newest post in the books subreddit, which corresponds to a "forum" on this site. From the current homepage, there are no featured forums shown. To locate the "books" forum, I should navigate to the Forums section. The top navigation contains a "Forums" link (bid 42). Clicking it should lead to a list of forums where I can use alphabetical sorting if needed, then find "books", enter it, sort by "new", and upvote the newest post.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the /f/books forum page. Sorting is still set to “Hot”; no switch to “New” yet and no upvote performed.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to upvoting the newest post.
- Sorting control: button “Sort by: Hot” (id [128], hasPopup=menu, expanded=False; visible and enabled). Needs to be changed to “New” to surface the newest post.
- Posts list: Multiple article entries are visible. Each entry has:
  - Upvote button (e.g., [169] for the first listed article, [206] for the second, [244] for the third; all visible and enabled).
- User status: Logged-in user menu button “MarvelsGrantMan136” is present, suggesting upvoting should be permitted.
- Current issue: With sorting on “Hot,” the top item is not guaranteed to be the newest; the goal requires switching to “New” before upvoting.
