- Relevant interactive elements to proceed:
  - Left navigation link “My Orders” (marker [1451]) — visible and clickable; leads to complete order history.
  - “Recent Orders” section (marker [1476]) — visible table listing recent orders with per-row:
    - “View Order” links (markers [1487], [1489], [1491], [1493], [1495]) — visible and clickable; open order details where item names (e.g., “bread olive”) and order dates can be verified.

The user asks for the date of their most recent order that includes “bread olive.” I’m on the “My Orders” page, which lists orders in descending order by date, each with a “View Order” link to see line items. We already checked the two most recent orders (#000000197 and #000000196, both dated 12/16/25) and they did not include “bread olive.” The next most recent order in the list is #000000195 (also dated 12/16/25). The fastest way forward is to open this order’s detail page to inspect its items for “bread olive.” On the current page, the “View Order” link for #000000195 has bid 1401. I will click that to view the order details.

Goal: Identify the most recent order containing “bread olive.” I’m currently on the “My Orders” page with orders listed newest-first. I’ve already opened and checked orders #000000197, #000000196, #000000195, #000 pipeline: 197 → 193 — none contained “bread olive.” The last attempt to click “My Orders” timed out, but I’m already on the list, so I should proceed to open the next order in sequence.

Next target: Order #000000192 (dated 12/16/25). I need to click its “View Order” link to inspect the line items for “bread olive.” On the page, the “View Order” link for #000000192 corresponds to bid 1434. I will click that now and then, based on the order detail contents, decide whether to report the date or move to the next order.

The user asked for the date of the most recent order that includes “bread olive.” I’m on the My Orders page with a table listing orders and “View Order” links. I’ve already checked orders #000000197 through #000000190, none of which contained “bread olive.” The next order to inspect is #000000189 (dated 5/2/23). The table shows a “View Order” link for #000000189 with bid 1478. To continue the search efficiently, I should open order #000000189 to review its line items for “bread olive.” The last attempted action (clicking bid 1623) timed out and was redundant since I’m already on the My Orders page, so I will proceed by clicking the correct “View Order” link for #000000189.

The user wants the most recent date they ordered “bread olive.” I am currently on the detail page for Order #000000189 (dated May 2, 2023), and the item is a floor lamp, not “bread olive.” I have already checked orders #000000197 through #000000189, none of which included “bread olive.” To continue the search, I need to return to the My Orders list so I can navigate to older orders (likely via pagination) and keep checking until I find an order containing “bread olive.” The left sidebar includes a “My Orders” link (bid 1466), which is the appropriate control to return to the list of orders. I will click that now.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to “My Orders.”
- Systematically opened and checked orders #000000197 through #000000189; none contained the item “bread olive.”
- Returned to the orders list to continue checking older orders.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (“My Orders”) is directly on the critical path to find when “bread olive” was last ordered.
- The Orders table is visible with recent rows and “View Order” actions:
  - Order #000000197 — link “View Order” [1379] (visible, enabled).
  - Order #000000196 — link “View Order” [1390] (visible, enabled).
  - Order #000000195 — link “View Order” [1401] (visible, enabled).
  - Order #000000194 — link “View Order” [1412] (visible, enabled).
- Context: The list shows items “1 to 10 of 45 total” (per the page UI), indicating additional pages of orders. To locate the order containing “bread olive,” older orders (beyond #000000189 already checked) likely need to be accessed via the pagination controls.
- Status: On track; continue opening older orders (next after #000000189) via the list/pagination until an order with “bread olive” is found.
