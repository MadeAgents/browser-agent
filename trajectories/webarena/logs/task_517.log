The user's goal is to add the current product to their wishlist. On the product page, I see a link labeled "Add to Wish List" in the main product section, identified as element [1500]. The user is already logged in (header shows "Welcome, Emma Lopez!" and "Sign Out"), so clicking this should add the item to the wishlist, possibly navigating to the wishlist page or showing a confirmation. The best next step is to click the "Add to Wish List" link.
