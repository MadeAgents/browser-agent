 <think>
The user wants the top 3 search terms. On the current Dashboard page, there is a "Top Search Terms" table listing search terms with their "Uses" counts, sorted by highest uses first. The first three rows show:
1) hollister — Uses 19
2) Joust Bag — Uses 4
3) Antonia Racer Tank — Uses 2
No navigation is needed; I can directly report these. I will send a concise message listing the top three terms and include their use counts for clarity.
