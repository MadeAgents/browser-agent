✅ Current Progress: Repository “bafta_awards_nolan” exists and the project page is open. A README.md is present but still contains the default template content (not yet updated with Nolan’s BAFTA-nominated films).

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward the goal since it’s the project overview for “bafta_awards_nolan.” Relevant interactive elements:
- Sidebar link “Repository” [301] — visible/enabled; use this to access and edit files.
- Project link “bafta_awards_nolan” [277] — visible/enabled; navigates to the project overview (current page).
- Alerts about SSH keys [575–593] — visible but not blocking web-based edits.
The file list in the main area shows README.md (visible/clickable per screenshot), which needs editing to include Christopher Nolan’s BAFTA-nominated movies.

The repository bafta_awards_nolan is open in the GitLab Web IDE, and README.md has been updated with the list of Christopher Nolan’s BAFTA-nominated films. I need to commit these changes to the main branch per the task tips. In the commit panel, the “Create a new branch” radio is currently selected, while “Commit to main branch” is unchecked. My last attempt to click the radio input [2733] timed out because the adjacent label [2734] intercepted pointer events. To successfully switch the selection, I should click the label [2734] associated with “Commit to main branch,” which will toggle the radio selection. After this, I can commit in the following step.
