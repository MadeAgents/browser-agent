🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to cancel order 307. However, the active filter is set to “ID: 302,” which is not the target. Relevant interactive elements:
- button “Filters” [845] — visible and clickable.
- Active filters list shows “ID: 302” with a remove button [854] and a “Clear all” button [857] — both visible and clickable.
- textbox “Search by keyword” [840] — visible and empty; paired with button “Search” [841].
- table row shows ID “000000302” [1414]; Status column indicates “Canceled.”
- button “Actions” [1070] — visible, but not directly needed for locating 307.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click “Clear all” [857] to remove the incorrect ID filter.
- Click “Filters” [845] to open the filter panel and set the “ID” filter to 307, then apply the filter.

The goal is to cancel order 307. I’m currently on the Orders grid page in Magento Admin, and the Filters panel is open.

The user’s goal is to cancel order 307. I am currently on the order view page for “#000000307,” confirmed by the heading and the “Order Status: Pending.” On this page, the toolbar shows the “Cancel” button [736], which is the correct control to initiate cancellation of a pending order in Magento. To accomplish the task, the next step is to click the “Cancel” button. If a confirmation appears afterward, I’ll handle it in a subsequent step, but the immediate required action is to click “Cancel.”
