 <think>
The user wants to check the most recent open issues for the current project. We're on the "Primer / design" project page. In the left project navigation, there is an "Issues" link specific to this project with a count of 21 (node [330]). To view the issues list and then potentially sort/filter for the most recent open ones, the first step is to navigate to the project's Issues page by clicking that link. This is more precise than using the top navbar "Issues" which could show global issues. After landing on the Issues page, I can look for filters/tabs for "Open" and sort options; but for now, the single best next action is to click the project Issues link.

The user wants to check the most recent open issues for the “Primer / design” project. We’re already on the project’s Issues page with the “Open 21” tab selected, showing the open issues list. To surface the “most recent” ones, I should adjust the sort so that the list is ordered by “Created date” in descending order (newest first). I see a sorting control labeled “Updated date” [623] with a dropdown and the direction control set to “Sort direction: Descending” [679]. The next best step is to open the sort criterion menu by clicking the “Updated date” button so I can switch it to “Created date”.

The user wants to check the most recent open issues in the current project. We’re already on the project’s Issues page with the “Open 21” tab selected.
