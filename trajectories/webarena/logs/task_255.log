The user asks: "Who is the operator of PIT airport." PIT refers to Pittsburgh International Airport. I need to use the current OpenStreetMap website to find the operator. The search bar is visible and focused (element [162] Search). The most efficient way is to search for "Pittsburgh International Airport" because that’s the full name of PIT. After entering the search term, I will click Go to get results and then select the airport entry to view its details, where the operator field is typically listed under Details or All Tags. Since I can only perform one action at a time, the next best action is to fill the search input with "Pittsburgh International Airport".

✅ Current Progress: Entered the query “Pittsburgh International Airport” into the site’s Search field.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap’s homepage and is relevant for finding metadata (including operator) for PIT. Key elements:
- Input: textbox labeled “Search” (id/index [162]), value set to “Pittsburgh International Airport”, focused, visible.
- Action: button “Go” (id/index [165]), visible and clickable; this should execute the search.
- Other map controls (e.g., “Query features” [454]) are present but not needed yet.

The next necessary step on the critical path is to trigger the search via the “Go” button to reach the airport’s details page where the operator can be read.

The user wants to know the operator of PIT (Pittsburgh International Airport). We're on OpenStreetMap, and the search box is already filled with “Pittsburgh International Airport” (element [162]).
