The user wants the page for the Pennsylvania site where a plane crashed during the September 11 attacks. This refers to the United Airlines Flight 93 crash site, which is now the Flight 93 National Memorial near Shanksville, PA. On the current OpenStreetMap page, the search textbox (bid 162) is already focused. The most efficient next step is to use the built-in search rather than navigating manually. I will enter a precise query like "Flight 93 National Memorial, Pennsylvania" to find the correct location, and then in the following step I will click the Go button to execute the search.
