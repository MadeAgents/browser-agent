The user wants me to edit their post about Ted Lasso by adding a specific line to the body. I need to locate that post first. On the current homepage, I see multiple submissions with "Edit" links, but none mention Ted Lasso. The most efficient way to find the relevant post is to use the search functionality instead of scrolling through many posts. There is a search box labeled "Search query" identified as element [55] in the accessibility tree and highlighted in the screenshot. I will enter "Ted Lasso" into the search box to locate the specific submission.

✅ Current Progress: Entered the search term “Ted Lasso” into the site’s search field.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the general “Submissions” list, which is on the path but not yet filtered to the specific Ted Lasso post. The key interactive element is the searchbox labeled “Search query” (id [55]), which is visible, enabled, focused, and currently filled with “Ted Lasso.” Multiple posts on the page show visible, clickable “Edit” links (e.g., [177], [221], [265]) indicating the pattern to use once the correct Ted Lasso post is located. To proceed toward the goal, the search needs to be executed (e.g., by submitting the query in [55]) to find the Ted Lasso submission, then use its “Edit” link to modify the body.

The user wants me to edit their post about “Ted Lasso” and add a specific line to the body. I’m currently on the Postmill homepage with a search box that already contains the query “Ted Lasso” and is focused (element [55]). To locate the specific post efficiently, I should execute the search. Since there’s no visible search button and the search field is focused, pressing Enter should submit the search and navigate to results filtered for “Ted Lasso.” After results load, I’ll look for the relevant post’s “Edit” link to proceed to the edit form, where I can append the specified line to the body.

The user wants to edit their post about Ted Lasso and append a specific line to the body. I'm currently on the search results page for "Ted Lasso". I need to locate the user's own post. Scanning the accessibility tree, I find an article with the heading "‘TedLasso’ Season 3 Premiere Scores 870K U.S. Households, Up 59% From Season 2 Premiere" that shows "Submitted by MarvelsGrantMan136", which matches the user's account. Within this article's navigation list, there is a direct "Edit" link (element [316]), which is the correct control to access the edit form. According to the site tips, to view post details we should click "comments", but for editing, using the "Edit" link is appropriate and more direct.
