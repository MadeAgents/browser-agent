The user's goal is to create a repository named "live_a_life" that contains a README with links to the most active 3 DIY ideas on the DIY subreddit. On the current GitLab dashboard page, I can already see an existing repository "Byte Blaze / live_a_life" (updated 3 days ago). Since the repository exists, the next logical step is to open it to add or edit a README file with the required links. After opening the repo, I can check if a README exists and, if not, create one. If it does exist, I can edit it. The search and retrieval of the “most active 3 DIY ideas” will require navigating to the provided forum site later, but first I should enter the repository. So, I will click the "Byte Blaze / live_a_life" link to open the repository.

✅ Current Progress: The repository “live_a_life” exists and is open on GitLab. The README has not been updated to include links to the top 3 active DIY subreddit ideas yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward the goal since it’s the project’s repository view where the README can be edited. Relevant interactive elements:
- Navigation link “Repository” (node [301]) — visible and enabled; leads to the file list where README.md can be accessed.
- Breadcrumb “live_a_life” (node [605]) — visible; confirms we’re in the correct project.
- Sidebar project navigation link “live_a_life” (node [277]) — visible; keeps context within this project.
- “Create new...” (node [160]) — visible but not required for editing the README.
From the screenshot, the file list shows a “README.md” entry (clickable in the main content), which is the correct file to edit for adding the required links.

Navigating to the forum will require opening it, ideally in a new tab so I can return to GitLab easily afterward without losing context.

✅ Current Progress: Repository “live_a_life” exists. A new browser tab has been opened to gather links, but no navigation to the DIY subreddit has occurred yet. README has not been updated.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current tab shows a blank page. The accessibility tree contains only RootWebArea with no interactive elements, indicating the page is not on the critical path toward the goal. To proceed, the agent needs to navigate to the DIY subreddit to identify the top 3 active ideas and collect their links. Relevant interactive elements: none visible/enabled on this page.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Navigate the current tab to the DIY subreddit to collect links: open_url("https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/?sort=hot").

The user wants a GitLab repository README listing links to the most active 3 DIY ideas from the DIY forum (subreddit). I’m currently on the DIY forum page (Tab 1) showing posts with comment counts and upvotes, sorted by Hot. To define "most active," comment count is a strong proxy. Among project-style posts (DIY ideas), the top visible by comments are:
- "I made a honeycomb firewood rack" — 206 comments
- "I made a makeup table for my girlfriend's birthday out of an old bar cabinet" — 173 comments
- "Old disgusting bathroom gets a makeover (reupload)" — 168 comments

To capture accurate links, I should open the post’s internal comment page rather than the title (per Reddit Task Tips, clicking title may redirect to external sites like imgur). I’ll start by opening the "206 comments" link for "I made a honeycomb firewood rack," which is the most active project post. Once on its comments page, I can note the URL for later inclusion in the README. Then I'll proceed similarly for the next two posts and finally return to GitLab to update README.md.

Immediate next step: click the "206 comments" link for the honeycomb firewood rack post.

The user's goal is to create/update the README in the "live_a_life" GitLab repository with links to the most active 3 DIY ideas from the DIY forum. I’m on the DIY forum listing page (Tab 1). To determine "most active," I will use the comment count as the activity proxy, focusing on project-style posts. The likely top three are: "I made a honeycomb firewood rack" (206 comments), "I made a makeup table..." (173 comments), and "Old disgusting bathroom gets a makeover" (168 comments). I already opened the honeycomb post’s comments earlier but didn’t capture its Short URL. To gather the Short URLs for each, I should open their internal “comments” pages (per Reddit Task Tips) rather than external title links. The next step is to click the "173 comments" link (bid 200) for the makeup table post to access its comments page and retrieve the Short URL.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened the GitLab repository “live_a_life”.
- Navigated to the forum site, entered the DIY forum, and opened two high-activity posts’ comments pages:
  - “I made a honeycomb firewood rack” (previously opened).
  - “I made a makeup table for my girlfriend's birthday out of an old bar cabinet” (current page).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is the comments page for the DIY post “I made a makeup table for my girlfriend's birthday out of an old bar cabinet”, which is directly relevant for collecting a link to include in the README.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link “/f/DIY” (id [120]) — visible/enabled; returns to the DIY forum listing to open other top posts.
  - Link “imgur.com” (id [132]) — external; not needed for the submission’s internal link.
  - Link “173 comments” (id [146]) — visible; denotes the thread, but the page is already the comments view.
  - Comment textbox “Comment” (id [173], required) and button “Post” (id [313]) — visible/enabled; not needed for the task.
  - Upvote/Downvote buttons (ids [151], [161]) — visible; not needed for the task.
- This page is on the critical path: capturing this page’s URL and then returning to the DIY forum to open the third high-activity post (e.g., “Old disgusting bathroom gets a makeover”) will complete the link collection before updating the README in the repository. No deviations detected.

The task is to create/update the README in the GitLab repository "live_a_life" with links to the most active 3 DIY ideas from the DIY forum. I already identified likely top posts by comment count and currently have the comments page for one of them (“I made a makeup table…”). This page shows a Short URL ("http://10.177.37.113:9999/76184") in the right sidebar, which is the internal link we need to include. To avoid losing this information when I navigate away to gather the other two links, I should save it using the take_note action. After that, I will go back to the DIY forum (/f/DIY) and open the other two high-activity posts' comments pages to record their Short URLs, then return to GitLab (Tab 0) to update README.md with all three links.
