We are on the "My Account" dashboard, where the Address Book section is visible, showing separate default billing and shipping addresses, each with an "Edit Address" link. There is also a "Manage Addresses" link which likely centralizes address editing for both billing and shipping. To efficiently update both addresses, the best next step is to click "Manage Addresses" to access the address management page and then perform edits.

 <think>
The user asked to update their address to "111 Magnolia Path, Atlanta, GA, 30303". We are on the "Edit Address" page where the fields currently show:
- Street Address Line 1: "111 Magnolia Path"
- Street Address Line 2: "House #3" (unchanged, but not specified to modify)
- Country: "United States"
- State/Province: "Georgia"
- City: "Atlanta"
- Zip/Postal Code: "30303"

The form indicates "It's a default billing address." and "It's a default shipping address.", meaning this address is used for both. All required fields now match the new address. The next logical step is to save the changes by clicking the "Save Address" button (bid 1754). This should apply the update across the account's default addresses. Since only one action is allowed, I will click the Save button now.
