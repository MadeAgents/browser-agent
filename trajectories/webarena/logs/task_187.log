🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is the Dashboard, not yet the Products grid where inventory quantities and SKUs can be filtered and read. This is still on the critical path toward the goal, as the necessary navigation is exposed.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link “Products” [201] — visible and enabled; this should navigate to the products grid (needed to filter by quantity).
  - Link “Categories” [204] — visible and enabled; not relevant to the goal.
  - Button “Reload Data” [714] — visible; unrelated to the goal.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the Magento Admin “Products” grid. A quantity filter is applied for 2–3 units, and the grid shows “2 records found.” SKUs have not yet been captured. The filter range does not fully match the goal (should be 1–3).

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal; it displays the products list with quantity and SKU columns.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Button “Filters” [890] — visible and enabled; needed to adjust the quantity range.
  - Active filters list shows “Quantity: 2 - 3” with remove button [899] and “Clear all” [902] — both visible and enabled.
  - Table with column headers including “SKU” [1759] and “Quantity” [1763]; 2 result rows are present under rowgroup [1779].
- To meet the goal precisely, the quantity filter should be From=1 To=3, then read the SKU values from the SKU column cells of the resulting rows.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button “Filters” [890] to open the filters panel and change the Quantity “From” to 1 before applying the filters.
