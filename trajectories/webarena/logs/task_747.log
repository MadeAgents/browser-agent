The user wants to start a new private project named "awesome_web_agents" using a blank template and then add two members, Abishek and Vinta. I am currently on the Projects dashboard of GitLab. To create a new project, the typical path is to click the "New project" button on this page. The accessibility tree shows a link labeled "New project" with bid [252] near the Projects header. Clicking this should take me to the new project creation flow where I can choose "Create blank project," set the project name, and choose visibility to Private. After the project is created, I will navigate to Project information > Members and invite Abishek and Vinta. For now, the next best step is to click "New project" to start the creation process.

The user wants a new private project named "awesome_web_agents" using a blank template and then to add members Abishek and Vinta. We're already on the "Create blank project" form.

After creation, navigate to Project information > Members to invite Abishek and Vinta.

  - textbox “Search GitLab” (id: 116) — empty, enabled.
- The errors imply the project/path already exists in the current namespace. To progress toward adding members, either open the existing project or choose a different namespace before creating.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Type “awesome_web_agents” into the textbox labeled “Search GitLab” (id: 116) and submit the search to locate the existing project, then proceed to its Members page to add users.
- Alternatively, click the “Pick a group or namespace” button (id: 284) to select a different namespace, then click “Create project” (id: 357).

To proceed toward the goal (adding members), I should locate the existing project and manage its members.

The user’s goal is to add members Abishek and Vinta to the existing private project "awesome_web_agents". I’m currently on the project’s Members page and the "Invite members" modal is open. The modal contains a textbox labeled "Username or email address" (bid 854) which is focused. To proceed, I should enter the first member's identifier so that suggestions can appear or the entry can be tokenized. Since only one action is allowed at a time, the best next step is to fill the textbox with "Abishek". After this, I will likely need to either select the suggested user or press Enter to confirm, then repeat for "Vinta" and finally click Invite.
