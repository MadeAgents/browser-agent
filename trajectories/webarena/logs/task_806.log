The task is to create a merge request merging the redesign branch into the markdown-figure-block branch and assign myself (byteblaze) as the reviewer. I am on the project page for a11yproject.com, which shows the project navigation in the left sidebar. The appropriate next step is to navigate to the project’s Merge requests section where I can create a new MR. In the accessibility tree, the project navigation includes a "Merge requests" link with bid [356]. Clicking this should take me to the MR page, where I expect to find a "New merge request" button or similar to start the creation flow. From there, I can select the source and target branches and set the reviewer. Given the constraints (no scrolling and we should prefer direct navigation links), clicking the sidebar "Merge requests" link is the most direct path.

The goal is to create a merge request with source branch "redesign" and target branch "markdown-figure-block", then assign myself (Byte Blaze) as the reviewer and submit it. I'm on the "New merge request" page where the source branch isn't selected yet and the target branch is currently "main". The next logical step is to set the source branch. The page shows a "Select source branch" button [632] under the "Source branch" section. Clicking this should open a branch selection UI where I can choose "redesign". After that, I’ll change the target branch to "markdown-figure-block" and proceed to the comparison step to reach the form where I can assign the reviewer. Since only one action is allowed per step, I will start by clicking "Select source branch".

The goal is to submit a merge request from source branch "redesign" into target branch "feature/markdown-figure-block" and assign myself (Byte Blaze) as the reviewer. On the "New merge request" page, the source branch is already set to "redesign" and the target branch is set to "feature/markdown-figure-block". To proceed to the form where I can set reviewers and submit the MR, I should click the "Compare branches and continue" button. This will open the merge request creation form with title/description fields and reviewer selection. The next steps after this will be to assign myself as reviewer and submit the MR.

The header confirms "Byte Blaze requested to merge redesign into feature/markdown-figure-block just now," which matches the target branch ("markdown-figure-block") with its full name including the "feature/" prefix. The sidebar’s Reviewer section shows Byte Blaze selected, and the Activity feed states "requested review from @byteblaze," confirming reviewer assignment. The MR status is "Open." Therefore, the merge request has been successfully created and reviewer assigned.
