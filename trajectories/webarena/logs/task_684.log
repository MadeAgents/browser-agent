The user wants me to create a new submission promoting the repository byteblaze/cloud-to-butt to the LifeProTips forum (subreddit). On Postmill, creating a submission starts by clicking the "Submit" link in the top navigation. I will need the repo’s description to include in the Body field exactly as worded in the repository. I can gather that later via the GitLab site using the provided search tip, but first I should open the submission form. On the current page, the "Submit" link is listed in the navigation area with accessibility node [63]. Clicking it should open the submission form where I can select the forum (LifeProTips), and then I can switch to another tab to retrieve the exact repo description before filling the form. Therefore, the next best action is to click the "Submit" link.

The user wants me to create a submission promoting the repository "byteblaze/cloud-to-butt" to the LifeProTips forum, using the repo’s own description in the post body. I’m currently on the “Create submission” page with fields for URL, Title (required), Body (Markdown allowed), and Forum (required). To accurately include the repo’s description, I need to retrieve it from the repo first. Based on the GitLab tips, I should use the GitLab instance search URL instead of the global search bar. Since I need to preserve the submission form while I look up the description, the best next step is to open a new tab where I can navigate to the GitLab search page to find "cloud-to-butt" and get the exact description. Then I will return to this tab to fill Title, Body (including the description and URL per the Reddit-form tip to put URLs in Body), select the forum "LifeProTips," and submit.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Switch back to the previous tab that contains the “Create submission” form to continue filling the URL, Title, Body (use the repo’s own description), select the “LifeProTips” forum, and submit.
- If the intent was to retrieve the repo description first, load the repository page in this tab by entering its URL in the browser’s address bar, then copy the description before returning to the submission form.

The objective is to submit a post to the LifeProTips forum using the repository’s own description and include the repo URL in the body. I’m on the Create submission page where:
- Title is already filled with a suitable LifeProTip.
- Body is empty and should contain the repo description and URL (as per Reddit task tips to put URLs in Body and leave the URL field empty).
- Forum is still set to “Choose one…”, which I’ll select after filling the body.

From Tab 1, the repo description is: "Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'the cloud' with 'my butt'". The repo URL is http://10.177.37.113:8023/byteblaze/cloud-to-butt. I will now fill the Body field [142] with the exact description followed by the URL on a new line. After this, I’ll select the forum and submit.

The user’s goal is to post a submission to the LifeProTips forum using the repo’s description. On the Create submission page, I’ve already filled the Title and Body correctly with the description and the repo URL. The remaining required step is to select the forum. The “Forum” field is a combobox labeled “Choose one…” (element [383]). To select “LifeProTips,” I need to first expand the combobox so the options become visible, then choose the correct forum. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best action is to click the combobox to expand it.
