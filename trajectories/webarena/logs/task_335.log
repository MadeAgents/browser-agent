The user wants to know the most recent date they ordered “body butter.” To determine this, I need to review their order history and identify the latest order that includes an item named “body butter.” On the current My Account dashboard, there’s a left sidebar with the link “My Orders” (bid 1541). This should lead to a full order history view where I can either scan recent orders or use any available filters to locate orders containing body butter. While the “Recent Orders” table shows the latest five, the item might not be among those, so going to “My Orders” is the safest next step. I will click the “My Orders” link.

The user wants to know the most recent date they ordered “body butter.” I’m currently on the “My Orders” page with a table of orders.

- Opened the most recent order detail page: Order #000000197.
- Verified the item list; it contains “Atlantic Technology FS-7.0-GLB 7-channel Surround Bar …” — not body butter.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (“Order # 000000197”) is on the critical path, as it allows checking items per order.
- Key elements:
  - Heading “Order # 000000197” [1355]; Status “Pending”; “Order Date: December 16, 2025”.
  - Items Ordered table [1374] shows the single product listed above (no body butter).
  - Links: “Reorder” [1363] (visible), “Print Order” [1365] (visible) — not needed for the goal.
  - Global nav link “My Account” [220] (visible) can be used to return to account pages to access the orders list for checking earlier orders.
- Next step toward the goal is to return to the orders list and open the next most recent order (e.g., #000000196) to continue searching for “body butter.”

The goal is to find the most recent date when the user ordered body butter. I’m currently on the “My Orders” page with a table of orders sorted by most recent first. I have already checked the two most recent orders (#000000197 and #000000196) and confirmed they do not include body butter. The next logical step is to open the next most recent order, #000000195 (dated 12/16/25), by clicking its “View Order” link to check the items list for any mention of “body butter.” This aligns with an efficient reverse-chronological search through order details until I find the relevant item.

The user asks for the most recent date they ordered body butter. I’m on the My Orders page with the orders table visible. I have already checked the most recent orders (#000000197 through #000000190, all on 12/16/25) and none contained body butter. The next orders visible are #000000170 (dated 5/17/23, Canceled) and #000000189 (dated 5/2/23, Pending). To continue searching in reverse chronological order, I should open the next earlier order and inspect its items. I will start with Order #000000170 by clicking its “View Order” link (bid 1467) to check whether it includes body butter. If not, I will return and check #000000189 next.

The user asks for the most recent date they ordered body butter. I need to review order history and find an order containing “body butter.” I’m currently on an order detail page: “Order # 000000170” (Canceled, May 17, 2023). The Items Ordered list shows a lamp, a coat rack, and lingerie—none is body butter. Therefore, I should go back to the My Orders list to continue checking orders in reverse chronological order (next candidates include #000000189 and others). On the left sidebar under “My Account,” there is a “My Orders” link (bid 1507). Clicking this will return me to the orders list so I can open other orders to search for body butter.
