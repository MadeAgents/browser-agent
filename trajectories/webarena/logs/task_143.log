The user wants to know the amount spent on home decoration shopping on 1/29/2023. To find this, I should navigate to their order history. The task tips indicate the correct path is My Account > My Orders. From there, I can locate orders by date and identify items under a home decoration category (likely a subcategory like Home Decor under Home & Kitchen). The current page is the site homepage and shows a "My Account" link in the top banner (accessibility node [227]).

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “My Account” dashboard.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal, as order history is typically accessed from the account area. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link “My Orders” (left sidebar navigation): visible and enabled; essential for accessing the full order history to locate purchases from 01/29/2023.
- Section “Recent Orders” with multiple “View Order” links under the Action column: visible and enabled; current displayed order dates appear to be recent (e.g., 12/16/25) and do not include 01/29/2023, so this section likely won’t cover the target date.
- Other links like “Manage Addresses”, “Edit Address”, “Change Password”, and “View All” (reviews) are unrelated to the goal.

The user wants the total spent on home decoration shopping on 1/29/2023. To find this, I need to access the full order history and locate orders from that date, then inspect the items to determine if they are in the "home decoration" category and sum the amounts. On the current "My Account" page, the left sidebar contains a "My Orders" link (bid 1541), which is the correct navigation path per the task tips. The "Recent Orders" table shows only December 2025 entries, so it won’t include January 2023.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to the goal (finding spend on 01/29/2023). The Orders table is visible with columns:

- Current rows show dates 12/16/25 (e.g., order 000000197 [1373] with total $15.27 [1375]; order 000000196 [1384] with $29.99 [1386]; order 000000195 [1395] with $55.06 [1397]).
Relevant interactive elements to progress:
- “View Order” links in the Action column: [1379], [1390], [1401] — visible and enabled (used to open order details).
- “Reorder” links [1381], [1392], [1403] — visible and enabled but not relevant to the goal.
- Search button [272] — disabled; unrelated.
The target date (01/29/2023) is not visible in the current page of results, so older orders must be accessed (likely via pagination or filters not shown in the provided axtree).

I’m on the My Orders page, page 2 (items 11–20), and I can see a row with Date = 1/29/23, Order # 000000148, Total $440.64, Status Complete. To determine the amount specifically for “home decoration,” I need to open this order’s details to inspect the line items and identify which belong to the Home Decoration category. The Action column for this row includes a “View Order” link with bid 1467. Clicking it should load the order details page where I can review item categories and prices to compute the spend on home decoration for that date.

The user wants the amount spent specifically on home decoration on 1/29/2023 and the instruction requires returning just the decimal. I'm on the order detail page for Order #000000148 dated January 29, 2023. The "Items Ordered" table shows two products:
- Bornbridge Artificial Spiral Topiary Tree (2 Pack) at $260.69 — this is a home decoration item.
- Russound 4" Indoor Outdoor Speakers at $169.95 — this is electronics, not home decoration.

No other home decoration items are listed. Therefore, the total spent on home decoration on that date is the price of the topiary tree: $260.69. Per the benchmark rule, I must return only the decimal without the dollar sign.
