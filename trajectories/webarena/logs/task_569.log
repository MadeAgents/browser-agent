🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path for inviting collaborators. The project is marked Private, indicating access must be explicitly granted. Relevant interactive elements to proceed:
- Sidebar link “Project information” (id: [282]) — visible and enabled. Typically leads to the “Members” section where invitations can be sent.
- Sidebar link “Settings” (id: [515]) — visible and enabled. In some GitLab setups, “Members” is accessible here as well.

The goal is to invite Benoît and Abishek as collaborators to the current repository. According to the provided Task Tips, the correct path in GitLab is: Project information > Members > Invite members. On the current project page “accessible-html-content-patterns,” the left sidebar includes a "Project information" link (bid 282). Clicking this should either open the project information overview or expand a submenu where "Members" is available.

The user wants to invite two people (Benoît and Abishek) as collaborators to the current GitLab repo. I’m already on the Project members page and the “Invite members” modal is open. The modal includes:

- A role selector defaulted to Guest (bid 865) which I’ll later change to Developer to match “collaborator.”
- An Invite button.

To proceed logically, I should start by entering the first user’s name into the invite field to trigger the suggestion list so I can select the correct account. Since only one action is allowed per step, I will type “Benoît” into the focused username/email field now. After that, I will select the suggestion if it appears, add Abishek similarly, set role to Developer, and then click Invite.

The most effective next step is to type “Abishek” into this field to bring up matching user suggestions, after which I can select the correct suggestion in a subsequent step, then set the role to Developer and click Invite.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the Project members page and opened the “Invite members” modal.
- Added “Benoît” as a selected recipient in the “Username or email address” field.
- Typed “Abishek” into the same field; his suggestion appears but has not been selected yet.
- Role remains at default “Guest”; invitation not sent.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The “Invite members” modal on the Project members page is directly on the critical path to inviting collaborators.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Textbox “Username or email address” (id 854): contains one token for “Benoît”; currently filled with “Abishek” and showing a suggestion (e.g., “Abishek S abisubramanya27”); enabled and focused.
  - Role dropdown “Select a role” (id 865): currently set to “Guest”; enabled; should be changed to a collaborator-appropriate level (e.g., “Developer”).
  - Textbox “Access expiration date (optional)” (id 872): empty; enabled.
  - Button “Invite” (id 886): visible and enabled.
  - Button “Cancel” (id 884): visible and enabled.
- No deviation detected; the current page and modal are appropriate for completing the goal.

The goal is to invite two collaborators, Benoît and Abishek, to the repository. I'm already on the Project members page with the "Invite members" modal open. The listbox shows a token for "Benoît Blanchon," indicating Benoît is already added. The textbox currently has "Abishek" typed, and a suggestions menu is visible with "Abishek S abisubramanya27" (menuitem bid 1128). The next step is to select this suggestion so Abishek is added as a recipient. After selecting, I will change the role to Developer (since "collaborator" typically maps to Developer in GitLab) and then click Invite. For now, the optimal single action is to click the suggestion for Abishek.

The user’s goal is to invite Benoît and Abishek as collaborators to the repository. I’m on the Project members page with the “Invite members” modal open. The Username/email field already contains tokens for “Benoît Blanchon” and “Abishek S,” confirming both invitees are selected. The role combobox (id 865) is focused and currently set to “Reporter” (as shown in the accessibility tree: value='Reporter', expanded=False). Since the combobox is collapsed, clicking an option may not work. Previously, pressing ArrowDown successfully changed the role from Guest to Reporter. To set it to Developer (which matches “collaborator”), pressing ArrowDown once more should move from Reporter to Developer. After that, I will be able to click Invite in the next step.

The task is to invite Benoît and Abishek as collaborators to the current GitLab repository. I'm on the Project members page for "accessible-html-content-patterns," and the "Invite members" modal is open. The "Username or email address" field already contains tokens for "Benoît Blanchon" and "Abishek S," confirming both invitees are selected. The role combobox is set to "Developer," which aligns with "collaborator." The access expiration date is optional and can be left empty. The next logical step to complete the invitation is to click the "Invite" button in the modal.
