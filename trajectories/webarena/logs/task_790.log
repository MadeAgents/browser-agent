The user's goal is to delete all negative reviews for the product "Sybil running short". On Magento, reviews are managed under the Marketing section, specifically User Content > All Reviews, as per the provided tips. From the current Dashboard page, I should navigate to MARKETING to access the reviews management UI. Once there, I will look for "User Content" and then "All Reviews", filter by product name "Sybil running short", identify negative reviews (likely low ratings like 1–2 stars), select them, and use the delete action. The first step is to click the MARKETING link in the top navigation to get to that section.

- Table columns include “Product” (columnheader id=799) with a filter textbox in the header row (currently empty), suitable for narrowing to “Sybil running short”.
- Column “Action” (columnheader id=803) shows per-row “Edit” links in the screenshot, useful for inspecting individual reviews if needed.
- Grid status shows “345 records found”; pagination indicates page 1 of 18 (textbox id=771), “per page” combobox (id=761) set to 20.

No errors or off-track indicators detected; the next step will be to filter the Product column to “Sybil running short” and then select and delete the negative reviews.

The user wants to delete all negative reviews for the product "Sybil running short." I am on the Magento Admin Reviews grid, which supports filtering by product name using the filter row under the "Product" column. The filter row includes a textbox corresponding to the "Product" column (bid 851). The optimal next step is to filter the grid to only show reviews for "Sybil Running Short" by entering the product name into that textbox. After filtering, I can identify negative reviews and proceed to select and delete them via the Actions menu, but since only one action is allowed per step, I will first input the product name into the Product filter textbox to narrow the results. Then in a subsequent step, I will click Search to apply the filter.

The user asked to delete all negative reviews for “Sybil running short.” I’m on the Magento Admin Reviews grid already filtered to the product “Sybil Running Short,” and the table shows “3 records found.” Reviewing the rows: all three reviews (IDs 301, 302, 303) have Status “Approved” and their titles/content snippets are clearly positive (e.g., “Want these in every single color…”, “These are really well made and so lightweight…”, “I couldn’t live without these…”). The grid does not display star ratings, but the content and approval status indicate no negative reviews are present. Since there are none to delete, the correct next step is to inform the user that no negative reviews exist for this product and ask if they'd like further actions.
