The user wants me to notify Sarah Miller on her most recent pending order with the specific message. To accomplish this in Magento Admin, I should navigate to Sales > Orders to view the order grid, filter to Pending status, sort by Purchase Date descending (as per the benchmark requirement), find Sarah Miller’s latest pending order, open it, and add a comment with “Notify Customer” checked. Starting from the Dashboard, the quickest path is to click the SALES menu item to access the orders list.

The expanded Sales menu shows the “Orders” link (id/index: [168], visible, clickable), which is the relevant entry point to locate pending orders. Other menu items like “Invoices” [171] and “Shipments” [174] are present but not necessary for this task. The dashboard content (e.g., “Reload Data” button [732]) is unrelated to the goal. Accessing “Orders” is required to find Sarah Miller’s most recent pending order and add the notification message.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to Sales > Orders. The orders grid is loaded but currently filtered by keyword “000000301”, showing 1 record that is canceled and not for Sarah Miller.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to the goal (finding Sarah Miller’s most recent pending order and notifying her). Key elements:
- textbox “Search by keyword” [858], filled with “000000301” (visible, editable).
- button “Search” [859] (visible, enabled).
- button “Filters” [863] (visible, enabled).
- button “Clear all” [875] (visible, enabled) under “Active filters”.
- table columns including “Purchase Date” [1404] and “Status” [1414] (visible). Current row shows Bill-to/Ship-to “Alex Johnson” and Status “Canceled”, which is irrelevant to the goal.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button “Clear all” [875] to remove the active keyword filter.
- Type “Sarah Miller” into textbox “Search by keyword” [858] and click button “Search” [859] to locate her orders.

- Cleared prior filters, opened Filters, set Status to “Pending,” and applied it; the grid shows “3 records found.”

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path to the goal (identify Sarah Miller’s most recent pending order and notify).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Active filter: “Status: Pending” in list [868]; can be removed via button [8775] “\ue620”.
  - Column header “↓ Purchase Date” [1404]: visible, clickable; currently sorted descending (↓).
  - Filters for narrowing to Sarah Miller:
    - textbox “Bill-to Name” [980]: visible, enabled, empty.
    - textbox “Ship-to Name” [985]: visible, enabled, empty.
    - textbox “Search by keyword” [858]: visible, enabled, empty; button “Search” [859] is enabled to apply these inputs.
  - Grid shows “3 records found” (StaticText), suggesting the list is already limited to pending orders.

The task is to notify Sarah Miller in her most recent pending order with the message "the order is ready to be shipped soon!". I’m currently on the Sales > Orders grid, with the Status filter set to Pending and the grid sorted by Purchase Date in descending order, satisfying the benchmark requirement to sort recent orders by Purchase Date. The visible pending orders list shows names like Lily Potter and Grace Nguyen, but not Sarah Miller, so I need to narrow results to Sarah Miller.

The quickest way is to use the “Search by keyword” textbox to search for “Sarah Miller” while the Pending filter remains active, which should yield pending orders for Sarah Miller. After the search, I can open the most recent matching order and add the customer notification comment. Since only one action is allowed per step, I’ll enter “Sarah Miller” into the keyword search field [858] before clicking Search in a subsequent step.

The goal is to notify Sarah Miller in her most recent pending order with the specified message. I’m on Sales > Orders with Status filtered to Pending, and I have already sorted by Purchase Date in descending order, which satisfies the requirement to sort recent orders. I’ve entered “Sarah Miller” into the “Search by keyword” textbox, but the filter hasn’t been applied yet. To narrow the grid to Sarah Miller’s pending orders, I need to click the “Search” button. Once the results load, the grid will remain sorted by Purchase Date descending, so the top row will be her most recent pending order. I can then click “View” on that row, and on the order page, add the comment with “Notify Customer” checked. The best next step now is to apply the search filter by clicking the Search button.

- Sorted by “Purchase Date” in descending order.
- Applied keyword search for “Sarah Miller.”

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path to the goal (Orders grid).
- Active filters show:
  - “Keyword: Sarah Miller” with remove button [8803] (visible).
  - “Status: Pending” with remove button [8775] (visible).
- The grid reports “0 records found,” so no matching pending orders for “Sarah Miller” are currently displayed.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - textbox “Search by keyword” [858]: filled with “Sarah Miller,” visible and enabled.
  - button “Search” [859]: visible and enabled.
  - button “Clear all” [875]: visible and enabled.
  - column header “↓ Purchase Date” [1404]: visible and already sorted descending.
- Current state blocks progress because there is no order to open and notify under the active filters.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button [8775] to remove the “Status: Pending” filter and verify if any orders exist for “Sarah Miller.” If results appear, you can then re-apply the Pending filter appropriately.

Goal: Notify Sarah Miller in their most recent pending order with the message "the order is ready to be shipped soon!".

Current state: On Sales > Orders. Active filters show "Keyword: Sarah Miller" and "Status: Pending". The grid shows "0 records found" and a row saying "We couldn't find any records." I have already sorted by Purchase Date descending, meeting the requirement. Since the pending filter combined with the keyword yields no results, I should diagnose whether Sarah Miller has any orders at all by removing the Pending status filter. If orders appear without the pending filter, I can then check if any are pending (and re-apply or adjust filters as needed). If none exist, I may need to conclude infeasibility. The UI provides a remove button for the "Status: Pending" filter [8775]. Clicking it is the best next step to progress.

The goal is to notify Sarah Miller in her most recent pending order with a specific message. I navigated to Sales > Orders, opened Filters, set Status to “Pending,” applied the filter, and sorted by Purchase Date descending to meet the benchmark requirement. I then searched for “Sarah Miller.” The grid showed “0 records found” with Status = Pending and the keyword filter applied, confirming that Sarah Miller has no pending orders. After removing the Pending filter, I can see her historical orders (Complete or Canceled), but none are Pending. Since notifying must occur within a pending order’s comment section, and no such order exists for Sarah Miller, the instruction is infeasible.
