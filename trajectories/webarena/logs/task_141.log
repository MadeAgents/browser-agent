The user wants to know how much they spent on food-related shopping during March 2023. On this e-commerce site, to find spending information, I should navigate to the user's order history. The task tips indicate that order info is under My Account > My Orders. Once there, I can look for orders in March 2023 and identify food-related items (likely those in Grocery & Gourmet Food) and sum their totals. 

Currently, I am on the homepage of "One Stop Market" and see a "My Account" link in the banner (Accessibility Tree node [227]). The first step is to click "My Account" to access account details and order history. I will click the "My Account" link to proceed toward "My Orders".

- Link “My Orders” (marker id 1453 in the left navigation): visible and enabled. This should lead to the full order history.
- Section “Recent Orders” (table shown in the main content; rows dated 12/16/25): includes “View Order” actions (markers around 1480 for each row), visible and enabled, but these entries are not from March 2023.
- Category link “Grocery & Gourmet Food” (id 1118) in the top navigation: visible and enabled, but not relevant for historical spending.

The user asks: "How much I spent on food-related shopping during March 2023." To answer, I need to access the user's order history and identify orders in March 2023, then filter only the food-related items and sum their costs. On this Magento account page, the correct path is My Account > My Orders. I am already on the "My Account" dashboard, and the left sidebar contains a link "My Orders" with bid 1541. Clicking this will likely show the entire order history with filters or pagination, enabling me to locate March 2023 orders. Once there, I can open orders from March 2023, check items and categories (e.g., Grocery & Gourmet Food), and sum up their spending. The next best step is to click the "My Orders" link.

Goal: Determine how much was spent on food-related shopping during March 2023. 
Current page: "My Orders" with a paginated orders table showing the most recent orders first.

✅ Current Progress: 
- Navigated to My Account > My Orders.
- Used pagination to jump to the last page (oldest orders). No March 2023 orders reviewed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- We are on the correct feature (“My Orders”) but on the wrong page for the target timeframe. The visible orders are from 2022 (e.g., 4/27/22, 4/5/22, 3/10/22, 3/2/22), which is earlier than March 2023.
- Relevant elements:
  - Orders table “Orders” (node 1362): visible with Date, Order Total, and Action columns.
  - “View Order” links in each row (e.g., nodes 1379, 1390, 1401): visible and enabled.
  - Pagination control (bottom of the table) shows page links “1 2 3 4 5”; page “5” is currently selected; items shown are “Items 41 to 45 of 45 total.” March 2023 will likely be on page 3 or 4.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the pagination link labeled “4” near the bottom of the Orders table (page selector showing “1 2 3 4 5”) to move to slightly newer orders that may include March 2023.
- If March 2023 orders appear, click the “View Order” link in each row dated in March 2023 (use the Action column link with visible text “View Order”) to inspect items and identify food-related purchases.

The user asked for the total spent on food-related shopping during March 2023. We are on the My Orders page (page 2), which displays multiple orders including two from March 2023:
- Order #000000180 dated 3/11/23 with total $65.32 (Complete)
- Order #000000166 dated 3/10/23 with total $17.99 (Complete)

To determine which portions of these totals are food-related, I need to open each March order and inspect the line items to identify food products (likely in the Grocery & Gourmet Food category) and then sum those amounts. The next step is to click “View Order” for one of the March orders. Starting with the 3/11/23 order (bid 1401) will let me see its contents.

The user wants the total spent on food-related shopping during March 2023. I’m currently viewing the details of Order #000000180 (dated March 11, 2023).

Objective: Calculate total spent on food-related shopping in March 2023. I opened Order #000000180 (3/11/23) and identified a food item (“Jiffy Corn Muffin Cornbread Mix, 40 Ounce Box”) subtotaling $11.43. I now need to review other March 2023 orders (notably #000000166 on 3/10/23 that I saw on the Page 2 list) to find additional food items and sum their amounts.

Issue: I attempted to click a sidebar link (bid 1544), but that was not the correct “My Orders” and timed out. The quickest reliable way back to the orders list (Page 2) is to use the browser's back navigation.

Task: Calculate how much was spent on food-related shopping during March 2023. I’m currently viewing the details for Order #000000180 (dated March 11, 2023), where I identified one food item: “Jiffy Corn Muffin Cornbread Mix, 40 Ounce Box” subtotal $11.43.

I need to navigate back to the My Orders list to open that order and inspect its items.

On the current order detail page, the left sidebar shows a “My Orders” link (bid 1544). Clicking this should take me back to the orders list where I can find and open the 3/10/23 order. Previously, an attempt to click this link timed out and I used the browser back button, but the current screenshot still shows I’m on the order detail page.

The goal is to total food-related spending in March 2023. I already inspected Order #000000180 (March 11, 2023) and found one food item: “Jiffy Corn Muffin Cornbread Mix, 40 Ounce Box” subtotal $11.43. I now need to open the other March 2023 order(s), specifically Order #000000166 (March 10, 2023) seen on the My Orders list, to check for food items and add their amounts.

I attempted twice to use the left sidebar “My Orders” link (bid 1544), but it did not navigate (per prior timeouts). To avoid repeating an ineffective action, I will take a different path: use the header’s “My Account” link (bid 220) to go to the account dashboard, from where I can access My Orders and then open the March 10 order. This should move me closer to completing the calculation.

The goal is to total food-related spending in March 2023. I already inspected Order #000000180 (March 11, 2023) and found one food item: “Jiffy Corn Muffin Cornbread Mix, 40 Ounce Box” subtotal $11.43. I now need to open the other March 2023 order(s), specifically Order #000000166 (March 10, 2023) seen on the My Orders list, to check for food items and add their amounts.

I attempted twice to use the left sidebar “My Orders” link (bid 1544), but it did not navigate (per prior timeouts). To avoid repeating an ineffective action, I will take a different path: use the header’s “My Account” link (bid 220) to go to the account dashboard, from where I can access My Orders and then open the March 10 order. This should move me closer to completing the calculation.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Current page: “My Account” dashboard. This is on the critical path since it provides navigation to the full order history.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Sidebar link “My Orders” (marker [1541]/[1544] in the left navigation): visible and enabled; use this to access the full order list.
  - “Recent Orders” table (center panel; with “View Order” links such as markers [1474], [1477], [1480], [1483], [1486], [1489]): enabled, but shows recent 2025 orders—not relevant to March 2023.
  - Header “My Account” link [220]: enabled (used to reach this page).
  - Search controls: combobox “Search” [266] present; “Search” button [271] is disabled—irrelevant to the goal.
- Next required action to progress: navigate to My Orders, locate March 2023 orders (e.g., 03/10/2023), open them, identify food-related items, and sum their line subtotals to complete the March total.

Goal: Compute total spent on food-related shopping in March 2023 by reviewing March orders, identifying food items, and summing their line subtotals.

Current context and history:
- I’m on the “My Orders” page (based on the error log and the summary showing View Order links [1379], [1390], [1401], [1412], and pagination with “Page 2” [1494]).
- Previously, I already examined two March 2023 orders on Page 2:
  - Order #000000180 (03/11/23): identified one food item “Jiffy Corn Muffin Cornbread Mix, 40 Ounce Box” — $11.43.
  - Order #000000166 (03/10/23): identified one food item “Kosher MRE Meat Meals Ready to Eat…” — $12.99.
- However, to ensure accuracy, I need to confirm whether there are any other March 2023 orders on Page 2 that I haven’t reviewed and, if needed, re-open 03/11 to verify if additional food items exist in that order.

Plan:
- Navigate to Page 2 of the Orders list using the pagination control (link [1494] “Page 2”).
- On Page 2, check the list for all March 2023 orders, and open any that haven’t been reviewed yet to capture food line subtotals. If only the two known March orders are present, I’ll be ready to finalize the total.

Reason for action:
- The “My Orders” page 1 shows 2025 and May 2023 entries. March 2023 orders were previously on Page 2, so clicking “Page 2” is the correct next step to locate all March 2023 orders efficiently without scrolling.

  - Order #000000166 (03/10/23): identified one food item “Kosher MRE Meat Meals Ready to Eat…” — $12.99.
- However, to ensure accuracy, I need to confirm whether there are any other March 2023 orders on Page 2 that I haven’t reviewed and, if needed, re-open 03/11 to verify if additional food items exist in that order.

Plan:
- Navigate to Page 2 of the Orders list using the pagination control (link [1494] “Page 2”).
- On Page 2, check the list for all March 2023 orders, and open any that haven’t been reviewed yet to capture food line subtotals. If only the two known March orders are present, I’ll be ready to finalize the total.

Reason for action:
- The “My Orders” page 1 shows 2025 and May 2023 entries. March 2023 orders were previously on Page 2, so clicking “Page 2” is the correct next step to locate all March 2023 orders efficiently without scrolling.

✅ Current Progress:
- Reached “My Orders” and opened two March 2023 orders.
- Identified food line items and subtotals:
  - Order #000000180 (03/11/23): “Jiffy Corn Muffin Cornbread Mix, 40 Ounce Box” — $11.43.

- The orders table lists March 2023 entries (e.g., 03/11/23 and 03/10/23 visible; additional March dates appear in the table on this page).
- Relevant interactive elements for progressing:
  - “View Order” link for 03/11/23 row: link labeled “View Order” [1401], visible and enabled.
  - “View Order” link for 03/10/23 row: link labeled “View Order” [1412], visible and enabled.
  - Pagination control “Page 2” [1494], visible and enabled (current page shows March 2023 orders).
- Remaining work: Open any additional March 2023 orders on this page via their “View Order” links and sum food-related line subtotals to finalize the March total. No deviation detected.

The task is to calculate how much was spent on food-related shopping during March 2023. I am currently on the My Orders page (page 2), which shows orders around March 2023. The table includes two March entries: 3/11/23 (Order #000000180) and 3/10/23 (Order #000000166). I previously inspected both orders and noted at least one food item in each: 
- 3/11/23 order had “Jiffy Corn Muffin Cornbread Mix” subtotal $11.43.
- 3/10/23 order had “Kosher MRE Meat Meals Ready to Eat…” subtotal $12.99.

To ensure completeness, I should re-open the 3/11/23 order to verify if there are any additional food items in that order beyond the one already noted. On this page, the “View Order” link for the 3/11/23 order is bid 1401. Clicking it will let me review the full item list for that order and confirm all food-related line items, which is necessary to finalize the March total. The previous attempt to click the pagination link timed out, but I am already on page 2 where this order is listed, so the next best step is to click “View Order” for 3/11/23.

The user asked for the total spent on food-related shopping during March 2023. I navigated to My Orders and identified two orders in March 2023:
- Order #000000180 (March 11, 2023): reviewing its items shows only one food product, “Jiffy Corn Muffin Cornbread Mix, 40 Ounce Box,” subtotal $11.43. Other items (phone case, monopod, cake topper, PS3 skin) are not food.
- Order #000000166 (March 10, 2023): contains a food item “Kosher MRE Meat Meals Ready to Eat…” with subtotal $12.99.

Summing the product line subtotals for food items: 11.43 + 12.99 = 24.42. Per the instruction “When asked how much is spent return just the decimal,” I will return only the number without additional text.
