The goal was to create a post in the books forum announcing a virtual meetup for Big little lies enthusiasts on Sep 10th. I navigated to /f/books, clicked Submit, filled the Title and Body with the exact requested text, and created the submission. The current page shows the post detail with the heading and body matching “virtual meetup for Big little lies enthusiasts on Sep 10th,” submitted in the books forum.
