 <think>
The user wants me to delete all pending negative reviews for the product "Circe fleece." In Magento Admin, reviews are managed under MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews, as noted in the task tips. From the current Dashboard page, I need to navigate to the MARKETING section to access the reviews management interface. Once there, I will look for filters to find the product "Circe fleece," set status to "Pending," identify negative ratings (likely 1 or 2 stars), and delete those reviews. The first step is to click the MARKETING menu link visible in the top navigation bar (id [226]).
