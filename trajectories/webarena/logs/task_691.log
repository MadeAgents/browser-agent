The user wants me to draft an email via the site's "Contact Us" function requesting a coupon for a planned bulk purchase. On the current homepage, I see a footer section that includes a "Contact Us" link (node [1862]). The best next step is to navigate to that contact page so I can view the contact form fields and draft the message accordingly. I will click the "Contact Us" link to proceed to the contact form.

The user wants me to draft an email via the site's Contact Us function requesting a coupon for a planned bulk purchase, but not to send it. I’m already on the Contact Us page, and the Name and Email fields are prefilled. The required message field (“What’s on your mind? *” with bid [1383]) is empty and should contain the drafted text. To progress toward the goal, I will fill that message field with a professional, clear request detailing the bulk purchase intent and asking for available coupon/volume discount information. I will not click Submit since the instructions say to draft only. The next step is to input the drafted message into the message textbox.

I expect to order around 25–30 items across Home & Kitchen and Office Products, with a total likely over $500, within the next week.\n\nCould you please share any available coupon codes or bulk pricing options, including minimum quantities, exclusions, and validity dates? If there is a preferred process for placing bulk orders, please let me know.\n\nThank you!\n\nEmma Lopez\nemma.lopez@gmail.com')```</action>
