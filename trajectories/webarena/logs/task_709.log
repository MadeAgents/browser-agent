The user wants an orders report for a specific date range. On the Magento Admin dashboard, the top navigation includes a "REPORTS" link (bid 339).

From there, I will look for the Orders report page where I can set the date range (beginning of May 2021 to end of March 2022) and then show the report.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to the goal. Key interactive elements for generating the report:
- [753] combobox “Date Used” (value: “Order Created”, expanded=False) — visible and enabled.
- [761] combobox “Period” (value: “Day”, expanded=False) — visible and enabled.
- [769] textbox “From *” — required, currently empty; [770] date-picker button next to it — visible.

- [805] combobox “Empty Rows” (value: “No”) — visible and enabled.
- [812] combobox “Show Actual Values” (value: “No”) — visible and enabled.
- [726] button “Show Report” — visible and clickable.
- [820] label “Export to:” with [821] combobox (value likely “CSV”) and [824] button “Export” — visible and enabled.
Current results area shows “0 records found,” which is expected since the required date fields are not yet filled. Filling “From” (May 1, 2021) and “To” (March 31, 2022) and clicking “Show Report” will generate the report; export can then be done via “Export to” and “Export”.
