The goal is to list products from the "Nutrition Bars & Drinks" category sorted by ascending price.

In that submenu, I see "Diet & Sports Nutrition" (id: 902) with a popup menu, which likely contains "Nutrition Bars & Drinks" as a nested subcategory. Following the browsing tips about using dropdowns and hovering to reveal nested menus, the optimal next step is to hover on "Diet & Sports Nutrition" to expose its deeper subcategories.
