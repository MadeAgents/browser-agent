The user wants to look up orders that are currently in the "Processing" status. To do this in Magento Admin, the typical path is to go to the Sales section and then the Orders grid, where we can filter by order status. From the current Dashboard page, the top navigation bar includes a "SALES" link (bid 156). Clicking this should navigate to the Sales > Orders area or open the Sales section, where we can then apply a filter for "Processing". The best next step is to click the "SALES" menu link to reach the orders list.
