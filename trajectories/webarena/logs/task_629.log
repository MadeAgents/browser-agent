The goal is to create a discussion post in the relevant forum with the title "Fun thing to do in Pittsburgh" and body "your opinion." I am on the Create submission page for the "pittsburgh" forum. The Title field is filled correctly with "Fun thing to do in Pittsburgh," and the Body field contains "your opinion." The forum combobox is set to "pittsburgh." The URL radio is selected, but the URL textbox is empty, which aligns with the instruction to leave the URL field empty and put all content in the Body. The next step is to submit the form by clicking the "Create submission" button to finalize the post.

The user's goal was to create a discussion post titled "Fun thing to do in Pittsburgh" in a relevant subreddit and include the prompt "your opinion." I navigated to the Forums, selected the "pittsburgh" forum, clicked Submit, filled the Title with "Fun thing to do in Pittsburgh," and the Body with "your opinion," then created the submission. The current page shows the post detail in /f/pittsburgh with the title and body matching exactly, confirming the post is live. The Short URL and full URL are visible; the active tab URL is http://10.177.37.113:9999/f/pittsburgh/2/fun-thing-to-do-in-pittsburgh. Since the task is complete, the best next action is to inform the user with a confirmation and the link to the post.
