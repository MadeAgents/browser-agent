The user’s goal is to open a new issue to discuss default .zsh plugins. From the current page state and the progress summary, the new issue has already been created successfully, and we are on the issue detail page for Byte Blaze / dotfiles with the title “Discuss implementation of default .zsh plugins” and status “Open,” with reference byteblaze/dotfiles#3. The accessibility tree confirms the title, description sections (Summary, Goals, Proposed defaults, Implementation outline, Open questions, Todos), and that it was created just now. Since the task is completed, the best next step is to inform the user with a clear confirmation and provide the issue link and key details. I will use send_msg_to_user to provide a concise summary and ask if they want labels, assignees, or milestones set.
