The user's goal is to find the number of commits Steven Woodson made to the project "a11y-webring.club" on 2/6/2023. I'm currently on the GitLab Projects dashboard, where I can see the project "Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club" listed with a link element [509]. To retrieve commit details, I need to navigate into the project. From there, I can explore repository-related tabs such as "Commits" or "Activity." The Activity page often summarizes pushes on specific dates, potentially stating how many commits were pushed by an author on that day, which could directly answer the question. Alternatively, the Commits page may allow filtering by author and date, but Activity may be more straightforward for a daily commit count. The first step is to click into the "a11y-webring.club" project.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the GitLab project page for a11y-webring.club (inside the repository overview). No filtering or commit inspection has been done yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward the goal; from here we can access the commit history to count commits on 2/6/2023 by Steven Woodson.
- Link “235 Commits” (id: [690]) — visible and clickable; leads directly to the repository’s commit list.
- Link “Repository” (id: [301]) — visible and clickable; project navigation entry that also provides access to commits if needed.

The user asks for the number of commits Steven Woodson made to the repository on a specific date (2/6/2023). From the repository overview page currently open, there is a clear “235 Commits” link (bid 690) that should take me to the commit history. On the commits page, I can check entries around Feb 6, 2023 and identify those authored by Steven Woodson. Ideally, the commits page will have filters or a search box to filter by author and date; if not, I can inspect the list for that date. Given the tips to use search/filters when available, the first step is to navigate to the commits list by clicking the “235 Commits” link. I will avoid repeating the previous unsuccessful click and choose the direct commits link visible in the current accessibility tree.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the repository’s Commits page for a11y-webring.club (branch: main). The commit list is visible with date groupings, including “06 Feb, 2023” (currently showing 13 commits across all authors). No author filter has been applied yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to answer how many commits Steven Woodson made on 2/6/2023.
- Button “Author” (id: [653]) — visible, enabled, collapsed (expanded=False). This dropdown should allow filtering by author (needed to isolate Steven Woodson’s commits).
- Search box “Search by message” (id: [695]) — visible, empty; searches commit messages, not suitable for filtering by author.
- Daily group headings and commit list (list id: [700]/items under [701]) — visible; the “06 Feb, 2023” group currently shows “13 commits” for all authors.
- Branch selector “main” (button id: [593]) — visible, set to main; no change needed.

The user asks for the number of commits Steven Woodson made on 2/6/2023. I’m already on the Commits page for the repository and can see the grouped date “06 Feb, 2023” with 13 commits total. Within that group, I need to count entries specifically authored by “Steven Woodson” (not “Steve Woodson”). Inspecting the list under 06 Feb, 2023 shows three entries where the author link text is “Steven Woodson”: 
- “Swap to a relative file path” (7:32pm GMT)
- “Attempting a different folder path, Netlify error” (7:20pm GMT)
- “Attempting a different folder path, Netlify error” (7:18pm GMT)

Other commits on that date include two by “Steve Woodson,” but since the question explicitly says “Steven Woodson,” I will count only those labeled exactly as such. Therefore, the number is 3.

✅ Current Progress: On the repository’s Commits page for a11y-webring.club (branch: main). Date group “06 Feb, 2023” is visible and shows “13 commits” in total. No author filter has been applied yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to determine Steven Woodson’s commit count on 2/6/2023.
- Author filter dropdown (button labeled “Author”, id: [653]) — visible, enabled, collapsed (expanded=False). Needed to isolate commits by “Steven Woodson.”
- Search box “Search by message” (id: [695]) — visible, empty; not useful for author filtering.
- Commit list with date groupings (list id: [700]) — visible; includes “06 Feb, 2023 — 13 commits” (across all authors).
- Branch selector “main” (button id: [593]) — visible, set to main; correct for this task.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the Author dropdown (button id: [653]) and select “Steven Woodson.”
- After filtering, scroll to the “06 Feb, 2023” heading in the commit list (list id: [700]) and read the count shown for that date to report the exact number of Steven Woodson’s commits.
