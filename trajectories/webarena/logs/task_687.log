The user wants me to create a new submission promoting the GitHub repo koush/AndroidAsync in the "funny" forum (subreddit). On Postmill, creating a post is done via the "Submit" button in the top navigation. I need to navigate to the submission form where I can choose the forum (set to "funny"), enter a title and body. The task notes for Reddit/Postmill specify that when creating a post, all content including URLs should be placed in the Body field and the URL field left empty, and to use exact wording from the source for the description. I will first click "Submit" to open the submission form. Once there, I will look for a forum selector to choose "funny", and fields for title and body to include the repo name and its description (to be retrieved or entered). The current page shows the "Submit" link with bid 63. The next step is to click it.

The user wants to create a submission promoting the GitHub repo koush/AndroidAsync in the "funny" forum. We’re on the “Create submission” page with fields for URL (currently selected), Title (required), Body, and Forum (combobox showing “Choose one…”). Based on the Reddit task tips for this site, we should put all content including URLs in the Body field and leave the URL field empty. To proceed, we need to select the forum "funny," fill in the Title (likely “koush/AndroidAsync”), and add the repo description and URL to the Body. Since multiple actions are needed, I’ll start by selecting the forum. The Forum selector is a combobox (bid 383) with an inner textbox (bid 384). The best first step is to click the combobox to open it or focus it so we can type/select "funny" next.
