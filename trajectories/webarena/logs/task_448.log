The user wants to set the homepage URL on their GitLab profile to a specific value. Based on the task tips, to edit profile details, I should use the profile button at the top right and then select "edit profile." On the current GitLab dashboard page, I can see the top-right user menu as a link labeled "Byte Blaze" with id [201]. The next appropriate step is to click that user menu to open the dropdown, which should contain "Edit profile" or similar options. From there, I can proceed to the edit profile page and locate the homepage/website URL field to update it. For now, I will click the "Byte Blaze" link to open the profile menu.
