✅ Current Progress: Reached the Sales > Orders page and loaded the orders grid.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to cancel order 305. However, the current filter targets a different order:
- textbox “Search by keyword” (id: 840) — visible, enabled, current value: “000000301”.
- button “Search” (id: 841) — visible and enabled.
- Active filter shows “Keyword: 000000301” with a remove control (id: 854) and “Clear all” button (id: 857) — visible and enabled.
- table row shows order ID “000000301” with Status “Canceled” — not the target order.
This indicates the agent is viewing order 301 instead of 305.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Type “000000305” into textbox labeled “Search by keyword” (id: 840), then click the “Search” button (id: 841).

The objective is to cancel order 305.
