The user wants to create a project milestone with specific start and end dates. On GitLab, milestones are typically managed under the project's Issues section (Issues > Milestones). From the current project page for "dotfiles," I should navigate to the Issues area to find the Milestones tab and then proceed to create a new milestone. The sidebar in the "Project navigation" includes a link labeled "Issues" (bid 332). Clicking that will take me to the Issues page where I can access Milestones and create a new one with the specified dates. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best action is to click the Issues link.

The goal is to create a project milestone with specific start and end dates. On GitLab, milestones are managed under the Issues section via the Milestones tab. The current page is the Issues area for the "dotfiles" project, and the left sidebar shows the "Milestones" link (bid 350) under the Issues sub-navigation. To proceed toward creating the milestone, I should navigate to the Milestones page by clicking that link. Once there, I will look for a "New milestone" button to input the title (about merging all branches to main) and set the start date to March 15, 2044 and the due date to March 30, 2044.

The user’s goal is to create a milestone with a start date of March 15, 2044 and an end (due) date of March 30, 2044. I’m already on the “New Milestone” form for the dotfiles project. The Title field is filled with “Merge all branches to main,” which matches the requested milestone name. The Start Date textbox shows the value “2044-03-15,” which matches the required start date. The Due Date textbox is currently empty and needs to be set to “2044-03-30.” The calendar widget is visible because the Start Date textbox is focused, but I can directly fill the Due Date field using the fill action; it will focus the element and input the value. The best next step is to fill the Due Date textbox with the required date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

<action>
```fill("614", "2044-03-30")```
