The user wants to know if “the walmart in pittsburgh” can be reached within one hour by car from “5600 fifth avenue.” Following the provided website tips, I should use the directions tool (the two-arrow button) rather than manually panning/scrolling. On the current OpenStreetMap page, I see the search bar and the link labeled “Find directions between two points” (bid 167) next to the Go button. The best next step is to click that directions link to bring up the A/B fields where I can enter the start and destination. Once open, I’ll enter “5600 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA” as the start and “Walmart, Pittsburgh, PA” as the destination, ensure car mode is selected, then compute the route to see the travel time and determine if it’s under 1 hour. For now, I will click the directions button to open the directions panel.

The goal is to determine if Walmart in Pittsburgh can be reached within one hour by car from 5600 Fifth Avenue. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open, with Car mode selected and OSRM as the routing engine. I need to enter the origin and destination in the “From” and “To” textboxes, respectively, then compute the route to see the travel time. Following the Task Tips, it’s best to include the city and state to ensure accurate geocoding. I will first fill the “From” textbox [194] with “5600 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA” to set the starting point, then in subsequent steps fill the “To” textbox with “Walmart, Pittsburgh, PA” and trigger the route calculation (likely by pressing Enter in one of the fields).

The user's goal is to check if Walmart in Pittsburgh can be reached within one hour by car from 5600 Fifth Avenue. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is open with Car mode selected and the From/To fields filled with precise Pittsburgh addresses. The routing engine is currently OSRM, and the panel shows “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” The “Directions services” combobox is expanded and shows options: GraphHopper, OSRM (selected), and Valhalla. Since OSRM returned an error, a common approach is to switch routing engines. The next best action is to select “Valhalla” from the expanded list, which should trigger a recalculation using a different engine. After switching, I can evaluate the resulting route and travel time in the subsequent step.

Past action: Attempted to click Valhalla [186], but it timed out because the element was not visible/interactable.

Plan:
- Since clicking the Valhalla option failed, use keyboard navigation on the focused combobox to change the routing engine. With OSRM currently selected and Valhalla listed below it, pressing ArrowDown on the combobox should move the selection to Valhalla.

Currently, the results show “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” The “Directions services” combobox [182] is focused and expanded with GraphHopper selected, and options OSRM [185], Valhalla [186] visible. Previous attempts to click OSRM timed out due to visibility issues. A reliable approach is to use keyboard navigation on the focused combobox. Pressing ArrowDown should move selection from GraphHopper to OSRM, which may trigger a recalculation. If it computes successfully, I can read the travel time to assess if it’s under one hour. Therefore, the next best single action is to press ArrowDown on the combobox.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened OpenStreetMap Directions panel with travel mode set to Car.
- Entered origin and destination:
  - From [194]: “5600, Fifth Avenue, Squirrel Hill North, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15232, United States”.
  - To [199]: “Walmart Supercenter, 250, Summit Park Drive, RIDC Park West, Beechcliff, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15275, United States”.
- Attempted routing; current engine is OSRM.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is directly on the critical path to determine drive time.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Car mode radio [173]: checked (enabled, visible).
  - Directions services combobox [182]: expanded=True, value="OSRM", focused.
    - Options: GraphHopper [184] (selected=False), OSRM [185] (selected=True), Valhalla [186] (selected=False).
  - From textbox [194]: filled with the full Pittsburgh address (enabled, visible).
  - To textbox [199]: filled with the Walmart address (enabled, visible).
  - Reverse Directions button [200]: enabled, visible.
- Results panel under “Directions” [476] shows: “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” Routing failed with the current engine; inputs appear valid.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click “Valhalla” option [186] in the “Directions services” combobox [182] to recalculate the route.
- If the error persists, click “GraphHopper” option [184] in the same combobox to try another engine.

Objective: Determine if Walmart in Pittsburgh can be reached within one hour by car from 5600 Fifth Avenue using OpenStreetMap’s directions.

Current page state:
- Directions panel is open with Car mode selected.
- From field [194]: “5600, Fifth Avenue, Squirrel Hill North, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15232, United States”
- To field [199]: “Walmart Supercenter, 250, Summit Park Drive, RIDC Park West, Beechcliff, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15275, United States”
- Routing engine combobox [182] is expanded with options:
  - GraphHopper [184]
  - OSRM [185] (currently selected)
  - Valhalla [186]
- Results currently show: “Couldn't find a route between those two places,” which suggests a routing engine issue rather than wrong addresses.

Plan:
- Switch the routing engine to another provider to trigger recalculation. Since OSRM failed, select Valhalla [186]. If that works, it should compute the route and display the travel time. If it still fails, in a subsequent step I can try GraphHopper.

Next action:
- Click the Valhalla option in the routing engine combobox to trigger recalculation.

The task is to determine whether the Walmart in Pittsburgh can be reached within one hour by car from 5600 Fifth Avenue using the OpenStreetMap directions tool. The directions panel shows:
- Mode: Car (checked)
- From: 5600 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15232 (full address present)
- To: Walmart Supercenter, 250 Summit Park Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15275 (full address present)
But the results currently say “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” This is likely due to the routing engine rather than the inputs, since both points are in Pittsburgh and should be routable.

The “Directions services” combobox [182] is expanded with OSRM selected. Attempts to click Valhalla or GraphHopper options directly failed due to visibility issues. A more robust approach is to use the select_option action to change the routing engine programmatically. Changing to another engine (Valhalla or GraphHopper) should trigger route recalculation. I will switch to Valhalla first using select_option on the combobox to attempt to compute a valid route and then evaluate the travel time.
