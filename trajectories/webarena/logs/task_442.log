The user wants to update the project's site title, which likely means changing the HTML <title> tag in the project's index.html. We are on the repository root of the GitLab project "gimmiethat.space" and can see a file listing that includes "index.html" with a recent commit "Update index.html". To change the title, we need to open index.html so we can edit it. On GitLab, clicking the file name opens the file view where there is usually an "Edit" button to modify the file directly in the web UI. Therefore, the next step is to click the "index.html" link in the files table to open it. I will click the link "index.html" (bid 991). I will avoid scrolling as the element is visible and clickable.

The task is to update the site's title in index.html to "Welcome to my site". We are on the blob view of index.html within the GitLab repository. To edit the file directly, we need to access an edit interface. The page shows an "Open in Web IDE" link and a "Toggle dropdown" button that likely contains the "Edit" action. The "Toggle dropdown" [1190] indicates a menu (hasPopup) and is currently collapsed (expanded=False). Clicking it should reveal options including "Edit".

The goal is to update the website title in index.html to "Welcome to my site". We’re currently on the blob view of index.html in the repository. To make changes, we need to open the file in edit mode.

From the accessibility tree, there is a visible "Edit" link with bid 1188 near the file details (alongside "Copy file path", "Open raw", etc.). Previously, I attempted to use the "Toggle dropdown" and then click an "Edit" item presumed to be inside that dropdown, but the tree actually shows that the dropdown contains "Replace" and "Delete" and the main "Edit" action is the standalone link 1188. Therefore, the correct next step is to click the "Edit" link [1188] to open the inline editor for this file. Once in the editor, I will modify the <title> tag from "GIVE ME SPACE" to "Welcome to my site" and then commit the change to the main branch.

The user wants the site's title changed to "Welcome to my site". We are on the GitLab "Edit file" page for index.html with the code editor open. The current <title> is "GIVE ME SPACE", and the Find widget is already open with "GIVE ME SPACE" in the Find field (1 of 1 match). The safest and most precise way to modify only the title text is to use the editor’s Replace functionality. The Replace input is currently hidden; there is a "Toggle Replace" button (bid 1867) with expanded=False. I will click "Toggle Replace" to reveal the replace field so that I can enter "Welcome to my site" and then perform the replacement, followed by committing the change to main.
