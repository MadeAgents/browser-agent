The user wants the top 3 contributors to the "metaseq" repository ranked by number of commits. I’m on the GitLab dashboard. According to the tips, the global search bar is not working, and I should instead use the direct search URL pattern: http://10.177.37.113:8023/search?search=<repository-name>&nav_source=navbar. Using this will help me find the "metaseq" repository quickly. Once on the search results page, I can click into the repository, go to its Repository tab, then the Contributors sub-tab to see contributors and their commit counts. Since I can only perform one action at a time, the best next step is to navigate to the search URL for "metaseq".

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path; to find top contributors, the agent must open the correct metaseq repository and then navigate to its contributors/graphs view.
- Search input: searchbox labeled “Search for projects, issues, etc.” (node [231]), value set to “metaseq”, enabled and visible. “Search” button (node [235]) visible and enabled.

The user needs the top 3 contributors to the metaseq repository, ranked by commits, including their names and commit counts. From the search results page for "metaseq," there are two project entries: "Byte Blaze / metaseq" and "Administrator / metaseq." The "Administrator / metaseq" entry shows higher activity metrics (e.g., 41 and 95), suggesting it’s the primary/original repo rather than a fork. To find contributors, I should enter the repository, then go to the Repository section’s "Contributors" tab (per tip #7).

The user’s goal is to list the top 3 contributors to the metaseq repository, ranked by number of commits, with names and commit counts.

- Zachary DeVito — 12 commits
Since the request is for the top 3 contributors, I will provide the top three by descending commit count. There’s a tie at 12 for third place; to keep to exactly three names, I’ll list Peter Albert (as presented first) and briefly note the tie with Zachary DeVito for completeness. I will now send the concise answer to the user.
