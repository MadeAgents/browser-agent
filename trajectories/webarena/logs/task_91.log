The user asks which US states border Massachusetts. I should use the OpenStreetMap site’s search functionality to navigate to Massachusetts to verify its neighboring states. The current page shows the OpenStreetMap homepage with the search textbox labeled "Search" (element 162) already focused. The appropriate next step is to enter "Massachusetts" into the search field. After that, I will click the "Go" button to get to the Massachusetts map, then determine and confirm the bordering states.

✅ Current Progress: Entered “Massachusetts” into the site’s search box. No search has been submitted yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is relevant to the goal; using OpenStreetMap’s search should help locate Massachusetts and infer bordering states. Key elements:
- [162] textbox labeled “Search” — value='Massachusetts', focused, visible, filled.
- [165] button “Go” — visible and enabled; submits the search query.
- [217] button “Close” — visible; closes the welcome panel (not strictly required but may improve visibility).
- Map controls like [434] “Zoom In” and [436] “Zoom Out” are available after navigating to Massachusetts.

The task is to determine which US states border Massachusetts using the OpenStreetMap site. The search textbox [162] is already filled with "Massachusetts". To proceed, I should submit the search by clicking the "Go" button [165]. This should bring up search results or navigate to the Massachusetts area, from which I can identify neighboring states. The welcome panel is present but not blocking the "Go" button, so the most direct next step is to click "Go".

The user asks which US states border Massachusetts. The current OpenStreetMap page shows Massachusetts centered, with neighboring state labels visible (New York to the west, Vermont and New Hampshire to the north, Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south). No further navigation is necessary to identify the bordering states. The best next step is to provide the concise answer directly via a message to the user. I will use send_msg_to_user with a comma-separated list of states: New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island.
