The user requests: "Thumbs down the top 4 post ever in movies." On this platform, "thumbs down" corresponds to downvoting. To do this, I need to:
1) Navigate to the "movies" forum (subreddit is called 'forum' here).
2) View posts sorted by "Top" for "All time" (i.e., ever).
3) Downvote the top four posts in that listing.

Currently I'm on the Home page with the "Subscribed" filter and "Hot" sort. I need to navigate to the forum list to find "movies". The tips suggest: to find a relevant forum, click "alphabetical" in the "Forum" tab. First step is to click the "Forums" link in the header navigation. The Accessibility Tree shows a link 'Forums' [43]. I will click that to get to the forums page, where I can search or navigate to 'movies'. After that, on the movies forum page, I'll adjust sorting to Top and time filter to "All time" if provided, then downvote the top 4 posts. For now, the best next action is clicking the "Forums" link.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated into the /f/movies forum. No sorting to “Top (All time)” has been applied yet, and no posts have been downvoted.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward the goal. To downvote the top 4 posts ever, the listing must be switched from “Hot” to “Top”.
- Sorting control:
  - Button: "Sort by: Hot" (node [128], hasPopup='menu', expanded=False, visible/enabled).
- Example downvote controls currently visible under the first few articles (listing is still Hot):
  - Article "Harry Potter movie series": Downvote button (node [183], enabled); Upvote is currently active ("Retract upvote" shown at [173]).
  - Article "Who will win the Oscar for ACTRESS IN A SUPPORTING ROLE?": Downvote button (node [220], enabled).
  - Article "Who will win the Oscar for FILM EDITING?": Downvote button (node [257], enabled).

To achieve the goal, first change sorting to “Top” (and, if a time range appears, choose “All time”), then downvote the top four posts using their respective Downvote buttons.

- Sorting changed to “Top”.
- No posts have been downvoted yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- On the correct forum page, but time range is not set to “ever,” so current listing is not the “top ever.”
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Sort control: button “Sort by: Top” (id [127], visible, expanded=False).
  - Time-range control: button “From: Past 24 hours” (id [146], visible, expanded=False) — needs to be changed to “All time” to meet the goal.
  - First visible post shows voting controls:
    - “Retract upvote” button (id [189], visible)
    - “Downvote” button (id [199], visible, enabled)
- Only one article (“Harry Potter movie series”) is visible, confirming the current filter is too restrictive for “top ever.”

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the time-range button labeled “From: Past 24 hours” (id [146]) to open the menu and select the “All time” option when it appears. After switching to “All time,” downvote the first four posts using their “Downvote” buttons.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to /f/movies.
- Sorting set to “Top”.
- Time range set to “All time”.
- Clicked “Retract downvote” on Post 1 (“Who will win the Oscar for ACTRESS IN A SUPPORTING ROLE?”), which conflicts with the goal. No confirmed downvotes applied to the top 4 yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path: it shows the top posts in /f/movies for all time.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Sort control: button “Sort by: Top” (id [128], visible, correct).
  - Time-range control: button “From: All time” (id [147], visible, correct).
  - Post 1 (“Who will win the Oscar for ACTRESS IN A SUPPORTING ROLE?”): button “Retract downvote” (id [195], visible/enabled) — clicking this retracts an existing downvote.
  - Post 2 (“Who will win the Oscar for FILM EDITING?”): button “Downvote” (id [232], visible/enabled).
  - Post 3 (“Cindy Williams Dies: …”): button “Downvote” (id [276], visible/enabled).
  - Post 4 (“Michelle Yeoh to Receive Palm Springs Film Festival’s International Star Award”): article (id [281]); Downvote button present (visible text “Downvote”, enabled; specific button id not shown in provided tree).
- The recent action (clicking “Retract downvote” on Post 1) is counterproductive relative to the goal.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the “Downvote” button for Post 2 (id [232]).
- Click the “Downvote” button for Post 3 (id [276]).

The user wants me to thumbs down (downvote) the top 4 posts ever in the /f/movies forum. I’m on the correct page: /f/movies sorted by “Top” and filtered by “All time,” as indicated by the controls (“Sort by: Top” and “From: All time”). The first four listed posts each have voting controls:

1) “Who will win the Oscar for ACTRESS IN A SUPPORTING ROLE?” — currently shows “Retract downvote,” which means it is already downvoted. My previous click on this was a mistake since it would retract the downvote. I should avoid clicking it again now to prevent toggling.
2) “Who will win the Oscar for FILM EDITING?” — shows a “Downvote” button (bid 232).
3) “Cindy Williams Dies: …” — shows a “Downvote” button (bid 276).
4) “Michelle Yeoh to Receive Palm Springs Film Festival’s International Star Award” — shows a “Downvote” button (bid 314).

To achieve the goal, I will downvote posts 2–4 first since they clearly show “Downvote,” then revisit post 1 if needed to ensure it remains downvoted. The next best single action is to click the Downvote button on the second post (bid 232).

✅ Current Progress:
- Arrived at /f/movies with sorting set to “Top” and time range set to “All time”.
- No confirmed progress on downvoting the top 4 posts; recent clicks targeted “Retract downvote” controls, which would undo downvotes.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is correct for achieving the goal (top posts in /f/movies, all-time).
- Relevant interactive elements and states for the top 4 posts:
  1) Post: “Who will win the Oscar for ACTRESS IN A SUPPORTING ROLE?”
     - Button id [195]: “Retract downvote” (visible/enabled) — indicates already downvoted; do NOT click if the goal is to keep it downvoted.
  2) Post: “Who will win the Oscar for FILM EDITING?”
     - Button id [232]: “Retract downvote” (visible/enabled) — indicates already downvoted; clicking would undo the downvote.
  3) Post: “Cindy Williams Dies: ‘Laverne & Shirley‘ Star …”
     - Button id [276]: “Downvote” (visible/enabled) — not yet downvoted.
  4) Post: “Michelle Yeoh to Receive Palm Springs Film Festival’s International Star Award”
     - Button id [314]: “Downvote” (visible/enabled) — not yet downvoted.
- Deviation detected: The previous clicks on [195] and [232] (both labeled “Retract downvote”) are counter to the goal as they would retract existing downvotes.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the “Downvote” button for Post 3: button id [276].
- Click the “Downvote” button for Post 4: button id [314].

Task: Thumbs down the top 4 posts ever in /f/movies. The page is already on /f/movies with sorting set to Top and time range to All time. The top posts are listed as articles with voting controls. For each article, there are Upvote and Downvote buttons.

From the current page state:
- Post 1 shows "Retract downvote", meaning it is/was downvoted.
- Post 2 shows "Retract downvote", meaning it is/was downvoted.
- Post 3 shows a "Downvote" button with bid 276.
- Post 4 shows a "Downvote" button with bid 314.

I previously clicked the “Retract downvote” buttons for posts 1 (bid 195) and 2 (bid 232), which likely removed their downvotes. To achieve the goal, I should now ensure the remaining posts are downvoted. The next best single action is to downvote the third post by clicking its "Downvote" button (bid 276). After that, I will proceed to downvote post 4, then return to ensure posts 1 and 2 are downvoted again.

- Prior misclicks: clicked “Retract downvote” on Post 1 (id [195]) and Post 2 (id [232]), which would undo downvotes.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is correct and on the critical path to the goal (top posts in /f/movies, all-time).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Sort control: button “Sort by: Top” (id [128], visible/enabled).
  - Time filter: button “From: All time” (id [147], visible/enabled).

  - Post 4 (“Michelle Yeoh to Receive Palm Springs Film Festival’s International Star Award”): button “Downvote” (id [314], visible/enabled).

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the “Downvote” button on Post 4: button id [314].
- For Posts 1 and 2, only click if their buttons read “Downvote” (ids [195] and [232]); do not click if they read “Retract downvote”.

✅ Current Progress:
- Reached /f/movies and set listing to Sort by: Top and From: All time.
- Downvote clicks executed on Post 3 (button id 276) and Post 4 (button id 314).
- Earlier misclicks: “Retract downvote” was clicked on Post 1 (id 195) and Post 2 (id 232), which would have removed their downvotes.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page is correct and on the critical path (Top of All time in /f/movies).
- Relevant interactive elements (visible/enabled):
  - Sort control: button “Sort by: Top” (id 128).
  - Time filter: button “From: All time” (id 147).
  - Post 1 (“Who will win the Oscar for ACTRESS IN A SUPPORTING ROLE?”): button id 195 (“Retract downvote” in axtree).
  - Post 2 (“Who will win the Oscar for FILM EDITING?”): button id 232 (“Retract downvote” in axtree).
  - Post 3 (“Cindy Williams Dies: …”): button id 276 (“Retract downvote”).
  - Post 4 (“Michelle Yeoh to Receive Palm Springs Film Festival’s International Star Award”): button id 314 (Downvote was clicked).
- Because “Retract downvote” was clicked earlier on Posts 1 and 2, those two posts likely need their downvotes re-applied to satisfy the goal of thumbs-downing the top 4 posts.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the Downvote button on Post 1: button id 195 (only if it reads “Downvote”; skip if it reads “Retract downvote”).
- Then click the Downvote button on Post 2: button id 232 (only if it reads “Downvote”; skip if it reads “Retract downvote”).
