The user's goal is to find the estimated driving time between two places using the OpenStreetMap site that's already open. The fastest way is to use the built-in directions tool rather than manually navigating on the map. I see the "Find directions between two points" control (bid 167) in the UI. The general process on this site is: click the directions icon/link to open the directions panel, enter the origin and destination into the two fields, and then press the button to compute the route (the benchmark tips mention there is a 'press' button after entry).

The phrase "the city of Niagara Falls" is ambiguous (could be in NY or Ontario), but typically, when pairing with Yale University (in New Haven, CT, USA), the intended U.S. city is Niagara Falls, New York. The "city of Yale University" suggests the destination should be the city where Yale is located, i.e., New Haven, Connecticut. To minimize ambiguity, I will input "Niagara Falls, NY" and "New Haven, CT" (or possibly "Yale University" which should resolve to New Haven). However, I need to first open the directions panel before I can fill any fields.

Therefore, the best next action is to click the "Find directions between two points" link (bid 167) to bring up the route input fields.
