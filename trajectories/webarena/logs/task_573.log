The user wants their address updated after a move. On the current "My Account" dashboard, I can see both Default Billing Address and Default Shipping Address still set to the old Seattle address. To update both efficiently, the "Manage Addresses" link (bid 1483) in the Address Book section is the correct pathway, as it typically provides access to edit both default billing and shipping addresses. Once there, I will look for edit forms, update street, city, state, and ZIP to: 987 Sycamore Circle, Philadelphia, PA, 19102 (United States), keeping the existing phone if required since the user didn't specify changes to phone.

The user wants their address updated to 987 Sycamore Circle, Philadelphia, PA, 19102. I am on the Edit Address page. From the current state:
- Street Address Line 1 is already set to "987 Sycamore Circle."
- State/Province is "Pennsylvania."
- City is "Philadelphia."
- Zip/Postal Code is still "98101" and needs to be updated to "19102."
There is a Street Address Line 2 currently set to "Suite 300"; since the user didn't specify a suite, I may clear it later if allowed, but first I should correct the ZIP code. After updating the ZIP, the next logical step would be to click "Save Address." For now, I will update the Zip/Postal Code field to 19102.

The user asked to update their address to “987 Sycamore Circle, Philadelphia, PA, 19102.” I navigated to the Edit Address form and updated all the key fields:
- Street Address Line 1 is set to “987 Sycamore Circle”
- City is “Philadelphia”
- State/Province is “Pennsylvania”
- Zip/Postal Code is “19102”
Country remains “United States.” The form indicates this is both the default billing and shipping address, so saving will apply to both. Street Address Line 2 currently contains “Suite 300.” Since the user didn’t provide a suite and the field appears marked as required in the accessibility tree (which might be a generic label), I will avoid clearing it now to prevent a validation error and proceed to save the address. The next logical step is to click “Save Address” to commit the changes.
