The user asks for the top-2 best-selling products in 2022. The Dashboard shows a Bestsellers widget, but it’s not filtered by a specific year, so I should use the Reports section where I can set an explicit date range. According to the tips, I can generate reports via REPORTS and choose the appropriate report type, then set dates and click Show Report. Typically, Magento has Reports > Products > Ordered (or Bestsellers) with a date range. I will first click the REPORTS menu to navigate to the reports area and then look for a products/bestsellers or ordered report, set From 01/01/2022 To 12/31/2022, run the report, sort by ordered quantity descending, and identify the top two product names exactly as displayed (preserving ™ symbols). The next best step is to click the REPORTS menu item to get to that section.

The user asks for the top-2 best-selling products in 2022. I’m currently on the Dashboard with the Reports overlay open, showing various report links including the “Products” section with “Bestsellers” and “Ordered.” To precisely identify best-sellers for a specific year, I should navigate to Reports > Products > Bestsellers, then set the date range to From 01/01/2022 to 12/31/2022, and click “Show Report.” This will generate a list ranked by ordered quantity, from which I can read the top two items.

The table currently shows "0 records found" because the report hasn't been executed yet. The next step is to click the "Show Report" button to generate the data.

The user asks for the top-2 best-selling products in 2022. I’m already on the Bestsellers Report page with Period set to Year and the date range From 01/01/2022 to 12/31/2022, and I clicked “Show Report.” The results table displays product names and their "Order Quantity" for 2022. I observe:
- Quest Lumaflex™ Band — Order Quantity 5 (highest)
- Cruise Dual Analog Watch — Order Quantity 4
- Sprite Stasis Ball 55 cm — Order Quantity 4
- Sprite Stasis Ball 65 cm — Order Quantity 4
- Sprite Stasis Ball 55 cm — Order Quantity 3

This means the top seller is Quest Lumaflex™ Band (5). The next highest quantity is 4, and there is a three-way tie among Cruise Dual Analog Watch, Sprite Stasis Ball 55 cm, and Sprite Stasis Ball 65 cm. Since the user asked for the top-2 best-selling products, I will report the top product and then indicate that second place is a tie among those three, preserving exact product names and symbols. I will communicate this via a single send_msg_to_user action.
