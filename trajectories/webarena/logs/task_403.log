The user wants to change their Reddit-like site bio to "Awesome Prompt Artist". On the current Postmill page, I see a user menu button labeled "MarvelsGrantMan136" with a menu popup. Typically, editing profile/bio is under the user menu (e.g., Profile or Settings). The logical first step is to open this user menu to access profile or settings options. I will click the user button to expand the menu.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward changing the bio. The expanded user menu (button id 68, expanded=True) shows relevant links:
- link “Profile” (id 81) — visible and clickable.
- link “My account” (id 85) — visible and clickable.
- link “User settings” (id 89) — visible and clickable.
These are the likely entry points to edit the bio. No errors or off-track navigation detected.

The goal is to change the bio to "Awesome Prompt Artist". On the current Postmill page, the user dropdown for "MarvelsGrantMan136" is already expanded, showing options like "Profile", "My account", and "User settings". Typically, editing a bio is done via settings rather than just viewing the profile. "My account" likely handles credentials and email, while "User settings" is the most probable place to edit profile details like bio. Therefore, the next best step is to navigate to "User settings" by clicking that link so we can locate the bio field and update it.
