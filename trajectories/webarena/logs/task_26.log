✅ Current Progress: Opened the product’s Reviews section; customer reviews with reviewer names are visible for scanning.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path for identifying reviewers who mention complaints about customer service. The visible reviews include “Review by Goldfishfish,” “Review by B Shray,” “Review by Raymond Brenda Coffey,” “Review by Alan Vegas,” “Review by MaryRyan,” “Review by AMAZON SHOPAHOLIC AMAZON SHOPAHOLIC,” “Review by Angela Healy Knipe,” “Review by Meghan,” “Review by Dylan Sparks,” and “Review by Hattie Craig, Les Productions.” Relevant interactive elements:
- Link “12 Reviews” (axtree [1534]) — currently shows the reviews list.
- Pagination controls with visible page numbers (e.g., “1”, “2”, “3”) and navigation (e.g., “Next”) — enabled and clickable to view more reviews.
- “Add Your Review” link (axtree [1537]) and input fields (“Nickname”, “Summary”, “Review”) — present but not needed for the goal.

No deviation detected; continue scanning the visible reviews and, if needed, use the pagination controls to access all review pages.

- “RemyRRemyR” (couldn’t find customer support phone number, negative experience with customer service call and warranty handling)
