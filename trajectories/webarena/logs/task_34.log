The user's goal is to find a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport and then determine the shortest walking time to a supermarket from that hotel using OpenStreetMap. The current OpenStreetMap page is centered on Singapore, but the search bar is available and focused (bid 162). It's more efficient to search for the specific Hyatt hotel directly rather than first navigating to the airport. OpenStreetMap's search can locate POIs globally. I will enter "Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport" into the search field, which is the known Hyatt hotel located at the airport. After that, I'll click Go to navigate to the hotel, then use the directions feature to find walking directions to a nearby supermarket. For now, I will perform the first step: filling the search query in the search box.

✅ Current Progress: Entered the query “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport” into the OpenStreetMap search box.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap with the search field populated—this is on the critical path to locating a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport and then checking walking directions to a supermarket.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Textbox labeled “Search” (id 162): value set to “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport”, focused, visible.
  - Button “Go” (id 165): visible; appears enabled for submitting the search.
  - Link “Find directions between two points” (id 167): visible; will be useful after locating the hotel.
  - Button “Close” for the welcome panel (id 217): visible; can be closed if it obstructs the UI.
No errors detected; the next step is to execute the search and proceed to directions from the hotel to a nearby supermarket.

The task: Identify a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport and then compute the shortest walking time from that hotel to a supermarket using OpenStreetMap. The current page is OSM’s directions view. The accessibility tree shows:
- Routing mode with radios; “Foot” is checked (good).
- Directions service set to OSRM.
- “From” textbox [194] already contains “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport, 1111, Airport Boulevard, Findlay Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15231, United States” — confirming the hotel’s name and full address.
- “To” textbox [199] is empty.
- “Reverse Directions” button [200] is present.

We need to get walking directions to the nearest supermarket. On OSM, typing a generic POI type like “supermarket” in the destination typically selects the nearest one for routing (or shows suggestions). The key next step is to fill the “To” field with “supermarket”; after that, if needed, we can press Enter to compute. Since only one action is allowed per step, I will fill the To textbox now.

To avoid the global geocoder picking a faraway location again, I will constrain the query by adding a local place reference. Moon Township (zip 15108) is the area adjacent to the airport with supermarkets like Giant Eagle and ALDI, and is likely closer than using only the 15231 airport zip. The next step is to replace the "To" field with "supermarket Moon Township, PA". After that, I can press Enter to compute the walking route and get the time.

The “From” field [194] contains the full address for “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport, 1111, Airport Boulevard, Findlay Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15231, United States,” confirming the Hyatt hotel. The mode is set to Foot (radio [179] checked). The “To” field [199] has “supermarket Moon Township, PA,” but the system showed “Search failed” and now “Couldn't find a route between those two places,” implying the destination didn’t resolve properly or is unreachable via foot. To proceed, I should replace the generic “supermarket Moon Township, PA” with a specific nearby supermarket POI to allow routing. A known one is “Giant Eagle Supermarket, 5990 University Boulevard, Moon Township, PA 15108.” After filling this precise destination, I can press Enter to compute the walking route. Since only one action is allowed per step, I will first fill the To field with the specific supermarket.

✅ Current Progress:
- Identified nearby Hyatt hotel: Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport (1111 Airport Boulevard, Findlay Township, PA 15231).
- Opened Directions panel and set travel mode to Foot.
- Set origin “From” to the hotel and destination “To” to “Giant Eagle Supermarket, 5990 University Boulevard, Moon Township, PA 15108”.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page is relevant and on the critical path to the goal (OpenStreetMap Directions).
- Current routing status shows an error: “Couldn't find a route between those two places.”
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - From textbox “From” [194]: filled with the hotel’s full address; visible and enabled.
  - To textbox “To” [199]: filled with “Giant Eagle Supermarket, 5990 University Boulevard, Moon Township, PA 15108”; focused, visible, enabled.
  - Mode radio “Foot” [179]: checked; visible and enabled.
  - Directions service combobox “Directions services” [182]: value='OSRM'; visible and enabled.
  - “Reverse Directions” button [200]: visible and enabled.
- Likely issue: route has not been recomputed after updating the “To” field, or OSRM cannot find a pedestrian path; retrying and/or switching service is needed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Compute the route: press Enter in the “To” field [199] to recalculate walking directions.
- If the error persists, switch routing engine: open “Directions services” [182], select “Valhalla” [186] (or “GraphHopper” [184]), then press Enter in “To” [199] again to re-run the route.

The user asked for a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport and the shortest walking time to a supermarket from that hotel. I am on OpenStreetMap with the Directions panel open. Current state:
- Mode is set to Foot (radio checked).
- From field [194] is the Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport with full address (confirming the Hyatt near the airport).
- To field [199] currently has a specific local destination: “Giant Eagle Supermarket, 5990 University Boulevard, Moon Township, PA 15108” and is focused.
- The page shows an old error “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” That message likely reflects a prior failed attempt before I set the precise destination.

To proceed, I need to compute the route now that the To field is correctly set. The next optimal step is to submit the directions by pressing Enter in the To field. If this still fails, I will consider switching the routing engine from OSRM to Valhalla or GraphHopper. For now, I will press Enter to trigger the walking route calculation and obtain the time.

The user wants the name of a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport and the shortest walking time from that hotel to a supermarket. We’re already on OpenStreetMap with the Directions panel showing:
- Mode: Foot (checked), which is correct for walking time.
- From: Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport (full address visible).
- To: Giant Eagle at 5990 University Boulevard with a computed walking route (20km, 4:27).

However, the user asks for the shortest walking time to a supermarket from the hotel, not necessarily to that specific Giant Eagle. To find possibly shorter walking times, I should try another nearby supermarket and compare times. A likely candidate is ALDI in Moon Township, which may be closer. The “To” textbox [199] is focused, so I can replace it with a query for “ALDI Moon Township, PA” and then, in a subsequent action, press Enter to compute the route.
