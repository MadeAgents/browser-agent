🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward creating an issue in the cloud-to-butt repo. Relevant elements:
- searchbox labeled “Filter by name” (id: 273), value='cloud-to-butt', focused and editable.
- repository link “Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt” (id: 1137), visible and clickable, associated with heading (id: 1136).
- global navigation link “Issues” (id: 153), visible and clickable, but likely routes to a global issues dashboard rather than the specific project.
To proceed toward the goal, the essential next interaction is the project link “Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt” (id: 1137) to enter the repository, then use its Issues section to create and configure the new issue.

The user’s goal is to create an issue in the cloud-to-butt repo with the given title, assign it to myself, and set the due date to the end of Q1 2033. I’m already on the “New Issue” form, the title field is correctly filled with “Let's keep the project alive,” and the Assignee shows “Byte Blaze,” indicating it’s assigned to me. The remaining step before creating the issue is to set the due date. The page shows a textbox labeled “Select due date” (bid 854). GitLab typically accepts dates in YYYY-MM-DD format. The end of Q1 2033 is March 31, 2033, so I should fill the due date field with “2033-03-31.” After successfully setting the date, I can submit the issue with the Create issue button, but only one action is allowed right now, so I’ll fill the due date first.
