The user needs a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport and the walking distance to the nearest locally owned supermarket from that hotel. I must use the OpenStreetMap website only. The page shows the OSM main view with a search textbox focused (bid 162) and a "Go" button (bid 165). The current map is centered on Hong Kong (22.3567,114.1363), so I need to search for "Pittsburgh International Airport" to navigate to the correct area. Using the search is recommended per the tips. After locating the airport, I can look for nearby Hilton-branded hotels (e.g., DoubleTree by Hilton Pittsburgh Airport, Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport) and then find the nearest supermarket owned by a local company; candidates could include "Giant Eagle" (a Pittsburgh-based company) or "Community Market," etc. Giant Eagle is a local company in Pittsburgh; their supermarkets should appear on OSM as "Giant Eagle." Once I identify a Hilton hotel, I can use the directions tool (two-arrow button) to compute walking distance to the nearest Giant Eagle. First step: search for Pittsburgh International Airport using the search box and Go.

We need to identify a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport and then compute walking distance to the nearest locally owned supermarket (e.g., Giant Eagle) from that hotel. We're on OpenStreetMap with the airport search loaded. The quickest way to find a Hilton property is to use the search bar rather than panning/scrolling. I will search for "DoubleTree by Hilton Pittsburgh Airport," a Hilton brand hotel known to be near the airport, to get a specific POI on the map. Once the hotel is located, I can use the directions tool to measure walking distance to the nearest Giant Eagle (a Pittsburgh-based chain, thus locally owned). First, update the search field.

Goal: Find a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport and then determine the walking distance to the nearest locally owned supermarket from that hotel. We must use OpenStreetMap only.

Current page: OSM centered on Pittsburgh International Airport area with Search Results showing "No results found" for "DoubleTree by Hilton Pittsburgh Airport". That suggests the specific query didn't return results in the current bounding box or dataset. Strategy: Try another Hilton brand nearby, such as "Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport", which is known to be near PIT. Use the search bar, since searching is preferred over panning/scrolling and the site discourages scrolling.

Plan steps:
1) Enter "Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport" in the search box and click Go to locate a Hilton hotel near the airport.
2) If results show the hotel, select it to focus the map on the hotel POI.
3) Use the directions (two-arrow) tool to compute walking distance to the nearest locally owned supermarket. In Pittsburgh, Giant Eagle is a local company, so search for "Giant Eagle" from the hotel as the destination and choose the nearest one to get the walking distance.

Immediate next action: Replace the search text with "Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport" to prepare for the search, then in the following step click Go.

Objective: Provide the name of a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT), then determine the walking distance to the nearest locally owned supermarket from that hotel, using only OpenStreetMap. The current OSM page shows the map centered at PIT with the search box currently containing “Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport,” and Search Results showing “No results found,” likely for the last executed search. To fulfill the first part (Hilton hotel near PIT), I should search for a known Hilton-brand property in the immediate vicinity. Nearby Hilton-brand hotels include “DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Pittsburgh Airport” and “Hampton Inn Pittsburgh Airport.” Since the tab title references “DoubleTree by Hilton Pittsburgh Airport,” it’s reasonable that OSM likely recognizes the hotel but may require the exact phrasing used in OSM’s data. I’ll attempt “DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Pittsburgh Airport” as a more precise query. Using the search is recommended over scrolling. After I get a result, I will select it, then use the directions tool, set mode to foot, and search for “Giant Eagle” (a Pittsburgh-based local supermarket chain) to get the walking distance to the nearest location. For now, the next best action is to update the search box with “DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Pittsburgh Airport” before executing the search with Go in a subsequent step.

To progress, I should try another Hilton brand known near PIT: "Hampton Inn Pittsburgh Airport" (commonly listed in Moon Township/Coraopolis). Using the search bar is recommended, and since clicking Go with the current query yielded no results, I will change the query first to "Hampton Inn Pittsburgh Airport" and then in the following step click Go. Once I find a Hilton property, I will use the directions tool to find walking distance to the nearest Giant Eagle (a local Pittsburgh-based supermarket chain).

The user’s goal is to identify a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport and then compute the walking distance to the nearest locally owned supermarket. We must use OpenStreetMap only. The current page shows the OpenStreetMap search interface focused on the airport area; the search textbox (bid 162) currently contains “Hampton Inn Pittsburgh Airport.” The Search Results currently show “No results found” from a prior query, and the “Go” button (bid 165) is available. Since the search term is already set to a Hilton brand that should be near PIT, the next logical step is to execute the search by clicking “Go.” This may return an OSM listing for Hampton Inn (Hilton brand). If results appear, I’ll then select the hotel and proceed to directions with the two-arrow button to find walking distance to a nearby Giant Eagle (local company). For now, I should run the search.

The user wants a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport and then the walking distance to the nearest locally owned supermarket from that hotel, using only OpenStreetMap. The current OSM page shows the map centered on PIT, but our specific hotel queries (Hampton Inn, DoubleTree, Hilton Garden Inn) have returned "No results found," likely due to the current viewport/bounding box limiting Nominatim results. A broader search term can surface available Hilton-branded properties within the visible area.

The task is to find a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport and then compute the walking distance to the nearest locally owned supermarket using only the current OpenStreetMap interface. The map is already centered around PIT, and the search textbox (bid 162) currently contains “Hilton.” The “Search Results” panel still shows “No results found,” but that corresponds to a previous query. To proceed, I should execute the current “Hilton” query by clicking the “Go” button (bid 165). This aligns with the tips emphasizing the use of the search bar rather than scrolling. Once results appear, I will select a nearby Hilton-branded hotel (e.g., DoubleTree by Hilton Pittsburgh Airport, Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport, Hampton Inn Pittsburgh Airport). After selecting a hotel, I will use the directions tool (the two-arrow icon link “Find directions between two points”) to set the hotel as the start and search for “Giant Eagle” (a local Pittsburgh-based supermarket company) as the destination, switch to walking mode if available, and read off the walking distance. The immediate next step is to execute the search for “Hilton.”

The current page shows the airport search results and the map centered on PIT. To find a Hilton property nearby, it’s best to use the search bar rather than panning or scrolling. I will change the search query to "Hilton" to retrieve Hilton-branded locations within the current map bounds around the airport. After updating the search term, I will execute it in the next step to get results, select a nearby Hilton hotel, and then use the directions tool to measure walking distance to a local supermarket such as Giant Eagle.

We need to provide the name of a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport and then determine the walking distance to the nearest locally owned supermarket from that hotel, using only OpenStreetMap.

Current page status:
- The OpenStreetMap page shows “Search Results” with a listing for “DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Pittsburgh Airport, 8402, University Boulevard, Moon Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15108, United States” (bid 752).
- The map is centered on a building with a pin labeled “DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Pittsburgh Airport,” confirming a Hilton-branded hotel near PIT.
- The UI elements include:
  - Search textbox (bid 162) containing “DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Pittsburgh Airport”
  - Go button (bid 165)
  - “Find directions between two points” (two-arrow) link (bid 167)

Plan:
1) Open the directions tool via the two-arrow icon (bid 167). This will bring up the route planner.
2) Set the starting point as the hotel. Often, the directions tool uses the map marker/selected item; if not, I’ll input the hotel name in the “From” field.
3) For destination, search for a local supermarket brand. In Pittsburgh, “Giant Eagle” is a local company. I’ll use “Giant Eagle” to find the nearest location.
4) Ensure walking mode is selected (if available) and compute the route to read the walking distance.
5) Report back the hotel name (DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Pittsburgh Airport) and the walking distance to the nearest Giant Eagle in the required format (distance like “645m”).

Immediate next action:
Click the “Find directions between two points” link (bid 167) to open the directions panel so I can enter the start (hotel) and destination (Giant Eagle).

 <think>
The goal is to provide the name of a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport and then determine the walking distance to the nearest locally owned supermarket from that hotel, using the OpenStreetMap interface. The current page shows the OSM Directions panel open with the “To” field already populated with “DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Pittsburgh Airport, 8402, University Boulevard, Moon Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15108, United States,” confirming the Hilton hotel near the airport. To compute the walking distance from the hotel to a local supermarket (e.g., Giant Eagle, a Pittsburgh-based chain), I need the hotel to be the starting point. The most efficient next step is to click the “Reverse Directions” button so that the hotel becomes the “From” location. After that, I will enter “Giant Eagle” in the “To” field, switch mode to Foot, and trigger the route calculation to read the walking distance. Since only one action is allowed per step, I will click the Reverse Directions button now.
