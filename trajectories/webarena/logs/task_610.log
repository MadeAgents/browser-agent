To start creating a new submission, I should click "Submit". Once on the submission form, I will need to select the forum "books" (as per tips: subreddit equals forum), set the Title to "To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee", leave the URL field empty, and put the comment "good book!" in the Body field, then submit the form.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is directly on the critical path to posting in r/books (forum “books”)—it’s the submission form.
- Post type radios:
  - [119] radio “URL” — checked (true)
  - [121] radio “Image” — unchecked
- Fields:
  - [127] textbox (URL) — empty
  - [137] textbox “Title” (required) — empty; currently marked “This field is required.”
  - [142] textbox “Body” — empty (where the comment “good book!” should go)
- Forum selector:
  - [383]/[384] combobox “Forum” — value “Choose one…” (no forum selected yet; needs “books”)
- Submission:
  - [400] button “Create submission” — present/visible
The form indicates that Title and Forum are required; Body is available for the review text. The current selection of “URL” suggests the URL field is shown (empty). For a text review, Title and Body should be filled and the Forum set to “books” before submitting.
