The user needs the full address of all international airports within a 50 km driving distance from Carnegie Mellon University. On OpenStreetMap, I should first locate Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Pittsburgh. Then, I should use the directions tool to measure the driving distance to nearby international airports. The most likely candidate is Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT), which I know is around 30 km from CMU; other nearby airports (Allegheny County AGC, Arnold Palmer LBE, etc.) are not international or are beyond 50 km. However, I must validate using the site’s directions feature and extract the full address from OSM. 

Steps:
1) Use the search box to find "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" to center on CMU.
2) Use "Find directions between two points" to open the directions pane and set CMU as the start.
3) Enter "Pittsburgh International Airport" as the destination and press to compute driving distance to confirm it’s within 50 km.
4) Then open the airport’s detail to retrieve the full address with zip code from OSM.

The search input is focused, so my next action is to fill it with "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" and then I will click Go in the subsequent step.

Goal: Find all international airports within 50 km driving distance from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), then provide their full addresses (including ZIP codes) from OpenStreetMap. Best approach on OSM: 
1) Search for CMU to center map and use as the origin.
2) Use the directions tool to check driving distances to candidate airports. Primary candidate is Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT); others likely outside 50 km or not international.
3) Confirm distance is within 50 km.
4) Open the airport’s details on OSM to extract the full address with ZIP code.

Objective: Identify all international airports within a 50 km driving distance from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and provide their full addresses from OpenStreetMap, including ZIP code. The best approach is to use the OSM directions panel to verify the driving distance to candidate airports and then open the airport’s detail page to extract the full address. 

Current page state: The OpenStreetMap directions panel is open with “To” already set to Carnegie Mellon University (full formal address visible in the "To" textbox [199]). The "From" field [194] is empty. Mode is set to Car (correct for driving distance). A welcome overlay is present but not blocking the directions inputs.

Plan:
1. Enter “Pittsburgh International Airport” in the “From” field and press Enter to compute the route distance/time.
2. Verify if the distance is within 50 km.
3. If within 50 km, open the airport’s POI detail to retrieve the full postal address with ZIP code.
4. Consider any other nearby international airports; likely only PIT qualifies within 50 km, but we’ll verify.

Next action: Populate the “From” field with “Pittsburgh International Airport” to calculate the route.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened OpenStreetMap and the Directions panel with driving mode set to Car.
- Set “From” to Pittsburgh International Airport (full address populated).
- Set “To” to Carnegie Mellon University (full address populated).
- Attempted to compute a route, but the routing returned an error.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is relevant and on the critical path to verifying which international airports are within a 50 km driving distance of CMU and obtaining their full addresses.
- A routing error is displayed: “Couldn't find a route between those two places.”
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Textbox “From” (id: 194): value “Pittsburgh International Airport, Coraopolis Heights Road, Westpointe Corporate Center 1, 2, 3, Moon Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15231, United States”; enabled, visible, focused.
  - Textbox “To” (id: 199): value “Carnegie Mellon University, Fifth Avenue, North Oakland, Bellefield, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15213, United States”; enabled, visible.
  - Travel mode radio “Car” (id: 173): checked.
  - Directions services combobox (id: 182): value set to “OSRM”; not expanded.
  - “Reverse Directions” button (id: 200): visible.
- The error indicates the current routing service failed, which blocks confirming driving distance.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Change the routing engine: open the “Directions services” combobox (id: 182) and select option “GraphHopper” (id: 184), then wait for the route to recalculate.
- If still no route, click “Reverse Directions” (id: 200) to swap origin/destination and trigger recalculation.
