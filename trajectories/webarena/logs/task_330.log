The user wants to know the total amount spent in March 2023 at One Stop Market. To find this, I should navigate to the user's order history. On the current homepage, there is a "My Account" link in the banner (accessibility id [227]). Clicking "My Account" will likely take me to the account dashboard where I can access "My Orders" and then identify orders from March 2023 and sum their totals. Since only one action is allowed, the best next step is to click "My Account".

✅ Current Progress: 
- Navigated to the My Account dashboard.
- Located the “Recent Orders” section and identified at least one March 2023 order (dated 3/11/23) with an order total of $65.32.
- Positioned to access the full order history to confirm all March 2023 purchases.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (“My Account”) is on the critical path to the goal of determining March 2023 spending.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link “View All” (id: 1530) — visible/enabled; opens the complete order history.
  - Table “Recent Orders” (id: 1534) — visible; shows recent orders with Date and Order Total columns. It includes an entry on 3/11/23 with a total of $65.32.
- To compute total March 2023 spending accurately, the agent should open the full orders list (via “View All”) and gather all orders from March 2023.

The user wants the total amount spent in March 2023. To ensure completeness, I should open the full order history rather than relying solely on the "Recent Orders" snapshot, which only shows a few entries and may omit other March purchases. On the My Account page, there is a "View All" link within the "Recent Orders" section (bid 1530). Clicking "View All" should navigate to the comprehensive orders list, where I can filter or visually identify all orders from March 2023 and sum their "Order Total" amounts. I previously attempted clicking a different "My Account" link and it timed out; since I'm already on the desired page, I will avoid repeating that and proceed with "View All".

✅ Current Progress: 
- Opened the full “My Orders” page.
- The orders table is visible and includes rows from March 2023.
- Positioned to extract “Order Total” values for March 2023 entries.

🔍 Current State Analysis: 
- The current page (“My Orders”) is directly on the critical path to determining March 2023 spending.
- Relevant elements (from axtree):
  - Heading “My Orders” [1468] — visible.
  - Table “Orders” [1474] with columns: “Order #” [1478], “Date” [1479], “Order Total” [1480], “Status” [1481], “Action” [1482] — visible.
  - Example row elements (showing structure and interactivity): 
    - Row with Date “5/17/23” [1486], Order Total “$365.42” [1487], Status “Canceled” [1489], Action link “View Order” [1491] — enabled.
    - Additional rows each include a “View Order” link ([1502], [1513], etc.) — enabled.
- The screenshot shows multiple March 2023 entries present in the current page of the table (dates in March are listed beneath the May entries), each with an “Order Total” in the third column.
- The page also indicates a paginated list (“Items 1 to 10 of 37 total” shown in view), so March orders may span this and/or subsequent pages.

The user asked for the total spent in March 2023. I’m on the “My Orders” page, which lists orders with Date, Order Total, and Status. I scanned the visible rows for March 2023 entries:

- 000000180 — Date: 3/11/23 — Order Total: $65.32 — Status: Complete
- 000000166 — Date: 3/10/23 — Order Total: $17.99 — Status: Complete

No other March entries appear on this page; pagination shows items 1–10 of 37 with dates descending from May to February, so March should be fully captured on page 1. I only include completed orders as actual “spend.” Summing $65.32 + $17.99 = $83.31.

Per instruction, when asked “how much is spent,” I should return just the decimal number without a currency symbol.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the “My Orders” page and located the orders table.
- Identified some March 2023 entries but a final total (“83.31”) was sent prematurely without confirming all March orders.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (“My Orders”) is directly relevant to the goal.
- Key elements:
  - Table “Orders” [1474] with columns: “Date” [1479], “Order Total” [1480], “Status” [1481] — visible and readable.
  - Each row includes a “View Order” link (e.g., [1491], [1502], [1513]) — enabled.
  - Pagination is present (“Items 1 to 10 of 37 total” shown), indicating more rows may need review to capture all March 2023 orders.
- Several March 2023 entries are visible in the table; at least one additional March date beyond 3/10 and 3/11 appears (e.g., 3/2/23), so the previously sent total is likely incomplete.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Scroll the “Orders” table [1474] and record the “Order Total” values for every row with a Date in March 2023; include only rows whose “Status” is “Complete” [1481], then sum them.
- If not all March rows are visible, use the pagination controls at the bottom of the table (the “Show … per page” control next to the “Items 1 to 10 of 37 total” text) to display more rows and repeat the check.
