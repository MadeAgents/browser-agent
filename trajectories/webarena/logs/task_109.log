The user needs monthly counts of successful orders for January through December 2022 in the MM:COUNT format. On Magento, this is typically done via Reports > Sales > Orders, where we can set:
- Period = Month
- Date range = From 01/01/2022 to 12/31/2022 (or To 01/01/2023, depending on inclusive/exclusive handling)
- Order Status = Specified, with "Complete" chosen (commonly representing successful orders)
- Show report to get monthly breakdown.

From the current Dashboard page, I should navigate to the REPORTS section first. The left/top navigation shows a "REPORTS" link with bid 339. Clicking it is the appropriate next step to reach the reports menu before selecting the specific Orders report and applying filters. I'll click the REPORTS menu item to proceed.

The user needs the monthly count of successful orders for Jan–Dec 2022 in MM:COUNT format. In Magento, this can be obtained via Reports > Sales > Orders, where we can filter by date range, set the Period to Month, and choose an order status representing successful orders (commonly "Complete"). The current page shows the Reports overlay with the "Orders" link under Sales (bid 383). The next logical step is to click "Orders" to open the Sales Orders report page, after which I will set:

- To = 12/31/2022 (or 01/01/2023 if the UI requires exclusive end date)

✅ Current Progress: Reached the Orders Report page and configured filters: Period set to “Month”; date range filled From [769] = 01/01/2022 and To [776] = 12/31/2022; Order Status switched to “Specified”.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is directly relevant and on the critical path to the goal of obtaining monthly successful order counts for 2022. Key interactive elements:
- [753] combobox “Date Used” = “Order Created” (visible, enabled).
- [761] combobox “Period” = “Month” (visible, enabled; correct for monthly aggregation).
- [769] textbox “From *” = “01/01/2022” (required, filled).
- [776] textbox “To *” = “12/31/2022” (required, filled).
- [783] combobox “Order Status” = “Specified” (visible, enabled).
- [791] listbox (multiselect) for statuses (e.g., Canceled, Closed, Complete, Processing, etc.) — currently no status selected (all options unselected). For “successful” orders, “Complete” should be selected here.
- [805] combobox “Empty Rows” = “No” (enabled; switching to “Yes” would include zero-count months).
- [812] combobox “Show Actual Values” = “No” (enabled).
- [726] button “Show Report” (visible, enabled).
- Results grid shows “0 records found,” indicating the report hasn’t been run with a valid status selection yet.

Goal: Provide monthly counts of successful (Complete) orders from Jan–Dec 2022 in MM:COUNT format.

Current page: Orders Report with filters visible. Period = Month, From = 01/01/2022, To = 12/31/2022, Order Status = Specified, and a status listbox is shown. To get “successful” orders, I should select the “Complete” status from the list and then run the report. Because only one action is allowed per step, the immediate next step is to select the “Complete” option. The list appears to be ordered starting with “Canceled”, “Closed”, then “Complete” (third item). In the accessibility tree, the options are [792] to [800]. Based on typical ordering and the screenshot, [794] should correspond to “Complete”. I will click that option to select it.
