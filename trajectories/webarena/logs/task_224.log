The user needs the driving time from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Pittsburgh to the nearest Wendy's. On the OpenStreetMap interface, the best way is to use the directions feature. The accessibility tree shows a link labeled "Find directions between two points" with bid 167, which corresponds to the two-arrows directions button near the "Go" button. Clicking this should open the A-to-B route planner where I can input the start (CMU Pittsburgh) and destination (Wendy's), and then calculate driving directions and time. The current map is centered around Hong Kong, but that's fine because the directions tool can accept place names directly. The next logical step is to open the directions pane by clicking that link.

- Current route summary shows Distance 3883 km and Time 42:59 (summary row [495] with values [497]=“3883km”, [498]=“42:59”).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page is on a directions tool, but the destination is not the nearest Wendy’s to CMU. It is a far-away location in California, so the result is off-target for the goal.

  - Radio “Car” [173]: checked (enabled/visible).
  - Combobox “Directions services” [182]: value=“OSRM” (collapsed, enabled).
  - Textbox “From” [194]: filled with CMU address (enabled/visible).

  - “Reverse Directions” button [200]: visible/enabled.
  - Route summary [495]: displays distance/time, confirming a route is computed but not to the nearest location.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Replace the incorrect destination with a local query to find a nearby Wendy’s, then recalculate:
  1) Type "Wendy's, Pittsburgh, PA" into the “To” textbox [199].
  2) Press Enter on [199] to update the route.

 <think>
The user asks how long it takes to drive from CMU Pittsburgh to the nearest Wendy’s. We are on the OpenStreetMap Directions page with mode set to Car. The “From” field is CMU’s full address and the “To” field is set to “Wendy’s, 2410, West Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15226, United States.” The directions summary shows Distance: 10km and Time: 0:13. Since the user only asked for the time, the concise answer is “13 minutes.” No further interaction is required; the best next step is to send this answer back to the user.
