The user asks how much they spent on 4/19/2023 at One Stop Market. To find this, I should navigate to their order history. The page shows a "My Account" link at the top (bid 227), and the task tips specify that previous purchases can be found via My Account > My Orders. So the next logical step is to click "My Account" to access account options, then proceed to My Orders, and filter/find orders on 4/19/2023 and sum totals. First, I will click the My Account link.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal, as order history is accessible here. Relevant elements:
- Link 'View All' (id: 1530) — visible; should open the full order history beyond the limited Recent Orders list.
- Table 'Recent Orders' (id: 1534) — visible; lists a few recent orders with dates, but 4/19/2023 is not shown here.

The user asks for how much they spent on 4/19/2023 at One Stop Market. I’m currently on the “My Account” page, which shows a Recent Orders table but does not include any orders on 4/19/2023. To find all orders and be able to filter/locate the specific date, I should navigate to the full order history. The left-side navigation includes a “My Orders” link (bid 1614), which is the correct path per the task tips (My Account > My Orders). Clicking “My Orders” should show a complete list where I can find any orders from 4/19/2023 and then sum the totals if multiple orders exist on that date. The previous attempted click on the top "My Account" link timed out and is unnecessary now since I'm already on the My Account page. Therefore, the best next step is to click the "My Orders" link (bid 1614).

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “My Orders” page and loaded the Orders table. Order entries are visible with dates and totals, but no row for 4/19/2023 has been located yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to determine spending on a specific date. Key elements:
- Table “Orders” (table id: 1474) with columns “Order #”, “Date”, “Order Total”, “Status”, and “Action” is visible and populated.
- Visible rows include:
  - Date “5/17/23” with Order Total “$365.42” and an enabled “View Order” link (id: 1491).
  - Date “5/2/23” with Order Total “$754.99” and an enabled “View Order” link (id: 1502).
  - Date “5/2/23” with Order Total “$2,004.99” and an enabled “View Order” link (id: 1513).
- Additional rows are present below (row id 1517 and onward in the axtree), suggesting more orders beyond those listed above.
- The target date “4/19/23” is not among the currently visible rows; locating it likely requires navigating through the remaining rows of the Orders table.
- Non-essential elements for this task (e.g., combobox “Search” id: 380 and disabled “Search” button id: 385) are present but irrelevant.

The user wants the amount spent on 4/19/2023. I’m on the “My Orders” page showing a paginated Orders table with dates and totals. Page 1 lists 10 orders from 5/17/23 down to 2/9/23, which suggests the list is sorted descending by date.

To be thorough and confirm there isn’t an order for 4/19/23, I should check the next page of orders. If the list is strictly descending, page 2 will contain dates older than 2/9/23 and thus cannot include 4/19/23, but verifying page 2 will confirm the absence.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the “My Orders” page and navigated to page 2 of the Orders table, showing older orders (Jan 2023 to Oct 2022). The target date 4/19/2023 has not been found yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is relevant to the goal, but the current pagination view is not showing the needed date.
- Orders table “Orders” (id: 1474) is visible with columns Order #, Date, Order Total, Status, Action.
- Visible rows on the current page include dates such as 1/29/23, 1/16/23, 12/18/22, etc., each with an enabled “View Order” link (e.g., link text “View Order”, ids like 1491/1502/1513 on this page).
- Pagination controls are present; link “1” (marker near id 1605 in the screenshot) returns to the most recent orders. Link “2” (id 1606) is the current page.
- Since 4/19/2023 is more recent than the dates shown, it should be on page 1. Current view is slightly off the target.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click pagination link “1” (page 1, id 1605) to return to the most recent orders.
- In table “Orders” (id 1474), locate the row with Date “4/19/23” and read its “Order Total”; if needed, click the “View Order” link in that row (link text “View Order”) to confirm the amount.
