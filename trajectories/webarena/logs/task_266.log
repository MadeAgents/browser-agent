The user asks for the closest national park to the largest city in Maine. The largest city in Maine is Portland. Maine’s only national park is Acadia National Park, located on Mount Desert Island near Bar Harbor, which is the nearest national park to Portland. Given the instruction to keep responses concise and that this is a straightforward fact, I will provide the answer directly using send_msg_to_user.
