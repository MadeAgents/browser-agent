The user needs the name of a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport and the minimal driving time to a supermarket from that hotel. I should use OpenStreetMap’s search to navigate to Pittsburgh and then identify a nearby Hyatt. The search box is focused (bid 162). The current map is centered around Hong Kong, so I must search for "Pittsburgh International Airport" to move to the Pittsburgh area. After locating the airport, I can search for “Hyatt” nearby or search specifically for “Hyatt Pittsburgh Airport” to find a Hyatt hotel in the vicinity. Once I identify a Hyatt hotel, I will get directions from that hotel to a nearby supermarket using the “Find directions between two points” (two arrows) button next to the Go button. The directions tool typically has options for travel mode and will display a time estimate; I need to ensure I choose “Car” and then find a supermarket destination (e.g., “Giant Eagle,” “Walmart,” “Aldi,” etc.) and compare route options if multiple are shown to determine the minimal driving time. First step: search for “Pittsburgh International Airport” via the Search field and hit Go to reposition the map to Pittsburgh.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap, which is suitable for finding nearby venues and estimating driving times. The map view is not yet centered on Pittsburgh; it still shows a general world/other region view. Relevant interactive elements:
- Textbox labeled “Search” [162]: focused, filled with “Pittsburgh International Airport”.
- Button “Go” [165]: visible; expected to trigger the search to center on the airport.
- Link “Find directions between two points” [167]: visible; will be used after locating a Hyatt hotel to calculate driving time to a supermarket.
- Map tools: “Zoom In” [434], “Zoom Out” [436], “Query features” [454], and others; useful after the search completes to refine and identify nearby hotels/supermarkets.

The user wants the name of a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport and the minimal driving time to a supermarket from that hotel. We are on OpenStreetMap with search results for the airport already shown. To identify a Hyatt hotel in the vicinity, the most efficient approach is to use the search box rather than scanning the map. The search textbox [162] is visible and currently contains “Pittsburgh International Airport.” I should replace it with a targeted query for “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport,” which is the likely Hyatt hotel at or near the airport, and then run the search. After confirming the hotel result, I can use the directions tool to compute driving time to a supermarket. The immediate next action is to fill the search box with the Hyatt query.

We are on OpenStreetMap’s directions page with the “Car” mode selected and the “From” field already populated with “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport, 1111, Airport Boulevard, Findlay Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15231, United States,” confirming the nearby Hyatt hotel. The user also wants the minimal driving time to a supermarket from this hotel. The next step is to set a destination as a supermarket. The “To” textbox [199] is empty. I should input a generic term like “supermarket” to let OSM find the nearest supermarket destination. After entering it, I may need to submit (e.g., press Enter) to compute the route, but the immediate next action is to fill the “To” field.

  - Button “Reverse Directions” [200] — visible; not required since origin is already the hotel.

The user wants: (1) the name of a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport, and (2) the minimal driving time to a supermarket from that hotel. I’m on OpenStreetMap’s directions page. From the accessibility tree and screenshot, the directions panel is open with:
- Mode: Car (radio checked)
- From: “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport, 1111, Airport Boulevard, Findlay Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15231, United States” (confirming the Hyatt name and full address)
- To: “supermarket” (textbox [199]) is filled and focused.

To compute the route and get the time estimate, I need to execute the directions query. There’s no visible “Go” submit button inside the directions panel; typically OSM computes when pressing Enter in the To field or when selecting a result. Based on the environment’s tips and available actions, using the press action to submit (press Enter on the To field) is appropriate. This should generate one or more routes and display the travel time(s), from which I can extract the minimal driving time. Therefore, the next step is to press Enter on the “To” textbox (bid 199) to compute the route.

Goal: Provide the name of a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport and the minimal driving time to a supermarket from that hotel. The current OSM directions panel shows From: Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport (correct), but To: “Supermarket, Monrovia, Liberia,” causing “Couldn't find a route.” I need to correct the destination to a nearby supermarket in Pittsburgh. To avoid the geocoder picking a faraway generic “Supermarket,” I should specify a known nearby supermarket with locality context.
