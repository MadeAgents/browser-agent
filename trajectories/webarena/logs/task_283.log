The user wants to find the most recent models of Xbox controllers released between 2020-2021. On the One Stop Market homepage, there is a top search bar (combobox element [273]) and a disabled Search button that likely becomes active after entering a query. Using the search bar is the fastest way to locate Xbox controllers rather than navigating categories. My next step is to enter the query "Xbox controller" into the search input to bring up relevant products, after which I can review results and look for models and any release information. I'll perform the fill action on the search combobox.

✅ Current Progress: Search submitted for “Xbox controller”; arrived on the search results page showing a product grid with controllers and accessories.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to identifying recent Xbox controller models (2020–2021).
Relevant interactive elements visible and enabled:
- Search field: combobox labeled “Search” (id 274), value “Xbox controller”; Search button (id 279) currently disabled.
- Sorting: “Sort By” combobox (id 1388) set to “Relevance” (options: Product Name, Price); “Set Ascending Direction” link (id 1392).
- Related search terms (useful to narrow to official models):
  - Link “xbox one console” (id 1397)
  - Link “xbox series x” (id 1399)
  - Link “xbox one x” (id 1401)
  - Link containing “Xbox Wireless Controller … Series X|S …” (id 1403)
- Product result links (clickable titles in the grid):
  - “Microsoft Xbox Controller (Carbon Black) … Series X|S …” (marker id 1410)
  - “Xbox Wireless Controller - Phantom Magenta Special Edition - Xbox One” (marker id 1729)
- View controls: “View as List” link (id 1380).
The result grid (Items 1–12 of 12660) is broad; focusing on official “Xbox Wireless Controller” items (Series X|S, special editions from 2020–2021) will be key to extract release-year details.

The user wants the most recent Xbox controller models from 2020–2021. I’m on the search results page for “Xbox controller,” which shows a broad mix of accessories and controllers (12660 items). To efficiently narrow down to official Microsoft Xbox Wireless Controller models for Series X|S (which launched in 2020 and had several color variants in 2020–2021), I should leverage the Related search terms shown near the top. One of the related links includes “Xbox Wireless Controller … Series X|S … Shock Blue,” which likely filters directly to the correct product family and variants (e.g., Carbon Black, Robot White, Shock Blue, and potentially 2021 colors). Clicking that related term is faster than trying to scroll or browse categories and adheres to the tip of using filters/search to narrow results.

- Click link with visible text “xbox series x” (id 1400) to constrain results to the current-generation controllers introduced in 2020.
- Then, replace the query in the Search field (combobox id 275) with “Xbox Wireless Controller release date 2020 2021” to surface items/pages that may mention release timing. If the Search button (id 280) becomes enabled, click it to run the refined query.

  - Sort By combobox (id 1389) set to “Relevance”.
  - Results grid shows many mixed/older or accessory items (e.g., renewed Xbox One-era controllers, tool kits), not directly indicating 2020–2021 model releases.
- Assessment: Off-track for determining the most recent 2020–2021 Xbox controller models; need to narrow to Series X|S-era controllers or a specific Microsoft model page.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the related search term link “xbox series x” (id 1400) to constrain results to the current generation (2020+).
- If still broad, click the “Advanced Search” link (id 278) and use a targeted query (e.g., “Xbox Wireless Controller Series X|S Shock Blue”) to reach a specific product detail page that may list model/version info.

The goal is to identify the most recent Xbox controller models released between 2020–2021. The current search results page is extremely broad (23,418 items) and mixes many unrelated accessories. To efficiently narrow down to relevant products, I should use the on-page filters rather than scrolling or relying on a disabled search button. In the “Shop By” section, there is a “Video Games (761 item)” category filter link, which will drastically reduce the result set and focus on gaming-related products, including controllers. Applying this filter aligns with the guidance to use filters to narrow results and should make it easier to find official Microsoft Xbox Wireless Controller Series X|S variants from 2020–2021 (e.g., Carbon Black, Robot White, Shock Blue, Electric Volt, Pulse Red, Aqua Shift, Daystrike Camo).

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened a search results page for “Xbox Wireless ControllerMicrosoft Xbox Wireless Controller Shock Blue.”
- Applied the “Video Games” filter (“Now Shopping By: Category > Video Games”), reducing results to 761 items.
- No concrete identification of 2020–2021 Xbox controller models yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is related but still broad for the research goal (identifying most recent Xbox controller models from 2020–2021). It mixes controllers and accessories; a tighter filter to Series X|S-era “Xbox Wireless Controller” variants is needed.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Search input: combobox labeled “Search” (value shows the current query), visible; Search button “Search” (disabled).
  - “Related search terms” links (visible/enabled):
    - “xbox series x”
    - “xbox one”
    - “xbox wireless controller”
    - “Xbox Wireless Controller Xbox Wireless Controller Series X|S Microsoft Xbox Wireless Controller Shock Blue”
  - Sorting: “Sort By” combobox (currently “Relevance”), visible/enabled.
  - Left filters: “Shopping Options” > “Category” links (e.g., “Xbox One”, “PlayStation 3”, “Xbox 360 Systems”, “Nintendo Switch”), visible/enabled.
- Assessment: Still off-track for pinpointing 2020–2021 models; need to refine to Series X|S “Xbox Wireless Controller” variants where those 2020–2021 colors/models appear.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the link labeled “xbox wireless controller” under “Related search terms” to focus results on controllers.
- Then click the related search term “Xbox Wireless Controller … Series X|S … Microsoft Xbox Wireless Controller Shock Blue” to constrain to the Series X|S-generation controllers (2020+).

The user wants the most recent models of Xbox controllers released between 2020–2021. We’re on a search results page filtered to “Video Games,” but the current grid shows a broad mix of controllers and accessories, not specifically the latest Series X|S-era controllers. The “Related search terms” section offers targeted links that can quickly narrow to relevant results. In particular, there’s a link labeled “Xbox Wireless ControllerXbox Wireless Controller Series X|SMicrosoft Xbox Wireless Controller Shock Blue,” which directly references the Series X|S generation and a known 2020 color (Shock Blue). Clicking this should refine the results to the Series X|S Xbox Wireless Controller lineup, where the 2020–2021 models (Carbon Black, Robot White, Shock Blue, Pulse Red, Electric Volt, Daystrike Camo, Aqua Shift) are likely present. This aligns with the guidance to use filters/search rather than scrolling. I will click that related term link to narrow the results appropriately.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened a search results page for “Xbox Wireless Controller Xbox Wireless Controller Series X|S Microsoft Xbox Wireless Controller Shock Blue.”
- Results are visible, but no specific 2020–2021 model list has been identified yet.
- Previously applied a “Video Games” filter, but it appears no longer active (results show 1–12 of 82,325).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is related to the goal but overly broad; it mixes controllers and many accessories, making it harder to identify 2020–2021 models.
- Key interactive elements:
  - Search input: combobox labeled “Search” (id 275), currently filled with the long query; Search button (id 280) is disabled.
  - Related search terms (visible/enabled):
    - Link “xbox wireless controller” (id 1404).
    - Link “Microsoft Xbox Wireless Controller Shock Blue” (id 1406).
  - Sorting: “Sort By” combobox (id 1389), set to “Relevance,” enabled.
  - Left “Shop By” category filter: “Video Games” link (previously id 1922), visible/enabled in the sidebar.
- Assessment: On-topic but not tightly scoped. The result set is too large and unfocused for extracting the 2020–2021 controller models. Refinement is needed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the related search term link with visible text “xbox wireless controller” (id 1404) to narrow to the core controller lineup.
- Apply the “Video Games” filter by clicking the sidebar link labeled “Video Games” (id 1922) to limit results to gaming products only.

Objective: Identify the most recent Xbox controller models released between 2020–2021 using the current website. The current page is a very broad search results page with many unrelated accessories. Among the visible product tiles, there is a direct link to “Microsoft Xbox Controller (Carbon Black) for Series X, Series S, Xbox One...” which is part of the 2020 Series X|S controller lineup. Clicking this product page is a strategic next step because product pages often contain related or variant color links that can reveal other 2020–2021 models (e.g., Robot White, Shock Blue, Pulse Red, Electric Volt, Daystrike Camo, Aqua Shift). This aligns with narrowing the search via direct relevant product navigation rather than browsing thousands of results without scrolling. So I will click the Carbon Black product link to access potentially more detailed model info and variant links.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to a relevant product page: “Microsoft Xbox Controller (Carbon Black) for Series X, Series S, Xbox One, Windows 10, Android & iOS.”
- Identified one specific controller model (Carbon Black), but no consolidated list of 2020–2021 models yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is on-topic but focuses on a single product; it does not present a list of Xbox controller models released in 2020–2021.
- Relevant interactive elements for progressing:
  - Search combobox labeled “Search” [306], visible, currently empty; associated “Search” button [311] is disabled.
  - “Advanced Search” link [309], visible and enabled.
  - Top navigation “Video Games” menu item [1109], visible, hasPopup=menu (can be used to navigate to controller listings).
  - On-page actions (not essential to the goal): “Add to Cart” button [1435], enabled; “Qty” spinbutton [1433], value=1; “Add to Wish List” link [1440], enabled; “Add to Compare” link [1442], enabled.
- Page content includes product details and a “Product Quick Look,” but no clear release-year metadata for model identification; a “Date First Available” is shown (December 16, 2022) which is site availability, not a comprehensive model release list.
- Assessment: On the critical path but needs navigation to a broader listing or search refinement to enumerate 2020–2021 models (e.g., Carbon Black, Robot White, Shock Blue, Pulse Red, Electric Volt, Daystrike Camo, Aqua Shift).
