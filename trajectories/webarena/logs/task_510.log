The user wants to buy the best-rated product from the "Home Audio Speaker" category with at least 5 reviews and the least expensive. To reach the correct category, I should use the top navigation menu. The page shows a vertical menu with multiple categories, including "Electronics" (bid 816). According to the tips, I should hover over nested dropdown menus to reveal subcategories rather than using search.

✅ Current Progress: Expanded the “Electronics” category menu via hover, revealing its subcategories.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current homepage is on the critical path because the top navigation allows access to the “Home Audio” category. The axtree shows:
- menuitem “Electronics” (id: 816) — visible; its submenu is open.
- menuitem “Home Audio” (id: 821) — visible; hasPopup='menu' (submenu not yet expanded).
- Other subcategory items under Electronics (e.g., “Video Projectors” id: 841) are visible but not relevant to the goal.
- Search button (id: 278) — disabled; not useful for progressing right now.

The essential next interaction is within the “Home Audio” submenu to locate the “Speaker” category; this submenu has not yet been expanded.

I am already on the Speakers category page, sorted by Price (ascending), per the URL and the “Sort By” combobox value.

Among products with at least 5 reviews, the highest rating is 94% (Atlantic Technology, 7 reviews). Since that’s the best rating among qualifying items, it satisfies the primary criterion; and because it appears to be uniquely highest-rated in this set, it is trivially the least expensive among the best-rated group. The add-to-cart button for that product is within its list item (bid 1727). To proceed with purchase, I should click “Add to Cart” for this product.

The user’s goal is to buy the best-rated product from the Home Audio Speakers category with at least 5 reviews and, among the best-rated items, choose the least expensive. I navigated via the Electronics → Home Audio → Speakers menu, sorted by Price, and identified that the “Atlantic Technology FS-7.0-GLB 7-channel Surround Bar” has a 94% rating with 7 reviews and meets the criteria. I added it to the cart, and now I’m on the Shopping Cart page showing this item with Qty=1 and totals. The next step to complete the purchase is to proceed to checkout. The “Proceed to Checkout” button is visible and enabled (bid 1907). I will click it to move forward in the checkout process.
