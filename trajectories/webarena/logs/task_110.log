The user needs monthly counts of successful orders from Jan to Nov 2022 in MM:COUNT format. In Magento, this is typically retrieved via Reports > Sales > Orders, where we can set a date range, select "Show By: Month," and filter by Order Status. "Successful orders" are usually those with "Complete" status. The benchmark tips also mention the Reports > Orders page and the unique 1-of-n selection UI for Order Status (so we should select "Specified" and then choose a specific status like "Complete").

Current page is the Dashboard. To access the needed report, I should navigate to the REPORTS menu. From there, I expect options for Sales or Orders. The first action should be to click the "REPORTS" top navigation link (bid 339) to open the Reports section. Then I can proceed to select the Orders report and configure filters.

I will click the REPORTS menu now.

1) Change Period from Day to Month so the report aggregates by month.
2) Set the date range From 01/01/2022 to 11/30/2022 to cover Jan–Nov 2022.
3) For "successful orders," in Magento this typically corresponds to "Complete" status. The tips mention using the Orders report and the 1-of-n selection UI under Order Status when "Specified" is chosen; thus I should set Order Status to Specified and pick "Complete".
4) Set "Empty Rows" to Yes to include months with zero orders if any.
5) Click Show Report and then read the Orders column for each monthly interval.
6) Finally, present results in MM:COUNT format.

Currently, the Period combobox (761) is expanded with options Day (selected), Month (763), Year (764). The next logical step is to select “Month” (option 763). After that, I will fill in the dates and adjust statuses.

The goal is to present monthly counts of successful orders from Jan to Nov 2022. On the Orders Report page, the Period is already set to Month and the From date is 01/01/2022. The To date is currently empty and is required, which is likely why the report shows "0 records found." To proceed, I should first fill the To date with 11/30/2022 to cover Jan–Nov 2022. After that, I will set Order Status to Specified and select "Complete" (representing successful orders), then click Show Report and read the monthly counts. For now, the best next single action is to fill the To date field.

- The results table shows “11 records found” (monthly intervals Jan–Nov 2022) with an “Orders” column. However, “successful orders” have not yet been constrained to a specific status (e.g., “Complete”), so the current counts may include multiple statuses rather than strictly successful ones.

Goal: Present the monthly count of successful orders (interpreted as “Complete” status) from Jan to Nov 2022 in MM:COUNT format.

Current page: Orders Report with filter controls visible and results table showing 11 records (Jan–Nov 2022). Filters show:
- Date Used = Order Created
- Period = Month
- From = 1/1/22
- To = 11/30/22
- Order Status = Specified (1-of-n selection list visible)
The listbox entries are present but unnamed in the accessibility tree (options [792]–[800]). Based on the visual order in the screenshot (Canceled, Closed, Complete, ...), the 3rd option corresponds to “Complete.” In the accessibility tree, that should map to the third option element, which is bid 794. To ensure the report counts only “successful” (Complete) orders, I should select that option, then click “Show Report” to refresh the results. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best action is to click the third option in the Order Status listbox (bid 794) to select “Complete.” After that succeeds, I will click “Show Report” and extract the counts from the Orders column for each month.
