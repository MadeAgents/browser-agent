The user wants me to update the project site's title to "Not an interesting site". On GitLab, this likely means editing the HTML title tag in index.html of the repository. I'm currently on the project overview page for gimmiethat.space, and I can see a file list including index.html with a link element [991]. The proper next step is to open index.html so I can then edit it. After opening, I will look for an Edit button to modify the title tag, then commit the change to the main branch, as per the tips. For now, the single action should be clicking the index.html link.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to update the site title. You are viewing index.html on branch “main,” and the file toolbar is visible above the code viewer.
- Relevant elements (from axtree):
  - [1149] link 'index.html' (Files breadcrumb) — confirms the file currently open.
  - [739] button 'main' (branch selector, expanded=False) — indicates target branch for committing changes.
  - [1151] link 'Find file', [1153] link 'Blame', [1155] link 'History' — navigation actions (not needed for editing).
  - [1146] button 'Copy commit SHA' — informational, not needed for editing.
- From the screenshot: toolbar buttons “Edit” (pencil) and “Open in Web IDE” are visible and appear enabled; these are the controls needed to modify index.html and commit the change.
- Non-blocking notices: SSH key alert banner is unrelated to editing via the web UI.

The user wants the project site's title updated to "Not an interesting site". This requires editing the HTML <title> tag in index.html of the repository and committing the change to the main branch. I’m currently on the file view for index.html in the gimmiethat.space repo (branch: main). To modify the file in GitLab’s UI, I typically need to click an Edit option. In the toolbar above the code, I see "Open in Web IDE" [1188] and a "Toggle dropdown" button [1190]. On GitLab, the caret dropdown next to "Open in Web IDE" often contains a direct "Edit" option for quick edits. Therefore, the next best step is to click the "Toggle dropdown" [1190] to reveal the edit option. After that, I’ll select Edit, change the <title> content from "Welcome to my site" to "Not an interesting site", and commit to main.

Task: Update the site's title to "Not an interesting site" by editing index.html in the gimmiethat.space repo on the main branch and committing the change.

Current state: I navigated to the file view for index.html and opened the “Edit” action via the dropdown. To proceed reliably without depending on potentially changing element IDs for the editor, a robust approach is to directly navigate to the edit URL for the file. On GitLab, replacing "blob" with "edit" in the URL opens the single-file editor. This will bring up the editable text area and the commit interface, enabling me to modify the <title> tag.

Plan:
1. Navigate to the edit URL: /-/edit/main/index.html
2. Locate the editor text area and change <title>Welcome to my site</title> to <title>Not an interesting site</title>.
3. Enter a commit message and commit to main.

Next best single action: Use goto to open the edit page directly.

The user wants the project site's title updated to "Not an interesting site" in index.html. I’m on the GitLab single-file editor page for index.html on the main branch. The editor shows the title tag "<title>Welcome to my site</title>", and the Find widget is open with "Welcome to my site" already located (1 of 1). To safely change only the title text without risking overwriting the entire file, the best path is to use the editor’s Find/Replace functionality. I see the "Toggle Replace" control [1867], currently collapsed (expanded=False). The next step is to expand it so I can input the replacement text "Not an interesting site" and perform the replacement, then commit. Therefore, I will click the "Toggle Replace" button to open the replace input.
