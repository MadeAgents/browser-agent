The user asks: "How many commits did kilian make on 3/5/2023?" We are on the project's main page for The A11Y Project repository in GitLab. To find commit counts for a specific date by a specific author, the most straightforward path is to navigate to the repository's commits page. There's a "2,320 Commits" link in the project header ([687]) that should lead to a list of commits, possibly with filtering options or at least a chronological list where I can locate March 5, 2023 and look for commits by author "kilian". Since scrolling is not supported, it's better to use navigational links and then look for filtering tools on the commits page (e.g., search box, filter by author), or a date grouping. The first step is to click the "2,320 Commits" link to access the commits history. Then I can evaluate available filters to narrow to author and date. So I'll click that link now.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the repository’s Commits page for the main branch. No author/date filtering has been applied yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to answer how many commits “kilian” made on 3/5/2023. The commit history is shown grouped by date (e.g., “14 Mar, 2023 — 2 commits” is visible), and March 2023 entries are present further down the list.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Button labeled “Author” (id: [800], hasPopup=menu, expanded=false, visible/enabled). This is the key control to filter commits by a specific author (e.g., “kilian”).
  - Search box labeled “Search by message” (id: [842], visible, empty). Useful for message text but not for author filtering.
  - Commits list (container id: [847]) with date-group listitems (e.g., [848] shows “14 Mar, 2023 — 2 commits”). Scrolling within this list should reveal “05 Mar, 2023” and its commit entries.
  - Branch selector “main” (id: [588], visible, expanded=false). Currently set to the intended branch.
No issues detected; the page is appropriate for identifying the count for 03/05/2023 by filtering to author “kilian” and checking that date’s group.

The user asks for the number of commits by "kilian" on 3/5/2023. On the current GitLab Commits page for the repository, commits are grouped by date. I examined the visible entries and found the date group "05 Mar, 2023" which shows "1 commit." Within that group, the single commit is authored by "Kilian Valkhof" at "Mar 5, 2023 7:47pm GMT." Therefore, the number of commits by Kilian on that date is 1. No further navigation or filtering is needed.

✅ Current Progress: 
- Navigated to the repository’s Commits page on branch “main.”
- Located the date group for “05 Mar, 2023” showing “1 commit.”
- No author filter has been applied yet to confirm the commit was by “kilian.”

🔍 Current State Analysis: 
- The current page is directly relevant to the goal (commit history by date/author).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Branch selector button “main” (id: [588]) — visible, enabled, expanded=false.
  - Author filter button “Author” (id: [800]) — visible, enabled, expanded=false (not applied).
  - Search box “Search by message” (id: [842]) — visible, empty.
  - Commits list container (id: [847]) — visible; includes grouped entries by date. The group for “05 Mar, 2023” shows “1 commit.”
- To answer specifically “how many commits did kilian make,” the author must be verified. Currently, the page shows the count for that date but without an applied author filter, the association to “kilian” is not yet confirmed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the Author filter button (id: [800]) and select “Kilian Valkhof” to filter by author.
- After filtering, scroll within the commits list (id: [847]) to the “05 Mar, 2023” group and confirm the header’s count (expected: “1 commit”).
