The user wants to change the LICENSE of the repository byteblaze/cloud-to-butt to the MIT license. I’m on the GitLab dashboard displaying a list of projects. Since scrolling is discouraged and inefficient, I should use the page’s “Filter by name” searchbox to quickly find the specific repository. The accessibility tree shows a searchbox labeled "Filter by name" with bid [273]. The plan is:
1) Use the filter to search for "cloud-to-butt".
2) Then select the matching project from the filtered list.
After that, I can navigate to the repository, locate the LICENSE file, edit it to MIT license text, and commit to main. For now, the next best single action is to fill the filter with "cloud-to-butt".

The user’s goal is to set the repository’s LICENSE to MIT. I’m on the project’s main page for byteblaze/cloud-to-butt, with the file list visible, including a row for LICENSE (bid 973). The branch selector shows “master,” which aligns with the instruction that “main often means master” in this environment. The most straightforward next step is to open the LICENSE file to inspect and then edit it to the MIT template. From the file list table, clicking the “LICENSE” link should navigate to the file view page where an Edit button (or “Open in Web IDE”/“Edit” options) will be available. I will click the LICENSE file link now.
