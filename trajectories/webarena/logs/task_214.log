The user's goal is to identify what customers don’t like about the Zing Jump Rope. I need to review multiple customer reviews for this product to extract any negative feedback. I’m currently on the “Edit Review” page for Zing Jump Rope (URL shows id/150), and the content here is positive with no complaints. The previous attempt to click a “Next” button (bid 719) failed; the accessible toolbar shows there is no “Next” on this page—only “Back,” “Previous,” “Save and Previous,” and “Save Review.” To continue examining other reviews without returning to the list, the most logical step is to use the “Previous” button (bid 713), which should navigate to the previous review in the filtered set of Zing Jump Rope reviews. This will allow me to check the next piece of feedback for any negative aspects. I will click “Previous.”
