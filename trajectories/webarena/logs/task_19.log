The user wants a comparison of the time for walking and driving routes between Carnegie Science Center and Carnegie Mellon University. On OpenStreetMap, the way to get directions is to use the "Find directions between two points" control, which appears as the two-arrow button next to the Go button. The Accessibility Tree shows a link labeled "Find directions between two points" (bid 167). The next step is to click this to open the directions panel where I can input the start and end locations and then check times for different transport modes (driving and walking).

 <think>
The user asked to compare walking and driving times between Carnegie Science Center and Carnegie Mellon University. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already populated with the correct origin and destination. The current mode is Foot (radio [179] checked), and the summary shows Distance 7.8km and Time 1:44. Earlier, when Car mode was active, the results displayed Time 0:12 and Distance 8.4km. Since the task is to report the comparison, the best next step is to send the concise answer with both times. No further UI interaction is needed.
