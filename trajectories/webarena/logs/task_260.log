The user wants to browse products in the Video Games category. The homepage shows a vertical navigation menu with various categories, including a menuitem labeled "Video Games" (bid 1189) that has a popup menu available, suggesting subcategories may appear on hover. Following the general tip to use dropdown menus and hover to reveal nested options, the next step is to hover over "Video Games" to reveal any subcategories or to enable clicking into the main category. After hovering, I can click the appropriate link to open the category page. So the immediate action is to hover over the Video Games menu item.

The user wants to browse products in the Video Game category. The homepage has a vertical navigation menu with a "Video Games" menu item (bid 1189) that shows a submenu when hovered. I already hovered over it, and the submenu with platform-specific subcategories appeared. To reach the general Video Games category page (rather than a specific subcategory), the best next step is to click on the main "Video Games" menu item itself, which should navigate to the category listing page with all related products.
