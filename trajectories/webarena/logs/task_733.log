The user wants me to edit their post about the "Star Trek Starfleet Academy series" and add a line to the body. First, I need to locate that specific post. The homepage shows a search bar at the top (a faster way than scrolling). I should use the search bar to find the post by its title. The search field is visible in the red header and is tagged with SOM id 53 in the screenshot. My plan:
1) Enter "Star Trek Starfleet Academy series" into the search box.
2) Submit the search (likely by pressing Enter in the next step).
3) From the results, open the post’s options and click the "Edit" link associated with the correct post.
4) In the edit form, add the exact line "Every watch makes me feel like a kid again" to the Body and save.

For now, I’ll fill the search field with the query as the first step.

The user wants me to edit their post titled "Star Trek Starfleet Academy series" and add a specific line to the body.

The search box is already filled with "Star Trek Starfleet Academy series" and is focused ([55] searchbox). The next logical step is to submit the search.

The user wants to edit their existing submission by adding a specific sentence to the Body. I am on the "Editing submission" page with the Body textbox visible (bid 125) and currently empty. To fulfill the request, I should insert the exact provided text, maintaining exact formatting and capitalization. The instruction implies quoting the sentence, so I will include the double quotes as provided. After filling the Body, I will later need to click "Edit submission" (bid 265) to save, but per constraints I can perform only one action now. The best next action is to fill the Body textbox with the exact sentence.
