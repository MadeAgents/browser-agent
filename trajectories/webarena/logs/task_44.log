The user asked to check their todos. On the current GitLab dashboard page, the top navigation bar shows a "To-Do List" link with a badge indicating 5 items. To view the todos, the logical step is to click the "To-Do List" link in the header. The accessibility tree shows this as element [171] link 'To-Do List'. Clicking it should navigate to the To-Do List page.

 <think>
The user asked to “Check out my todos.” The current page is the GitLab To‑Do List, already showing the items and counts. I should summarize the visible todos and their details rather than navigate elsewhere. The accessibility tree lists 5 items under the “To Do” tab and shows “Done 2.” Each todo displays a title, project path, type and ID (Merge Request or Issue), who assigned it, time, and a “Mark as done” action. The best next step is to provide a concise summary of these items and offer to open or mark them as done. I will use send_msg_to_user to present the information.
