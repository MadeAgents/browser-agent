The user wants me to edit their post titled "The Night Agent" and append a line to the body: "Done watching, pretty cool!". I'm on the Postmill homepage, logged in as MarvelsGrantMan136. To find the specific post quickly, it's best to use the search box rather than scrolling. The accessibility tree shows a search box labeled "Search query" with node [55]. My plan:
1) Use the search box to search for "The Night Agent".
2) Submit the search (likely by pressing Enter).
3) In the results, locate the post and click its "Edit" link.
4) On the edit form, add the specified line to the body and save.

Since only one action is allowed per step, I'll first fill the search box with "The Night Agent".

The goal is to edit my post titled "The Night Agent" and append the line "Done watching, pretty cool!" to the body. I'm on the Postmill homepage, logged in as MarvelsGrantMan136. The search box labeled "Search query" is already populated with "The Night Agent" and is focused (element [55]). To locate the specific post quickly, I should submit this search to filter the page to relevant results. Since there is no explicit search button visible, the typical way to submit is pressing Enter while the search input is focused. After the search results load, I will look for the post and click its "Edit" link to modify the body.

The user wants to edit their post to add a specific line to the body. I’m on the Search results page with the query “The Night Agent,” and I can see a result “‘The NightAgent’ Renewed for Season 2 at Netflix” that is submitted by the logged-in user “MarvelsGrantMan136.” Within that article card, there’s a visible “Edit” link alongside “116 comments” and “Delete.” According to the tips, to edit, I don’t need to open the post via its title (which might go external) or comments; the direct “Edit” link is present and is the most efficient path. Clicking “Edit” should load the edit form where I can append the line “Done watching, pretty cool!” to the body. Therefore, the best next action is to click the “Edit” link for this post.

The user wants to add a line to the body of their existing post with the exact text "Done watching, pretty cool!". I am on the edit page for the specific submission, confirmed by the heading "Editing submission ‘The Night Agent’ Renewed for Season 2 at Netflix". The form shows fields for URL, Title, and Body. The Body textarea appears empty in the accessibility tree and screenshot. To accomplish the goal, I should first enter the requested line into the Body field. After that, I will need to click "Edit submission" to save, but since only one action is allowed per step, the immediate next action is to fill the Body textbox with the provided text (without quotes). On the screenshot, the SOM id next to the Body field is 139, which aligns with the accessibility tree indicating the Body textbox. I will fill that field with "Done watching, pretty cool!".

✅ Current Progress: Reached the correct edit page for the submission “‘The Night Agent’ Renewed for Season 2 at Netflix.” No changes have been saved. The Body field still appears empty.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to the goal.
- [125] textbox “Body” (visible, currently empty).

- [115] textbox “URL” (pre-filled).
- Logged-in context: [64] “MarvelsGrantMan136” (visible).
Note: The last fill action targeted an element ID not present in the accessibility tree, and the Body field remains empty, indicating the text may not have been entered into the correct field.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Type “Done watching, pretty cool!” into textbox labeled “Body” [125].
- Click button “Edit submission” [265] to save the edit.

The user wants to append a specific line to the body of their post. I’m on the edit page for the submission, confirmed by the heading "Editing submission ‘The Night Agent’ Renewed for Season 2 at Netflix." The form shows fields for URL, Title, and Body. The Accessibility Tree indicates the Body textarea is element [125] ("textbox 'Body', describedby='submission_body_help'"). 

My previous attempt to fill the body used SOM id '139', which caused a timeout because that element isn’t visible—likely the wrong ID. The correct target appears to be [125], which matches both the accessibility tree and the SOM number overlay visible on the large Body textarea in the screenshot.

The next best step is to enter the exact line "Done watching, pretty cool!" into the Body field. After that, I will need to click "Edit submission" [265] to save the changes, but since only one action is allowed at a time, I will first fill the Body field.
