✅ Current Progress: Applied the “Filter by name” search with value “timeline,” revealing the target project in the results. No members have been added yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the GitLab Projects dashboard and is on the critical path toward adding maintainers. Relevant elements:
- searchbox labeled “Filter by name” (id: [273]), value set to “timeline,” focused.
- link “Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline” (id: [1174]), visible and clickable; this matches the extension described in the goal.
- heading for the target project (id: [1173]) associated with the link above.
- Another project link “Byte Blaze / 2019-nCov” (id: [1137]) is visible but unrelated to the goal.
The next critical step is to open the target project (link [1174]) to access its members/permissions settings.

The user wants me to add two users as Maintainer to the current GitLab project. I’m already on the Project members page with the “Invite members” modal open. The usernames field is filled with “abisubramanya27, lahwaacz.” The next step is to set the role to “Maintainer” using the role dropdown (combobox). In the accessibility tree, the combobox is [865] with listed options including “Maintainer” [869]. I will set the role to “Maintainer” first, then in the following step I can click the Invite button to complete the process.

<action>
```select_option('865', 'Maintainer')```

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the project’s Members page, opened the “Invite members” modal, entered “abisubramanya27, lahwaacz,” set role to “Maintainer,” and attempted to send the invite. The attempt failed with the error “Please add members to invite.”

🔍 Current State Analysis: The “Invite members” modal is the correct place to add maintainers and is on the critical path toward the goal.
- Textbox “Username or email address” (id 854) — visible, filled with “abisubramanya27, lahwaacz”; validation shows “No matches found,” and modal displays “Please add members to invite.”
- Role dropdown “Select a role” (id 865) — visible; current selection is “Maintainer.”
- Textbox “Access expiration date (optional)” (id 878/881) — visible, empty; not required.
- Button “Invite” (id 886) — visible, clickable.
- Button “Cancel” (id 884) — visible, clickable.
This indicates the entered identifiers are not recognized as valid invitees on this GitLab instance (likely no matching GitLab accounts), so the invite cannot proceed as-is.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Clear and retry individually: Clear the “Username or email address” field (id 854), type “abisubramanya27” alone, then click the “Invite” button (id 886). Repeat for “lahwaacz.” If a matching suggestion appears, select it before clicking “Invite.”
- If “No matches found” persists, exit the modal: Click “Cancel” (id 884), then use the global “Search GitLab” field (id 143) to check whether these users exist on this GitLab instance. Only recognized users or valid email addresses can be invited.

The user’s objective is to add two maintainers (“abisubramanya27” and “lahwaacz”) to the project. I navigated to the correct GitLab project (“remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline”), opened Project information > Members, launched the “Invite members” modal, entered both usernames, and set the role to Maintainer. 

The current modal displays an error: “Please add members to invite,” and a helper text: “Select members or type email addresses.” The “Invite” button remains disabled, which indicates the entered identifiers are not recognized as users on this GitLab instance, and the modal requires either selecting existing GitLab users (from suggestions) or entering valid email addresses. Pressing Invite doesn’t work; repeating it would be futile. Without valid GitLab accounts or email addresses for these users, I can’t proceed.

Given this, the best next step is to inform the user of the constraint and request either their email addresses or their GitLab usernames on this instance, so I can complete the invitation as Maintainer.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current modal is on the critical path to the goal.
- Alert “Please add members to invite” — visible, indicating invalid or unrecognized invitees.
- Textbox “Username or email address” (id 854) — visible, filled with “abisubramanya27, lahwaacz”, showing validation issue (“No matches found”).
- Role dropdown “Select a role” (id 865) — visible, set to “Maintainer”; enabled.
- Optional date field “Access expiration date” (id 878/881) — visible, empty; not required.
- Buttons: “Invite” (id 886) and “Cancel” (id 884) — visible; prior click did not proceed due to validation error.
This indicates the entered identifiers are not recognized as users on this GitLab instance; invitations cannot proceed until valid users are selected or email addresses are provided.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Clear and try inviting individually: Replace textbox (id 854) content with “abisubramanya27”, then click “Invite” (id 886). Repeat for “lahwaacz” individually.
- If the error persists, cancel and verify existence: Click “Cancel” (id 884), then use “Search GitLab” textbox (id 143) to search for “abisubramanya27” and “lahwaacz” to confirm they exist on this instance.
