- [434] link “Zoom In” and [436] link “Zoom Out”: visible; for adjusting zoom near the library.
- [442] link “Layers” and [445] link “Legend”: visible; legend can help identify restaurant icons on the map.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The OpenStreetMap page is relevant to the goal, but the current search failed, so the map is not centered on Hunt Library. Key elements:
- [162] textbox “Search”: currently filled with “Hunt Library, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA”, visible and editable.
- [165] button “Go”: visible and clickable (focused).

- [434] link “Zoom In” and [436] link “Zoom Out”: visible; will help refine the area once Hunt Library is located.
- [209] button “Close”: visible; closes the side panel if needed after a successful search.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Type “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” into the search field [162].
- Click the “Go” button [165] to locate the campus, after which you can zoom in and use “Query features” to find nearby restaurants.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is relevant to the goal (OpenStreetMap around CMU). However, the specific Hunt Library result did not load.

The map appears to show the CMU area, but the failed search means the library isn’t pinned/identified, which may hinder determining the closest restaurant precisely.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link [454] “Query features” to enable feature inspection on the map.
- Click link [434] “Zoom In” repeatedly to zoom into the CMU campus until the Hunt Library label or nearby POIs are visible, then use query mode to identify nearby restaurants.

✅ Current Progress: Zoomed in on the OpenStreetMap view of Carnegie Mellon University. The search for “Hunt Library, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” returned “No results found.” Hunt Library and nearby restaurants have not yet been identified.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is relevant and on the critical path toward the goal. The map shows CMU campus features (e.g., “Forbes Avenue,” “Gesling Stadium,” “The Cut,” “The Mall”), suggesting we’re in the right area to locate Hunt Library and nearby POIs.

Task: Find the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Hunt Library using OpenStreetMap. The current map is centered on Carnegie Mellon University campus (Forbes Ave, The Cut, The Mall are visible). The search panel shows “No results found” for Hunt Library, but the map is already in the right area. To precisely identify Hunt Library, I can use the “Query features” tool and click near The Mall/Frew Street area where Hunt Library should be. Once I identify the library on the map, I can look for nearby restaurant icons (fork and knife) and query them to determine which are closest. Since only one action is permitted per step, the immediate step is to activate the Query features tool so I can click on the map to identify Hunt Library and nearby POIs.

Objective: Identify the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Hunt Library using the current OpenStreetMap page. The map is already centered around Carnegie Mellon University (Forbes Avenue, The Cut, Cohon University Center are visible). The search panel shows “No results found” for the Hunt Library query, but we don’t need it since we can locate the library by map navigation and querying.

Best next step: We need to precisely locate Hunt Library on the map. At the current zoom level, detailed building labels and nearby POIs (restaurants) may not be visible. The “Query features” tool is active, but clicking without being sure of the exact building risks querying the wrong feature. To improve precision, I should zoom in further so that building labels like “Hunt Library” become visible and nearby restaurant icons (fork-knife) appear, allowing accurate queries. Therefore, the next action is to click the “Zoom In” control (bid 434).

Objective: Identify the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Hunt Library using the current OpenStreetMap page. The map is centered on Carnegie Mellon University with visible buildings (Gates and Hillman Centers, Cyert Hall, Purnell Center, The Cut). Hunt Library is not yet labeled at this zoom level. The Query features tool is active, but clicking without a clear label risks selecting the wrong feature. To accurately locate Hunt Library and nearby restaurant POIs (fork-knife icons), I should zoom in further so that building names and POI labels/icons become visible. This will allow me to precisely identify Hunt Library and then check the closest restaurant(s) around it.

Plan:
1. Zoom in to reveal Hunt Library label and nearby restaurant icons.
2. If needed, use Query features to confirm Hunt Library and restaurant names.
3. Determine which restaurant(s) are closest by visual proximity.

The user's goal is to find the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Hunt Library. I'm on the OpenStreetMap page centered around CMU with the search textbox currently containing “Hunt Library Carnegie Mellon University.” The left panel shows “No results found” from a previous query, indicating that the latest input hasn't been executed yet. Executing the search via the “Go” button should attempt to locate and center the map on Hunt Library, making it easier to identify nearby restaurant POIs (fork-and-knife icons) or use the Query features tool to confirm precise locations. Therefore, the best next step is to click the “Go” button to run the search for Hunt Library.

Goal: Identify the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Hunt Library using the current OpenStreetMap interface.

Current state:
- The map is centered on CMU area around Forbes Avenue with buildings like Tepper School of Business, Tepper Quad, Hamburg Hall, and Smith Hall visible.
- The search panel shows “No results found” for Hunt Library, but that’s okay; we can find it by zooming in to reveal building labels and POIs.
- Query features tool is available if needed to confirm building or POI names.
- To see detailed building labels and nearby restaurant icons (fork-and-knife), increasing zoom is the next logical step.

Plan:
1) Zoom in to reveal more detailed labels including Hunt Library and nearby restaurant POIs.
2) Once Hunt Library is visible, use Query features to confirm its location if needed.
3) Identify the closest restaurant(s) by visual proximity, and optionally query their names.

Single next action: Click the Zoom In control to increase detail and reveal more labels/POIs.

The user wants the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Hunt Library using the OpenStreetMap page. My previous attempts to search by name returned “No results found,” likely due to a strict viewbox or name variation. The map is already on CMU but not centered on Hunt Library, and relying solely on zoom without panning won’t guarantee we find the library. A better approach is to search by the library’s known street address, which should be well-indexed by OSM and recenter the map precisely on the library. Hunt Library’s address is 4909 Frew Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213. I will enter this into the search box (bid 162). After that, I can click Go and then identify nearby restaurants via visible POIs or Query features. Since only one action is allowed, the next best single step is to fill the search box with the address.
