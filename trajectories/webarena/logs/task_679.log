The user wants to look up completed orders. From the Magento Admin dashboard, the correct path is typically SALES > Orders, where we can apply filters to show orders with a “Complete” status. The current page is the Dashboard, and the left/top navigation shows a "SALES" link. The next step should be to click on the SALES menu to navigate to the orders area. Once there, I can filter by status to find completed orders. So the immediate best action is to click the SALES link to move towards the Orders listing page.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward the goal. In the Sales submenu (vertical menu), the following relevant element is visible and actionable:
- link “Orders” (id/index: [168]) — visible and enabled.
Other submenu links (“Invoices” [171], “Shipments” [174], etc.) are present but not required for this goal. The main content remains the Dashboard; navigating to “Orders” is needed to view and filter order statuses (e.g., “Complete”).
