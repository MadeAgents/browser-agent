The user's goal is to invite four collaborators to their "time tracking tool" project repository. I’m currently on the GitLab dashboard's Projects page with a "Filter by name" search box available, which is ideal for quickly locating a specific project without scrolling. According to the Task Tips, to add new members, I should open the project, navigate to Project information > Members tab, and click the blue "Invite members" button. 

First step is to find the project. The most efficient way is to use the "Filter by name" search box (element [273]). I should type the project name or a likely substring to narrow the list. I’ll enter "time tracking tool" directly into the "Filter by name" input to filter the projects; once the project appears, I can click into it and then proceed to the Members section in subsequent steps to invite the specified collaborators.

Therefore, the best next action is to fill the filter search box with "time tracking tool".

The user wants to invite four collaborators to the "timeit" repo. I’m on the Project members page with the "Invite members" modal open. The "Username or email address" input is focused and currently contains "Jakub K", and a suggestions dropdown is visible with three entries: "Jakub Jirutka", "Jakub Klinkovský", and "Jakub T.

To add this user to the invitation list, I should click the corresponding suggestion menu item. After that, I will proceed to add the other names in subsequent steps and then send the invite.

The user’s goal is to invite four collaborators to the timeit project. I’m on the “Invite members” modal where three users (Jakub Klinkovský, Alex Dills, Alex Hutnik) are already added as chips in the Username or email address multi-select field. I still need to add “Benoît Blanchon.” The standard workflow is to type the name into the textbox to trigger the suggestion list, then select the matching suggestion, and finally click Invite. Since only a single action is allowed per step, the next best action is to type “Benoît Blanchon” into the Username or email address textbox (bid 929) to bring up the user suggestion so I can select it in the following step.
</think>
<action>
```fill('929', 'Benoît Blanchon')```
</action>

The user wants to invite four collaborators to the "timeit" project. I’m on the Project members page with the "Invite members" modal open. The "Username or email address" multi-select already includes chips for Jakub Klinkovský, Alex Dills, and Alex Hutnik. The input field is focused with "Benoît Blanchon" typed, and the suggestion dropdown shows a selectable menu item labeled "Benoît Blanchon bblanchon" (bid 1699). To complete the list of invitees, I should select this suggestion so Benoît is added as a chip alongside the others. After that, I can click Invite in the subsequent step.

The user’s goal is to invite four collaborators—Jakub K, Alex Dills, Alex Hutnik, and Benoît Blanchon—to the “timeit” project. I’m on the Project members page with the “Invite members” modal open. In the “Username or email address” listbox, I can see chips for all four users, indicating they’ve been added to the invite list. The modal shows a role selector currently set to “Guest,” but since the user did not specify a role and the primary objective is to invite them, the most direct next step is to submit the invitations. The “Invite” button (bid 961) is visible and enabled, so clicking it should complete the invitation process and add them as members of the project.
