🔍 Current State Analysis: We are still on the Dashboard, but the CATALOG menu is expanded, which is on the critical path toward viewing products and their stock. The essential next element to reach the products grid is:
- link 'Products' (id/index 201) — visible and enabled under CATALOG.
Also present but not needed for this goal:
- link 'Categories' (id/index 204) — visible and enabled.
Once in the Products grid, we can filter for Quantity = 0 or Stock Status = Out of Stock to list product names with 0 units left.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the Catalog > Products grid in Magento Admin. No product names retrieved yet. The grid currently shows “0 records found” due to an active Quantity filter set to 10–10.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal (it lists products with columns including Quantity and Name). Relevant elements:
- Active filter pill: “Quantity: 10 - 10” (listitem [908]) with remove button (button [911], visible).
- Button “Clear all” (button [914], visible/enabled) to clear active filters.
- Button “Filters” (button [902], visible/enabled) to open the filter panel and adjust Quantity.
- Products table headers include “Name” and “Quantity,” but the table body shows “We couldn’t find any records” because of the current filter.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button “Clear all” (id/index [914]) to remove the current Quantity 10–10 filter.
- Click button “Filters” (id/index [902]) to open filters and then set Quantity min and max to 0 in the upcoming filter panel.

    - Page indicator spinbutton “of 11” [1463]: value=1.
    - Next page button [1465]: enabled.
- The grid is unfiltered for Quantity; products with 0 units are likely scattered across pages, so applying a Quantity = 0 filter is necessary to retrieve the required names efficiently.

- The page is on the critical path to the goal; it shows the filtered products list.
- Relevant elements:
  - Active filter chip “Quantity: 0 - 0” with remove button [9863]; “Clear all” button [914] is visible.
  - Results count indicates “149 records found” and pagination shows a single page (spinbutton [1463] “of 1”; nav buttons [1462], [1465] disabled).
  - Per-page control set to 200 ([1433]=200), so all results are currently visible.
  - Products table [1743] with column headers including “Name” [1765] and “Quantity” [1775]; body rows present (not expanded in the provided tree), from which product names can be read directly.
- No errors or deviations detected; the next step is to read the Name column for all listed rows (which already satisfy Quantity=0).

The user asks for the names of products that have 0 units left. I’m on Catalog > Products, and I already opened Filters and set Quantity From = 0 and To = 0, then clicked Apply Filters. The page shows “149 records found,” per-page is set to 200 and pagination indicates only 1 page, so all results are visible without scrolling. The Accessibility Tree enumerates the rows and I can read the Name column for each product; all listed rows have Quantity “0.0000.” To complete the task, I will compile the product names exactly as shown (preserving trademark symbols like ™ and ®) and send them to the user in a clear list. No further clicks are needed; the next step is to return the names via a message.
