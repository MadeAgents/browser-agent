The user’s goal is to create a private project named “web_agent_android_xl” using the Android template and then add specific members. I’m on the “Create from template” page with the Android template already selected, and the Project name and slug fields are correctly set to “web_agent_android_xl”. The Visibility Level section shows three options: Private [770], Internal [778], and Public [786], with Public currently checked. I attempted to click the Private radio [770], but it failed because the associated label [771] intercepts pointer events, preventing direct interaction with the radio input. In such cases, clicking the label itself typically toggles the radio selection. Therefore, the best next action is to click the label [771] for the Private option to set the visibility to Private. Once set, I can proceed to create the project and then add members.

  - [614] heading “web_agent_android_xl Private - Project access must be granted explicitly to each user.” — confirms Private visibility.
- Next needed step toward the goal: navigate to the area where members can be managed (typically under “Project information” > Members) to add “primer”, “convexegg”, and “abishek”.

- Observation: The “No matches found” message indicates the typed names did not resolve to valid users in the system, so invites may not succeed yet.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Clear the input and add users one at a time: type “primer” into textbox [854] and select the matching suggestion; repeat for “convexegg” and “abishek”.
- After all three users are selected, click the “Invite” button [885].

The goal is to add the users primer, convexegg, and abishek to the newly created private project. I’m currently on the Project members page with the “Invite members” modal open. The “Username or email address” field (bid 854) is filled with “primer, convexegg, abishek”, but the suggestions list indicates “No matches found,” which likely means I need to add them one at a time and select from the suggestions. To proceed, I should clear the field and type “primer” first to trigger user lookup, then select the suggestion in a subsequent step.

The user’s goal is to add primer, convexegg, and abishek as members to the newly created private project. I’m on the “Project members” page with the “Invite members” modal open. The listbox shows all three selected tokens: Primer, Convex Eggtart (convexegg), and Abishek S. The role is set to Guest by default, which the user didn’t request to change. To finalize inviting these members, I should click the “Invite” button in the modal. The accessibility tree indicates the “Invite” button has bid [886]. Clicking it will submit the invitations and complete the members addition step.
