I previously found \u201cErik Linder-Nor\u00e9n / PyTorch-GAN\u201d on the GitLab instance, which fits the GAN implementation criterion. I also opened the submission form earlier in Tab 0 (\u201cCreate submission\u201d), but the currently active tab is Tab 1 (about:blank), which doesn\u2019t help. To proceed efficiently, I should switch back to Tab 0 where the submission form is already open so I can fill in the Title, Body, and forum. I will need to include the GitLab repository URL in the Body, so after focusing Tab 0, I can either retrieve the URL (if visible or previously known) or briefly navigate to GitLab to get it. First, I will bring the submission tab to the front.\n</think>\n<action>\n```tab_focus(0)```\n</action>",
