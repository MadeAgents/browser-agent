Previously, I navigated to the project, opened the Issues list, and clicked the specific issue titled \u201c[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement.\u201d However, the current page shows a chrome error (chrome-error://chromewebdata/) with a blank screen, indicating the issue detail page failed to load. Since there\u2019s no refresh action available in the action space, the best recovery step is to navigate back to the previous page (the Issues list) and then attempt to open the issue again or directly change the assignee from the list if possible. Therefore, I will use the go_back action to return to the Issues list as the next step.\n</think>\n<action>\n```go_back()```\n</action>",
