I\u2019ve already:\n- Opened the Create submission form.\n- Selected the forum \"funny\".\n- Filled the Title with \u201ckoush/AndroidAsync\u201d.\n\nNext, I tried to open the repo to copy its exact description, but navigating to https://github.com/koush/AndroidAsync failed with a certificate error (net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID). Given the environment guidelines, I should avoid repeating the same failed external navigation. Without access to the repo page, I cannot reliably copy the exact description text. The best next step is to inform the user of the limitation and ask for the exact wording or permission to proceed with a summarized description, then continue filling the Body and submit. I\u2019ll send a message to the user explaining the issue and requesting the repo description or approval to use a concise description including the repo URL in the Body (leaving the URL field empty as per site rules).\n</think>\n<action>\n```send_msg_to_user(\"I\u2019ve set the forum to funny and the title to \u201ckoush/AndroidAsync.\u201d However, I couldn\u2019t access the GitHub page to copy the repo\u2019s exact description due to a certificate error (net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID) in this environment.
