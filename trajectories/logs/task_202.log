✅ Current Progress: Opened the Sales menu from the Magento Admin Dashboard; the Sales submenu is visible with “Orders” listed.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is the Dashboard, but the Sales submenu is expanded—this is on the critical path toward viewing orders to find the most recent canceled one. Relevant interactive elements:
- link 'Orders' [168] (visible, enabled) — needed to navigate to the orders grid.
- link 'Invoices' [171], 'Shipments' [174], etc. — present but not directly relevant to the goal.
The main content still shows dashboard widgets (e.g., “Reload Data” button) and no orders data, so the next step requires navigating to Orders to proceed toward identifying the most recent canceled order.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal (finding the most recent canceled order). However, an active filter “Status: Suspected Fraud” is applied, resulting in no records.
- button ‘Filters’ [845] — visible, enabled; needed to adjust status filter.
- listitem ‘Status: Suspected Fraud’ [851] with close button [854] — visible; indicates wrong filter for the goal.
- button ‘Clear all’ [857] — visible, enabled; will remove the current filter(s).
- columnheader ‘↑ Purchase Date’ [1390] — visible; currently sorted ascending; will be relevant after records are shown to sort by most recent.
- gridcell “We couldn’t find any records.” [1410] — confirms empty result set.
- textbox ‘Search by keyword’ [840] and button ‘Search’ [841] — present but not necessary for status-based filtering.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button ‘Clear all’ [857] to remove the “Suspected Fraud” filter.
- Click button ‘Filters’ [845] and set Status to “Canceled” to show canceled orders.

The user wants the date of the most recent canceled order. I’m already on the Orders grid (Sales > Orders). According to the tips, for recent orders queries I must sort by Purchase Date descending at least once. Best approach:
1) Open the Filters panel.
2) Set Status to “Canceled.”
3) Apply the filter.
4) Click the Purchase Date column header to ensure it’s sorted descending (most recent first).
5) Read the top row’s Purchase Date as the most recent canceled order date.

Current UI elements visible:
- Filters button [845]
- Column header ‘↑ Purchase Date’ [1390] (currently shows an up arrow, which might be ascending, but I will ensure descending after filtering)

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Sales > Orders (correct section).
- Opened the Filters panel.
- Status filter is set to “Canceled” (combobox shows value=Canceled).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The Orders grid is the correct place to find the most recent canceled order date—on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Filters toggle button [845] — visible, enabled.
  - Status combobox [972] (notice-Q9R2EUC) — expanded=True, value='Canceled', “Canceled” option [974] selected=True.
  - Purchase Date filter fields “from” [869] and “to” [876] — visible, empty (optional).
  - Keyword search textbox [840] and Search button [841] — visible, enabled (not strictly required unless used to apply filters in this UI).
- Next to progress: apply the Status=Canceled filter so the grid updates, then sort the grid by Purchase Date in descending order and read the Purchase Date from the top row as the most recent canceled order. No deviation detected.

The task is to find the date of the most recent canceled order. I’m already on the Sales > Orders grid with the Filters panel open. The Status combobox shows value “Canceled,” but the grid still displays mixed statuses, indicating the filter hasn’t been applied yet. The next required step is to click “Apply Filters” so the grid updates to only canceled orders. After that, I must ensure sorting by Purchase Date in descending order (click the Purchase Date header to toggle to descending) and then read the top row’s Purchase Date. For now, I will apply the filters.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This Orders grid (filtered to Canceled) is on the critical path to get the most recent canceled order date.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Column header “↑ Purchase Date” [1390] — visible; shows an up-arrow indicator.
  - Orders table [1368] with rows under rowgroup [1408]; first row [1751] is visible.
  - Active filters area [846] confirms “Status: Canceled”; remove filter button [9156] visible; “Clear all” [857] visible.
  - Pagination controls: “per page” textbox [1099] value=200; page indicator [1129] shows 1 of 1; next/prev buttons [1128], [1131] are disabled.
- To obtain the answer, ensure the grid is sorted by Purchase Date in descending order (toggle the Purchase Date header if needed) and read the Purchase Date from the first row.

The user wants the date of the most recent canceled order. I’m on Sales > Orders with an active filter “Status: Canceled,” and the grid shows 142 results on 1 page. The first row currently shows a date of May 23, 2023 9:20:01 PM, suggesting the grid appears to be sorted from newest to oldest (descending), even though the header indicator shows an up arrow.

The correct way to do that is to click the “Purchase Date” column header to toggle sorting. After that, I can confirm the top row’s date and report it.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is correct and on the critical path to the goal (Orders list filtered to canceled).
- Relevant interactive elements and states:
  - Active filters [846]/list [850]: “Status: Canceled” present; remove filter button [9156] and “Clear all” [857] visible/enabled.
  - Column header “Purchase Date” [1390]: currently shows “↑ Purchase Date” (ascending), clickable/visible. Ascending order places oldest orders first, so this is not yet positioned to show the most recent canceled order at the top.
  - Orders table [1368] with data rows under rowgroup [1408]; all 142 results are visible on a single page (per-page textbox [1099] value=200; pagination spinbutton [1129] shows “of 1”; prev/next buttons [1128], [1131] disabled).
- Since the header indicates ascending, the top row is not guaranteed to be the most recent; verification and descending sort are required before reading the date.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the “Purchase Date” column header [1390] to toggle sorting to descending (indicator should show “↓ Purchase Date”).
- After it’s descending, read/extract the “Purchase Date” value from the first data row in the orders table [1368] (this will be the most recent canceled order).
