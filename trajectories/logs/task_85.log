The user wants the estimated driving time from La Quinta Inn near the airport to Carnegie Mellon University. On OpenStreetMap, the best way is to use the built-in directions feature. I see the "Find directions between two points" link (with two arrows) identified as element [167] next to the search and Go buttons. According to the task tips, I should use this to open the directions panel where I can enter the start and end locations and select driving mode. The first step is to click this link to bring up the directions interface.

The user wants the estimated driving time from “La Quinta Inn near the airport” to Carnegie Mellon University. Given the task tips, if a location name is ambiguous, I should use the one in Pittsburgh, PA. The directions panel is already open, and the mode is set to Car with OSRM selected. To compute the route, I need to enter the origin and destination. The next best step is to fill the “From” textbox with the appropriate origin: “La Quinta Inn Pittsburgh Airport” (the hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport).

The user wants the estimated driving time from La Quinta Inn near the airport to Carnegie Mellon University. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with:

- Directions service set to OSRM (default, fine).

No route summary is visible yet in the accessibility tree, suggesting the route has not been computed or displayed. On OSM, routes can compute after pressing Enter in the destination field or by clicking a compute/press button. I do not see a dedicated “Press” button in the accessibility tree; thus the most reliable next step is to press Enter on the focused To field [199] to trigger the route calculation. Once the route renders, the left panel should show the estimated driving time, which I’ll read next.

Therefore, I will press Enter on the To input to compute the route.

The mode is set to Car, and the routing engine is OSRM. However, the page shows an error: "Couldn't find a route between those two places."

The user needs the estimated driving time from La Quinta Inn Pittsburgh Airport to Carnegie Mellon University. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already set up correctly:
- Mode: Car (radio is checked).
- Directions service: GraphHopper (I switched it from OSRM).
- From [194]: “La Quinta Inn Pittsburgh Airport, University Boulevard, Moon Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15108, United States”.
- To [199]: “Carnegie Mellon University, Hamerschlag Drive, Squirrel Hill North, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15213, United States”.
The live status [479] shows “Loading...”, meaning the route calculation is in progress. To ensure the route computes and displays the summary (which includes the driving time), the most effective next step is to press Enter on the destination field again to trigger or finalize the route computation under the GraphHopper engine. This is not redundant with the prior Enter presses because the engine was just changed, and pressing Enter typically forces recalculation and display of the route summary.

- Attempted to compute the route, but an error is shown.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page is on the critical path (OSM directions panel) but currently blocked by an error.
- Relevant elements:
  - Car radio [173]: checked=true; visible/enabled.

  - Error message: “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” visible under Directions [476].
- Interpretation: Inputs are correct and local, so the error likely stems from the selected routing engine or a transient backend issue.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Switch routing engine: select_option on combobox “Directions services” [182] to “Valhalla” (option [186]).
- After switching, retrigger calculation: press Enter on the To field [199] to recompute the route.

The goal is to get the estimated driving time from La Quinta Inn Pittsburgh Airport to Carnegie Mellon University using the OpenStreetMap directions panel. The current state shows:
- Mode: Car (checked)
- Directions service: GraphHopper (selected)
- From: “La Quinta Inn Pittsburgh Airport, University Boulevard, Moon Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15108, United States”
- To: “Carnegie Mellon University, Hamerschlag Drive, Squirrel Hill North, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15213, United States”
However, the panel displays “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” This usually indicates a backend issue with the selected engine rather than incorrect inputs. A practical workaround is to switch the routing engine. The combobox offers OSRM and Valhalla. We already tried OSRM earlier and then GraphHopper, and the error persists. The next logical step is to try the third available engine, Valhalla, which often succeeds when others fail. Selecting Valhalla should trigger recalculation; if not, I can press Enter on the destination in the next step. Therefore, I will switch the Directions services combobox [182] to “Valhalla”.
