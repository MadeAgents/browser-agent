The user wants the product name and discounted price (sorted low to high) from the most recent completed order. To achieve this:
1) Navigate to the Orders list: From the Magento Admin dashboard, the most direct path is via the SALES menu.
2) Once in Orders, I must sort by Purchase Date in descending order (per Task Tip 11) to ensure I identify the most recent order.
3) Filter for orders with status "Complete" (or "Completed"), then open the top-most order after sorting.
4) On the order detail page, locate the items grid, capture each product’s name and the discounted price per item (usually labeled as "Price" or "Discounted Price" where "Original Price" is also visible). If both "Original Price" and "Price" appear, "Price" typically reflects the discounted price per item.
5) Sort the extracted items by discounted price low to high and report them.

First step: click the SALES menu to get to the Orders page or its submenu.

Goal: Get the product name and discounted price (sorted low to high) of the most recent completed order.

Current page: Orders grid with Status filter = Complete. The column header shows "↓ Purchase Date", but the first few rows are from Jan 2022 increasing upward (Jan 8, Jan 9, Jan 12), which suggests the rows are sorted oldest-to-newest despite the down arrow icon. To comply with Task Tip 11, I must ensure sorting is in descending order (newest first) and do this explicitly at least once. I previously clicked the Purchase Date header once; however, the ordering still shows oldest at the top. I should click the Purchase Date header again to toggle the sort order so the most recent order appears at the top. After that, I can open the top row's "View" to access order details and extract items and discounted prices. For now, the best single action is to toggle the sort again by clicking the "Purchase Date" column header.
