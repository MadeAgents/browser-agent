The user wants the walking route (“walkway”) from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh to the closest Trader Joe’s. On OpenStreetMap, the most efficient way is to use the built-in directions panel rather than manually panning/scrolling. The UI shows a “Find directions between two points” link [167] (the two arrows button). Clicking it should open the routing panel with From/To fields and transport modes. Once open, I can enter the start as “401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh” and the destination as “Trader Joe’s” and select the walking mode. The first step is to open the directions panel by clicking [167].

The user wants the walking route (“walkway”) from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh to the closest Trader Joe’s. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open, showing transport mode radios (Car/Bicycle/Foot), a directions service selector, and two textboxes labeled “From” [194] and “To” [199]. To compute a route, I need to enter the origin and destination, select the Foot mode, and then trigger the route calculation (usually via pressing Enter or the routing button). The most logical next step is to start by filling the “From” field with the origin address “401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh, PA” so the system can geocode it. After that, I will fill the “To” field with “Trader Joe’s” and set the mode to Foot, then press Enter to calculate the route. I will proceed with entering the origin first.

Currently the transport mode is set to Car [173] (checked=true).

The task is to find the walking route (walkway) from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh to the closest Trader Joe’s using the OpenStreetMap directions panel. The panel is already open with:
- From [194]: correctly filled as “Kenmawr Apartments, 401, Shady Avenue, … Pittsburgh, PA 15206, United States”

- Transport mode currently set to Car [173] (checked=true)

I previously attempted to click the Foot radio input [179], but the click was intercepted by the Car label [174], causing a timeout. A common workaround is to click the label text associated with the desired radio instead of the small radio control. The label text element for Foot is [180] “Foot”, which should toggle the radio to the Foot mode when clicked.

Switching to Foot should trigger or at least prepare for route calculation; if it doesn’t auto-calculate, I can press Enter in the destination field afterward. But first, I need to successfully switch to Foot mode by clicking the label text “Foot” [180], since clicking the radio input itself was blocked by the overlapping Car label.

The user wants the walkway (walking route) from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh to the closest Trader Joe’s. On the current OpenStreetMap page, the routing panel is already set to Foot (walking) and shows a calculated route from “Kenmawr Apartments, 401 Shady Avenue, … Pittsburgh, PA 15206, United States” to “Trader Joe’s, 6343 Penn Avenue, East Liberty, Pittsburgh, PA 15206, United States.” The route summary shows Distance 922m and Time 0:12, with step-by-step instructions listed. Since the route is already computed and displayed, the best next step is to communicate the results to the user succinctly, including the destination’s full address (with ZIP) and the distance/time, plus the step sequence. This satisfies the task without needing further page interaction.

The user’s goal is to find the walking route (walkway) from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh to the closest Trader Joe’s. The current OpenStreetMap page already shows the Directions panel configured for Foot (walking) with:
- From: “Kenmawr Apartments, 401, Shady Avenue, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15206, United States” (this corresponds to 401 Shady Ave).
- To: “Trader Joe’s, 6343, Penn Avenue, East Liberty, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15206, United States.”
The route is computed with Distance 922m and Time 0:12, and step-by-step instructions (7 steps) are visible. Since the requested information is already present, the best next action is to send a concise summary to the user including the full destination address with ZIP code, the walking distance/time, and the step list exactly as shown, matching the required distance/time formats (e.g., 922m, 0:12). No additional page interaction is needed.

The user wants the walking route to the closest Trader Joe’s from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open and configured for Foot (walking). The “From” field shows “Kenmawr Apartments, 401, Shady Avenue, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15206, United States,” which corresponds to 401 Shady Ave. The “To” field is set to “Trader Joe’s, 6343, Penn Avenue, East Liberty, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15206, United States.” The route results are displayed with Distance 922m and Time 0:12, and the step-by-step instructions are visible: 7 steps including turning onto Penn Avenue (PA 380). Since the route is already computed and visible, the best next action is to summarize the results to the user, ensuring I include the full address (with ZIP), distance formatted without a space (922m), and the step list as shown. No more page interactions are necessary; I will use send_msg_to_user with a concise, complete answer.

The user wants the walking route to the closest Trader Joe’s from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh. The OpenStreetMap page already shows the Directions panel set to Foot with a computed route:
- From [194]: “Kenmawr Apartments, 401, Shady Avenue, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15206, United States”
- To [199]: “Trader Joe’s, 6343, Penn Avenue, East Liberty, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15206, United States”
The results show Distance 922m and Time 0:12, with a 7-step set of instructions. Since the route is already computed, the best action is to relay these details to the user, including the full destination address with ZIP and the exact steps. I will send a concise summary using send_msg_to_user. I will ensure the distance formatting is like “922m” and include the full address exactly from OSM. The previous error was “Received an empty action,” so I’ll ensure the action is properly formatted.
