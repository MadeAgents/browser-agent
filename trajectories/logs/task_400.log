The user wants to change their bio. On this Postmill interface, such actions are typically found under the user account menu. I see a user button labeled "MarvelsGrantMan136" with hasPopup='menu' and expanded=False (bid 68). The first step is to open that dropdown to access options like Profile or Settings where the bio can be edited. Therefore, I should click the user button to open the menu.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the user account menu; profile-related options are visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page shows the main feed, but the user menu is expanded, which is on the critical path to editing the bio. Relevant interactive elements in the expanded menu:
- [81] link “Profile” — visible and clickable.
- [85] link “My account” — visible and clickable.
- [89] link “User settings” — visible and clickable.
- [68] button “MarvelsGrantMan136” (hasPopup='menu', expanded=True) — controls the menu state.
These links likely lead to areas where the bio can be edited. No errors or irrelevant pages detected; navigation is on track toward the goal.
