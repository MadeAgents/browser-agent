The user asks for the count of comments with more downvotes than upvotes for the user who made the latest post on the DIY forum. To achieve this, I need to:
1) Navigate to the Forums page.
2) Find and enter the DIY forum.
3) Identify the latest post in that forum (likely by sorting by New/Latest).
4) Open the post’s author profile.
5) View their comments and count how many have more downvotes than upvotes.

Currently, I'm on the homepage with a “Forums” link visible in the top navigation (bid '42'). The first step is to click “Forums” to access the list of forums where I can locate DIY. This aligns with the provided tips that the forum can be found via the “Forum” tab. I should not scroll. I’ll click the Forums link.

Goal: Count comments with more downvotes than upvotes for the user who made the latest post on the DIY forum.

Plan:
1) Find and open the DIY forum.
2) Identify the latest post in that forum.
3) Open the author’s profile from that latest post.
4) Go to their comments and count those with downvotes > upvotes.

Current page: “List of forums” with options: Forums, Tags, Alphabetical, a search box, and a paginated list of forums. The DIY forum isn’t visible without scrolling. Based on the task tips, clicking “Alphabetical” under the Forum tab helps locate a forum name efficiently. This should present a better way to navigate alphabetically (likely with letter anchors), which lets me jump to D to find DIY quickly without scrolling.

Next action: Click the “Alphabetical” link (bid 117) to access an alphabetical index of forums, making it easier to locate “DIY”.
