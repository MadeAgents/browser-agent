The user wants the status of their latest order and its expected arrival. Since they are logged in (I see "Welcome, Emma Lopez!"), the correct path is to navigate to the account area and then to order history. The top banner includes a "My Account" link (bid 227). Clicking "My Account" should take me to the account dashboard where I can access "My Orders" to find the most recent order details, including status and delivery estimate. I will start by clicking "My Account".

✅ Current Progress: 
- Arrived on the “My Account” dashboard.
- Located the “Recent Orders” section/table showing the latest orders with a Status column and per-row action links.
- No specific order details page opened yet; delivery estimate not retrieved.

🔍 Current State Analysis: 
- This page is on the critical path to the goal (checking latest order status and ETA).
- Relevant elements:
  - Table “Recent Orders” (id: [1534]) — visible.
  - Link “View All” (id: [1530]) — visible and enabled; opens full order history.
  - Per-row action links “View Order” (e.g., first-row link id: [1555]) — visible and enabled; needed to see shipment/ETA.
- The first row appears to be the most recent order; its Status cell shows “Canceled” in the screenshot. To confirm and to find an ETA (if any), an order details page must be opened via the corresponding “View Order” link.

The user wants the status of their latest order and its arrival date. I’m on the “My Account” page, which shows a “Recent Orders” table with several entries. The first row appears to be the most recent by date (Order #000000170 on 5/17/23) and shows Status “Canceled.” To provide a definitive answer and check if there is any delivery information (which likely won’t exist for a canceled order), I should open the order details page by clicking the “View Order” link for that most recent order. The “View Order” link in the first row is bid 1553. Opening it will confirm the status and any shipping/ETA info. This is better than relying solely on the table, as details pages sometimes include estimated delivery dates or shipping progress; if canceled, I can definitively state it won't arrive.
