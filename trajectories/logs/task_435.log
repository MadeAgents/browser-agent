The user wants me to add the product with the lowest per unit price from the open tabs to the cart. I need to compare the unit prices of the two tabs. The current active tab (Tab 1) shows a 2-pack priced at $15.99, which implies a per-unit (per cable) price of $7.995. To decide if this is the lowest, I must check Tab 0’s price and whether it’s a single unit or a pack. The most efficient next step is to switch to Tab 0 to view its price and product details. After that, I can compute and choose the lowest per unit product and then add it to the cart on the appropriate tab. So my next action is to focus Tab 0.

✅ Current Progress: Focused on Tab 0 and opened the product detail page. Identified the listed price as $25.04 and located the quantity selector and “Add to Cart” button.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is a product detail page and is on the critical path toward the goal (adding a product to the cart). Relevant interactive elements:
- Price: StaticText “$25.04” (visible).
- Quantity selector: spinbutton labeled “Qty” [1675], value=1 (visible, editable).
- Add to Cart: button labeled “Add to Cart” [1677] (visible; no disabled state indicated).
- Cart status: link “My Cart 7 items” [278] (visible).
Pack size or unit-per-pack information is not indicated here, so the per-unit price cannot be conclusively compared against other open tabs from this page alone. Further inspection of other tabs is needed to determine the lowest per-unit price before adding to cart.

The goal is to add the product with the lowest per unit price from the open tabs to the cart. On the current active tab (Tab 0), the product is a single 35 ft HDMI cable priced at $25.04, which implies a per-unit price of $25.04. To determine if there is a lower per-unit price among the open tabs, I need to check Tab 1, which is a “2 Pack” DP to HDMI Cable 6FT. The per-unit price depends on the total price divided by 2. I should switch to Tab 1 to verify its price and pack size details so I can compare and then add the lowest per-unit product to the cart. Since I can only perform one action at a time and I need the price info from Tab 1, the best next step is to focus Tab 1.

The task is to add the product with the lowest per unit price from the open tabs to the cart. I compared the two tabs: Tab 0 is a single 35 ft HDMI cable priced at $25.04 (per unit $25.04), while Tab 1 is a 2-pack DP to HDMI 6FT cable priced at $15.99 (per unit $7.995). Therefore, Tab 1 has the lower per unit price. The current active page is Tab 1, and the “Add to Cart” button is visible with the quantity set to 1. The next step is to click the “Add to Cart” button to add this item to the cart.
