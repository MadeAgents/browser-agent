The user asks for the nearest tea cafe to the University of Pittsburgh and the walking distance. On OpenStreetMap, I should first locate "University of Pittsburgh" using the search box, then search for nearby tea cafes or identify one on the map and use the directions feature to compute walking distance.

The current page shows the OpenStreetMap homepage with the search textbox focused (bid 162) and a Go button (bid 165). The map is currently centered over Singapore, so I must first search for "University of Pittsburgh" to move the map to Pittsburgh, PA. After that, I can search for tea cafes near the location, but the first step is to find and select the university itself. Thus, I will enter "University of Pittsburgh" into the search field.

The user asks for the nearest tea cafe to the University of Pittsburgh and the walking distance. On the current OpenStreetMap page, a search has been performed and the left panel shows a Nominatim result list with a specific result link [481] for “University of Pittsburgh, 4200, Fifth Avenue, ... Pittsburgh, PA 15260, United States.” 

To find the nearest tea cafe and compute walking distance, the most logical next step is:
1) Center the map on the University of Pittsburgh by clicking the result link [481]. This will position the map at the university location, which is necessary before searching for nearby POIs (tea cafes) or using the directions tool.
2) After centering, I can then either search for tea cafes in the area or use the query/directions tools to calculate walking distance.

So the next single action is to click the University result link [481] to center the map on the university.

Objective: Find the nearest tea cafe to the University of Pittsburgh and provide the walking distance. We're on OpenStreetMap with the Directions panel open: "To" is prefilled with the University of Pittsburgh full address. For walking distance, we must switch the routing mode from Car to Foot. Then, we will search for nearby tea cafes (e.g., Fuku Tea, Kung Fu Tea, etc.) by entering them into the "From" field and compare distances if needed. The immediate necessary step is to change the mode to Foot so that any subsequent route calculated gives walking distance.

UI Analysis:
- Directions panel shows radios for Car [173 checked], Bicycle [176], Foot [179].
- "From" field [194] is empty; "To" [199] is set to University of Pittsburgh.
- We cannot scroll; the best sequence is to set Foot first, then proceed to fill "From" with candidate tea cafes.

Plan for next steps:
1) Click Foot radio [179] to set walking mode.
2) Then try searching for the nearest tea cafe by entering a likely nearby cafe (e.g., "Fuku Tea") into the "From" field and calculate the route; if results are inconclusive or there are multiple, we can test another nearby cafe.

Given only one action per step, the next best action is to select Foot.

The OpenStreetMap directions panel is open with “To” already set to the University of Pittsburgh and “Foot” (walking) mode selected. To identify nearby tea cafes, the best next step is to use OpenStreetMap’s “Query features” tool, which lets me click on the map near the university and see a list of nearby POIs (including cafes). From there, I can identify tea cafes and then set one as the other endpoint to compute walking distance. So I will enable the Query features tool first.

Goal: Find the nearest tea cafe to the University of Pittsburgh and provide the walking distance. The Directions panel is open with “To” already set to the University of Pittsburgh and the routing mode set to Foot (walking). To identify the nearest tea cafe, I planned to use the “Query features” tool, which reveals nearby POIs (like cafes) when clicking on the map. However, the “Query features” tool currently shows a tooltip “Zoom in to query features,” meaning we must increase the zoom level before we can query specific POIs. The “Zoom In” control is available on the right toolbar (bid 434). Dismissing the welcome overlay is optional, as it doesn't block zooming.

Next step: Click “Zoom In” to increase the map zoom so that “Query features” becomes usable. After zooming in sufficiently, I can use the Query tool to click near the University of Pittsburgh marker and discover nearby tea cafes, then compute walking distance via the Directions panel.

The task is to find the nearest tea cafe to the University of Pittsburgh and provide the walking distance. We are on OpenStreetMap with the Directions panel open, walking mode selected, and the "To" field set to the university address. To identify the nearest tea cafe accurately, using the "Query features" tool near the university will list nearby POIs including cafes and tea shops. However, the tool previously indicated we need to zoom in further to query features.

Task: Find the nearest tea cafe to the University of Pittsburgh and provide the walking distance. Current OSM page shows the directions panel with "To" set to the University of Pittsburgh and walking mode selected. However, the map appears centered around the North Side (coordinates ~40.45359, -80.00416), not around the university in Oakland, and the "Welcome to OpenStreetMap!" overlay is visible and could be obstructing controls like the main search bar.

Plan:
1) Dismiss the "Welcome to OpenStreetMap!" overlay to clear the UI and access the main search or better interact with the map/directions.
2) Then either:
   - Use the search to center the map at the University of Pittsburgh to query nearby features (POIs) with the "Query features" tool, or
   - Use the directions panel to reverse directions so the University is the origin and then test nearby tea cafes.

First, I will close the overlay using button [217] labeled "Close" associated with the welcome message. This is a safe, deterministic step that improves the workspace before proceeding to locate nearby tea cafes accurately.

Objective: Identify the nearest tea cafe to the University of Pittsburgh and provide the walking distance. The OpenStreetMap Directions panel is already open with walking mode selected, and the “From” field is set to “University of Pittsburgh.” The “To” field is empty. 

We need to determine which nearby tea cafe is closest. A practical way is to input known nearby tea cafe candidates into the “To” field and compute walking routes, comparing distances. Likely nearby options include Kung Fu Tea, Fuku Tea, and Tsaocaa in Oakland. Start with one candidate by entering it into the “To” field; after computing one route, we can try another and compare distances.

Immediate next step: Fill the "To" field with a candidate tea cafe name, such as "Kung Fu Tea Pittsburgh," to get a walking route. After that, we can compute the route (press Enter or similar) and read the distance, then test other candidates if needed. Since only a single action is allowed now, I will fill the "To" field.

The goal is to find the nearest tea cafe to the University of Pittsburgh and provide the walking distance. I’m on OpenStreetMap’s Directions panel with walking mode selected (Foot radio is checked). The “From” field is set to the University of Pittsburgh’s full address, and the “To” field is filled with “Kung Fu Tea Pittsburgh,” currently focused. To compute the route and get the walking distance, I should trigger the route calculation. On this interface, pressing Enter in the “To” field typically initiates the routing. Therefore, the next best single action is to press Enter while the “To” textbox [199] is focused to compute the walking route and retrieve the distance. After this, I can assess the distance and, if needed, compare with other nearby tea cafes to determine the nearest.

- Gap: We have a walking route to one tea cafe but have not verified which tea cafe is nearest.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Replace the destination with a closer candidate near campus: Type “Fuku Tea, Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh” into the To field [199] and press Enter to compute the walking distance.
- If needed to compare, overwrite the To field [199] with “Tsaocaa Pittsburgh (Oakland)” and press Enter, then choose the shortest distance.

The OpenStreetMap Directions panel is already open in Foot mode, with “From” set to “University of Pittsburgh … 15260” and “To” set to “Kung Fu Tea, 2101–2109 Murray Avenue … 15217,” yielding a walking distance of 4.3km. However, this is unlikely the nearest tea cafe; there are tea cafes much closer to campus in Oakland, such as Fuku Tea on Forbes Avenue. 

To determine the nearest, I should test likely nearby tea cafes by entering them as the destination and computing the walking distance. The “To” field [199] is focused. The best next action is to replace the current destination with “Fuku Tea, Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh,” which is known to be near the university, and then (in the following step) press Enter to compute the walking route. This approach will help identify a shorter walking distance and move toward establishing the nearest tea cafe.

The user asks for the nearest tea cafe to the University of Pittsburgh and the walking distance. We're on OpenStreetMap with the Directions panel open, routing mode set to Foot. The "From" field [194] is "University of Pittsburgh, 4200, Fifth Avenue, ... 15260, United States." The "To" field [199] is filled with "Fuku Tea, Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh" and is currently focused, but the distance shown (4.3km, 0:57) corresponds to the previous destination (Kung Fu Tea on Murray Ave), since we haven't recalculated after changing the "To" field.

To progress, we need to compute the new walking route to the currently entered destination ("Fuku Tea, Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh"). On this UI, pressing Enter while the "To" textbox is focused triggers route calculation. After this, I can read the updated distance; if it still seems too far (indicating the Squirrel Hill Fuku Tea), I can refine to "Fuku Tea Oakland" or try other nearby tea cafes and compare distances. But the immediate necessary step is to press Enter to compute the route for the updated "To" field.
