The user wants the total duration for a two-leg trip: first walking from Carnegie Mellon University to Starbucks on Craig Street, then driving to Pittsburgh International Airport. On the OpenStreetMap page, the search box is present, and there is a directions link identified as "Find directions between two points" (bid 167) located near the Go button. To get durations, I should use the directions tool rather than just searching, because it provides routing with mode options (walking, driving) and shows time estimates.

The first step is to open the directions interface. From there, I can enter the start and end points for the first leg, select walking, capture the time, then switch to the second leg with driving mode. I will begin by clicking the "Find directions between two points" link to open the routing panel.

The user asks for the total duration of a two-leg trip: first walking from Carnegie Mellon University to the Starbucks on Craig Street, then driving to Pittsburgh International Airport. On the OpenStreetMap directions UI, I need to:
1) Set mode to walking for the first leg (Foot radio button).
2) Enter From = Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, PA) and To = Starbucks on Craig Street (Pittsburgh, PA), run the route, and read the walking duration.
3) Switch mode to Car and set From = Starbucks on Craig Street (Pittsburgh, PA) and To = Pittsburgh International Airport, run the route, and read the driving duration.
The directions panel is open, with Car selected by default. The “Foot” radio [179] is unchecked. The next optimal step is to select the Foot radio to prepare for the walking leg before entering locations. This ensures OSRM computes a walking route for the first leg.

The task requires obtaining durations for a two-leg route using OpenStreetMap’s directions panel: first walking from Carnegie Mellon University to Starbucks on Craig Street, then driving to Pittsburgh International Airport. The directions UI is open, and the mode is currently set to Car, with the Foot radio [179] visible but my last attempt to click it failed because the Car label [174] intercepted the pointer events. A common workaround is to click the label associated with the desired radio button instead of the radio itself.

The user needs total duration for a two-leg trip: walking from Carnegie Mellon University to the Starbucks on Craig Street, then driving to Pittsburgh International Airport. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open and set to Foot mode (radio [179] is checked, confirmed earlier). To compute the first leg duration, I should enter the start and end points in the From [194] and To [199] fields. The standard OSM directions UI typically computes after pressing Enter in one of the fields; if not, I can press Enter explicitly using the press action. Following the general tip, using the search fields is more efficient than trying to pan/scroll. 

The next optimal step is to fill the From field with “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” to ensure we're selecting the Pittsburgh instance, not another CMU elsewhere. After that, I will fill the To field with “Starbucks on Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA” and press Enter to generate the walking route.

Thus, the immediate next action is to fill the From textbox [194].

✅ Current Progress: Directions panel is open and configured for leg 1 (walking). “From” is set to Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, PA) and “To” is set to “Starbucks on Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA.” Attempt to run the route resulted in a “Search failed” error. Leg 2 (drive to Pittsburgh International Airport) not started.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is relevant (OpenStreetMap directions UI), but progress is blocked by a modal error dialog.
- Modal dialog [147] “Search failed” (modal=True, focused) with message “Couldn’t locate ‘Starbucks on Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA’.” Close buttons [152] and [155], visible/enabled.
- Mode group [172]:
  - Foot radio [179]: checked=true (correct for first leg).
  - Car radio [173]: checked=false (needed later for second leg).
- Directions service combobox [182] value='OSRM', visible/enabled.
- From textbox [194]: filled with Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, PA), visible/enabled.
- To textbox [199]: filled with “Starbucks on Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA,” visible/enabled but not recognized by the router.
- Reverse Directions button [200]: visible/enabled.
The error indicates the destination string wasn’t matched; the blocking modal must be dismissed before retrying with a more specific/parsable destination.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button 'Close' [155] on the “Search failed” dialog to dismiss the modal.
- In textbox 'To' [199], replace with “Starbucks, S Craig St, Pittsburgh, PA” and press Enter to compute the walking route.

The task is to determine the total duration for a two-leg trip: first walking from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to Starbucks on South Craig Street, then driving from that Starbucks to Pittsburgh International Airport. 

Current page status:
- We are on OpenStreetMap’s directions panel.
- Mode is currently set to Car.
- From field [194] = Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, PA).
- To field [199] = Starbucks, 428 South Craig Street (Pittsburgh, PA).
- The displayed result now shows a car route between CMU and Starbucks (Distance 532m, Time 0:01), which matches the current car mode.

Next objective:
- Compute the second leg (driving) from Starbucks to Pittsburgh International Airport. Since the current origin is CMU and destination is Starbucks, the quickest way to set the correct origin (Starbucks) is to click “Reverse Directions” so that From becomes Starbucks. After reversing, I will change the To field to “Pittsburgh International Airport” and compute the route to get the driving duration.

Rationale for this step:
- Clicking “Reverse Directions” [200] is the most efficient single action to set the origin to Starbucks, which is required for the second leg. Then I can input the airport and compute the route in subsequent steps.

The user’s goal is to find the duration for two legs: (1) walk from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to the Starbucks on Craig Street, and (2) drive from that Starbucks to Pittsburgh International Airport. We are using OpenStreetMap’s directions panel, which is appropriate per the task tips. The current page shows the directions UI with Car mode selected. The “From” field is set to "Starbucks, 428, South Craig Street, ... Pittsburgh, ... 15213, United States" because I previously clicked “Reverse Directions,” making Starbucks the origin—this is correct for the driving leg. The “To” field currently contains "Walking to the Sky, Forbes Avenue, ... Pittsburgh, ..." which is not our desired destination. We need to replace the “To” field with “Pittsburgh International Airport” (ideally specifying Pittsburgh to ensure the correct one). After updating the destination, we will need to press Enter to compute the route. Since only one action is allowed per step, the optimal next action is to fill the To field with “Pittsburgh International Airport” to set up the car route. In the next step, I will press Enter to compute and then read the driving duration. The walking leg’s duration (previously computed) was 0:07 (7 minutes), but for now we need to compute leg 2.

The user’s goal is to find the duration for two legs: (1) walk from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to the Starbucks on Craig Street, and (2) drive from that Starbucks to Pittsburgh International Airport. We are using OpenStreetMap’s directions panel, which is appropriate per the task tips. The current page shows the directions UI with Car mode selected. The “From” field is set to "Starbucks, 428, South Craig Street, ... Pittsburgh, ... 15213, United States" because I previously clicked “Reverse Directions,” making Starbucks the origin—this is correct for the driving leg. The “To” field currently contains "Walking to the Sky, Forbes Avenue, ... Pittsburgh, ..." which is not our desired destination. We need to replace the “To” field with “Pittsburgh International Airport” (ideally specifying Pittsburgh to ensure the correct one). After updating the destination, we will need to press Enter to compute the route. Since only one action is allowed per step, the optimal next action is to fill the To field with “Pittsburgh International Airport” to set up the car route. In the next step, I will press Enter to compute and then read the driving duration. The walking leg’s duration (previously computed) was 0:07 (7 minutes), but for now we need to compute leg 2.

The user wants the total duration for a two-leg trip: first walking from Carnegie Mellon University to Starbucks on Craig Street, then driving from Starbucks to Pittsburgh International Airport. We are already on OpenStreetMap’s directions panel with Car mode selected. The From textbox shows Starbucks (which is correct as the origin for the driving leg after reversing earlier), and the To textbox is set to “Pittsburgh International Airport, Pittsburgh, PA”. The results section currently shows a short car route time (0:01) that clearly corresponds to an earlier, local route and not the airport trip, so the new destination hasn’t been executed yet. To compute the driving leg, I should trigger the routing by pressing Enter on the To field [199], which is currently focused. After getting the car duration, I’ll be able to sum it with the previously observed walking leg duration (0:07). The immediate optimal next action is to press Enter on the To field to compute the updated route.

The user's question asks for the duration required to first walk from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to Starbucks on Craig Street, then drive to Pittsburgh International Airport. I used the OpenStreetMap directions panel to compute both legs:
- First leg (Foot mode): From = Carnegie Mellon University, To = Starbucks, South Craig Street. The results displayed Distance 538m and Time 0:07 (7 minutes).
- Second leg (Car mode): I reversed the direction to set From = Starbucks, then set To = Pittsburgh International Airport (the UI resolved to Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport at the airport). The results displayed Distance 34km and Time 0:30 (30 minutes).

The combined duration is 0:07 + 0:30 = 0:37 (37 minutes). The instructions emphasize concise answers and including sufficient context; I will provide the breakdown and the total duration clearly. Now I will send the final answer to the user with both legs’ durations and the total.
