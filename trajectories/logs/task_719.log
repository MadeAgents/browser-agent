The user wants me to like all submissions made by a specific user (ThetaGang_wsb) in the forum called wallstreetbets. On this Postmill homepage, I see navigation links including "Forums". According to the task tips, when finding a relevant subreddit/forum, I should go to the "Forum" tab and possibly use an alphabetical view to locate it. So the next logical step is to click the "Forums" link to get to the forums listing page, where I can then search or navigate to "wallstreetbets". From there, I can filter or browse posts and then like all submissions by the specified user. I will click the "Forums" link now.

Goal: Like (upvote) all submissions by the user “ThetaGang_wsb” in the wallstreetbets forum.

Current page: /f/wallstreetbets submissions list. I can see at least two posts authored by “ThetaGang_wsb”:
- “How much will the Federal Reserve raise interest rates in November FOMC meeting?” with an Upvote button [168]
- “How will AIRBNB close following their Earnings Report on November 1?” with an Upvote button [243]

Since the objective is to like all submissions by this user in this forum, I should start by upvoting the visible ones directly from the list, then later navigate to the user profile to verify if there are additional wallstreetbets submissions to upvote. The environment only allows one action per step, so I’ll first upvote the top visible “ThetaGang_wsb” submission using the Upvote button [168]. This is a safe, productive first step toward the goal.

The goal is to like (upvote) all submissions by the user “ThetaGang_wsb” in the wallstreetbets forum. I’m currently on the /f/wallstreetbets submissions list where I can see two posts by that user. Previously, I accidentally clicked “Retract upvote” on one of their posts, which likely removed an upvote. I should proceed to upvote the other visible “ThetaGang_wsb” post to make progress. The second post “How will AIRBNB close following their Earnings Report on November 1?” shows an active “Upvote” button (bid 243). Clicking it will like that submission. After this, I can go to the user profile via the author link to ensure all their submissions (especially within wallstreetbets) are liked, and also re-like the first post if needed. For now, I will upvote the second post.
