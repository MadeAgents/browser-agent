The user needs the driving time from Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh) to the nearest Cold Stone Creamery. On OpenStreetMap, the best workflow is to use the directions feature (two arrows icon/link) which allows entering a start and end location and will typically choose the closest matching destination if multiple exist. The search bar is focused, but using the “Find directions between two points” link is more direct for an A-to-B route. Once the directions panel opens, I’ll fill the “From” with “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” and the “To” with “Cold Stone Creamery”, then compute driving directions. For now, I will click the directions link to open the panel. I must perform only one action per step, so I’ll start by clicking the “Find directions between two points” control (bid 167).

The user wants the driving time from CMU (Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh) to the nearest Cold Stone Creamery. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open, with the "Car" mode selected, and there are two textboxes: "From" [194] and "To" [199]. To compute the route, I should first fill the "From" field with "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" to set the origin correctly (important because the current map viewport is in Singapore, so I must constrain the search to Pittsburgh). After that, I’ll fill the "To" field with an appropriate query like "Cold Stone Creamery, Pittsburgh, PA" and then press Enter to trigger routing. Since only one action is allowed per step, the immediate next action is to fill the "From" textbox with the CMU address string.
