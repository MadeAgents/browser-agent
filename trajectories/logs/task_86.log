The user wants the estimated driving time from La Quinta Inn near the airport to Upitt (University of Pittsburgh). On OpenStreetMap, the best way is to open the directions interface, which allows entering a start and end location and then shows route details including time. I see a link labeled "Find directions between two points" (element [167]) next to the search area. Clicking this should open the directions panel where I can input "La Quinta Inn" near the airport and "University of Pittsburgh" in Pittsburgh, PA. I will start by opening the directions UI.

The user wants the estimated driving time from La Quinta Inn near the airport to "Upitt" (University of Pittsburgh). On the OpenStreetMap directions panel, the “Car” mode is already selected, which is appropriate for driving time. I need to enter the origin and destination in the From and To textboxes and then trigger the route calculation.

Given the task tips for this environment: entering the locations and then initiating route calculation (commonly by pressing Enter in OSM) is the way to get the time. The map is currently centered on Singapore, but OSM’s search will still find Pittsburgh addresses.

For the origin, “La Quinta Inn near the airport” likely refers to “La Quinta Inn by Wyndham Pittsburgh Airport” (Moon Township, near PIT). To maximize the chance OSM selects the correct one, I’ll input a specific, unambiguous query: “La Quinta Inn Pittsburgh Airport”. For the destination, I’ll use “University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA” to be explicit.

I will first fill the “From” field (bid 194) with “La Quinta Inn Pittsburgh Airport”. After that, I will fill the “To” field and then press Enter on it to compute the route. The current step is to populate the From field.

The user's goal is to get the estimated driving time from La Quinta Inn near the airport to the University of Pittsburgh (Upitt). On the current OpenStreetMap directions panel, Car mode is selected (good), the directions service is OSRM, and the fields are already filled:
- From: “La Quinta Inn Pittsburgh Airport, University Boulevard, Moon Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15108, United States”

On OSM, route calculation is typically triggered by pressing Enter in the To field. There is no explicit “Go” button shown in the accessibility tree, and the standard way is to submit the destination. Therefore, the next best action is to simulate pressing Enter on the To textbox to calculate the route and display the estimated driving time. I will use the press action on element [199] with Enter.
