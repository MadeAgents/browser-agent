✅ Current Progress: Entered the /f/explainlikeimfive forum page where submissions are listed. No upvote has been performed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward the goal. To upvote the newest post, the feed should be sorted by “New” rather than the current “Hot”.
- Sorting control: button labeled “Sort by: Hot” (hasPopup=menu, expanded=False, visible). This is the control to change sorting to “New”.
- Content tab links: “Submissions” and “Comments” links are present; “Submissions” is the relevant view for posts.
- Post actions: Each article listing contains a Section with:
  - button “Upvote” (e.g., within the first article’s Section [168], and similarly [205], [242], etc.). These are visible role=button elements; no disabled state indicated.
  - button “Downvote” (not needed for the goal).
- Current listings show older posts (timestamps like “3 years ago”), reinforcing that sorting to “New” is needed to locate the newest post.
