 <think>
The user wants to create a new private project named AGISite using the JEKYLL template and then add Rohan and Vinta as members. I'm currently on the GitLab Projects dashboard, which shows a "New project" link (element [252]) near the top. The first step to accomplish the goal is to initiate the project creation flow by clicking "New project." Once in the creation flow, I can select the JEKYLL template, set the project name to AGISite, set visibility to Private, create the project, and then navigate to the Members tab to invite Rohan and Vinta. Therefore, the best next action is to click the "New project" link.
