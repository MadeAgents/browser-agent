The user wants me to invite Abishek to the "dotfiles" repository as a guest. From the tips, the best workflow is: open the dotfiles repository, go to Project information > Members, click the blue "Invite members" button, and invite with the Guest role. I'm currently on the Projects dashboard with a "Filter by name" searchbox visible (bid 273). To find the dotfiles repo quickly, I should use this search box rather than scrolling. My next step is to fill the filter with "dotfiles" to narrow the visible projects to the target repo. Once filtered, I can click the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project in a subsequent step.

The user wants Abishek invited to the dotfiles repository as a Guest. I’m already on the Project members page with the “Invite members” modal open. The “Username or email address” field is filled with “Abishek”, and a suggestion list shows “Abishek S abisubramanya27”. The role combobox is already set to Guest, which satisfies the requirement. The next step is to select the correct user from the suggestions to populate the invitee field, after which I can click the “Invite” button. Therefore, I should click the suggestion “Abishek S abisubramanya27” now.
