The user wants me to post a request for advice about a break-up remedy in the appropriate forum (subreddit) for relations. On this Postmill site, “subreddit” maps to “forum.” The best approach is:
1) Go to the Forums page to find the forum named “relations.” The Task Tips say I can find a relevant forum by clicking “alphabetical” in the Forum tab if needed.
2) Open the “relations” forum so that posting there will be straightforward (often the forum will be preselected if I submit from within it).
3) Click Submit to create a new post.
4) When creating the post, per instructions, leave the URL field empty and put all content in the Body field, using the exact text formatting from the task. The request text is “Ask for advice about break-up remedy,” so I will use that as the title and also include it in the Body to satisfy the “put all content in the Body” requirement.

First, I need to navigate to the Forums listing. I see a “Forums” link in the top navigation (bid 43). I will click that to find the list and then look for a way to locate “relations.”

We are on the "Create submission" page for the forum "relationship_advice", which matches the user's request for a relations subreddit. The form shows:
- URL/Image radio (URL selected), with a URL textbox (we will leave it empty per instructions).
- Title field (required).
- Body field.
- Forum is already set to "relationship_advice".
- Create submission button.

The task requires using the exact text from the request and placing all content in the Body, leaving the URL empty. However, the Title is required, so we should also put the exact requested text into the Title to ensure submission succeeds while maintaining exact formatting. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next optimal action is to fill the Title field with the exact phrase: "Ask for advice about break-up remedy in a subreddit for relations". After that, I will fill the Body with the same exact text, then submit.
