The user wants the walking time between "Univ of Pittsburgh" and "starbucks on Craig Street" using the OpenStreetMap interface. According to the task tips, I should use the two-arrow button (directions) next to the Go button to open the directions panel, then enter the start and end points and ensure the mode is set to walking. The current page shows a link labeled "Find directions between two points" (likely the two-arrow button) with bid 167. The first step is to click this link to open the directions input fields. I will then proceed in subsequent steps to fill the "From" and "To" fields, set walking mode, and compute the route to get the walking time.

The user asks for walking time between "Univ of Pittsburgh" and "starbucks on Craig Street." I'm on OpenStreetMap with the directions panel open. The mode is currently set to Car; I will later switch to Foot (walking). To proceed efficiently, I should first populate the "From" field with a clear, disambiguated location in Pittsburgh, PA, since the current map is centered around Hong Kong and search may otherwise suggest irrelevant results. After that, I’ll fill the "To" field with “Starbucks, Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA,” change the mode to Foot, and trigger routing (often pressing Enter in each field is sufficient). 

Next best action: fill the "From" textbox with "University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA" to anchor the origin correctly.
