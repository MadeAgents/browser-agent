  - “Brain cancer vaccine succeeds at prolonging survival in Phase 3 trial”: “Downvote” [259].
  - Additional articles below also show “Downvote” buttons in their respective Sections.
- No errors or login barriers detected. The next key step is to change sorting to view the “Top” posts (all-time) so you can downvote the top five.

- Relevant controls:
  - Button “Sort by: Top” [128] — visible, enabled, selected.
  - Button “From: All time” [147] — visible, enabled, selected.
- Post actions (top of list):
  - Article 1: “Brain cancer vaccine succeeds at prolonging survival in Phase 3 trial”
    - Buttons: Upvote [186]; Retract downvote [196] — visible/enabled (indicates already downvoted).
  - Article 2: “India cuts internet for 27 million people amid search for fugitive”
    - Button: Downvote [234] — visible/enabled.
  - Article 3: “US judge orders Amazon to ‘cease and desist’ anti-union retaliation”
    - Button: Downvote [272] — visible/enabled.
- Note: The last action clicked “Retract downvote” [196], which would remove an existing downvote and is counter to the goal.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button id=234 (“Downvote”) on the second post.
- Click button id=272 (“Downvote”) on the third post.

The task is to thumbs down the top 5 posts ever in the technology forum. We are on /f/technology with sorting set to Top and time range set to All time, which is correct. 

From the accessibility tree:
- The first post shows a “Retract downvote” button and a score of −1, indicating it’s already downvoted. So post #1 is satisfied.
- The second post (“India cuts internet for 27 million people amid search for fugitive”) shows a “Downvote” button [234], meaning it’s not yet downvoted.
- Posts #3, #4, and #5 also have “Downvote” buttons [272], [310], and [348], respectively.

I should proceed to downvote the second post first. Only one action is allowed per step, so I will click the “Downvote” button for the second post (bid 234) now.

Objective: Downvote (thumbs down) the top 5 posts ever in the technology forum. The page is already filtered to “Top” and “All time” (URL shows /f/technology/top?t=all). 

State review:
- Based on the earlier tree, the first two posts initially showed “Retract downvote,” meaning they were already downvoted, but I clicked [196] and [234], which likely retracted those downvotes. I’ll need to re-apply downvotes to those, but to keep steady progress and avoid uncertainty about changed element IDs for the first two, I will downvote posts that clearly show “Downvote.”
- The third post (“US judge orders Amazon to ‘cease and desist’ anti-union retaliation”) shows a “Downvote” button with id [272]. This is a clear, reliable target that contributes directly toward the goal.

Plan:
1) Click the “Downvote” on the 3rd post now (id [272]).
2) Then proceed to click “Downvote” on the 4th ([310]) and 5th ([348]).
3) Finally revisit the first two posts to ensure they are downvoted (if their buttons changed to “Downvote” after my earlier retraction, click them again).

Next best single action: Click the “Downvote” button for the third post (id [272]).
