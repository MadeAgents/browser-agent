The user wants to disable the product "Ryker Tee Crew Neck" so it no longer appears on the site. In Magento, this is done by navigating to the product in Catalog > Products, editing it, and setting the product status to Disabled, then saving. I'm currently on the Dashboard. The next step is to go to the Catalog section to access Products. The left navigation shows a "CATALOG" link (bid 189).
