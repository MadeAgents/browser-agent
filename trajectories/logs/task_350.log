The user wants to know who else has access to their repo "prism-theme." On the Projects dashboard, I see a repository named "Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme," which likely corresponds to the requested repo (often users shorten names). To find members with access, the GitLab workflow is to open the project and then navigate to Project information > Members. From there, I can read the list of users and their usernames. The immediate next step is to click into the "solarized-prism-theme" project. I will click the "Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme" link (bid 1011) to open the project page, after which I can proceed to the Members section.

✅ Current Progress
- Opened the GitLab project page for “solarized-prism-theme” (private repo). This is the correct starting point to view who has access.

🔍 Current State Analysis
- The page is on the critical path toward the goal. To see users with access, you typically need the Members page under Project information.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link “Project information” (node [278]) in the left sidebar — visible, enabled. This should expose the “Members” option.
  - Link “Settings” (node [511]) in the left sidebar — visible, enabled (access-related settings but not the member list).
- No errors or off-track indicators detected. The next actionable element to reach member usernames is “Project information” → “Members”.

The user asks: “Who else have access to my repo prism-theme, show me their usernames.” We’re on the GitLab project page “Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme,” which appears to be the intended repo. To find who has access, I should navigate to the Members list. According to the UI tips, this is under Project information > Members. On the current page, the left sidebar shows a “Project information” link (bid 278). Clicking it should either navigate to the project overview where a Members tab is available or expand a submenu that includes “Members.” The next best step is to click “Project information” to reach the section where I can access the Members list and extract usernames.

The user wants to know who else has access to their repo and to see their usernames.
