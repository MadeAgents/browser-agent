The user wants the OpenStreetMap page of the undergraduate college of the person who developed the Nash equilibrium. That person is John Nash, whose undergraduate institution was Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon University, located in Pittsburgh, PA. On the current OpenStreetMap page, there is a Search textbox (bid 162) already focused. The best next step is to enter "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" into the search box to find the location’s page. After filling, I will click Go, but since only one action is allowed per step, I will start by filling the search field.

✅ Current Progress: Entered “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” into the Search field on OpenStreetMap.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap’s main interface, which is appropriate for locating a university’s map page. Relevant interactive elements:
- Textbox labeled “Search” (node [162]): filled with “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA”, focused, visible.
- Button “Go” (node [165]): visible and enabled next to the search box.
- Button “Close” (node [217]): visible; closes the “Welcome to OpenStreetMap!” overlay, which may help clear the view.
- Map controls like “Zoom In” (node [434]) and “Zoom Out” (node [436]): visible and enabled, but secondary to initiating the search.

No deviation detected; the agent is on the critical path toward the goal.

The task is to find the OpenStreetMap page of the undergraduate college of the person who developed the Nash equilibrium. That person is John Nash, and his undergraduate institution was Carnegie Institute of Technology, which is now Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. In the previous step, I already filled the search box with “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA”. The next logical step is to initiate the search by clicking the “Go” button next to the search field. This should display search results in the left panel and allow me to select the correct university page. I will click the “Go” button (bid 165) to proceed.
