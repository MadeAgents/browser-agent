The user wants to find hotels around CMU main campus. On OpenStreetMap, the most efficient way is to use the Search textbox and then navigate to the CMU main campus area. The search field [162] is present and currently focused, with a "Go" button [165] next to it. Per the task tips, if a location name may be ambiguous, specify Pittsburgh, PA. So the next best step is to enter "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" into the search box to center the map and bring up results near CMU. After this, I can click Go to execute the search in the following step.

✅ Current Progress: Entered “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” into the Search box on OpenStreetMap.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is relevant and on the critical path to the goal. Key elements:
- Textbox labeled “Search” (node [162]): focused and filled with “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA”.
- Button “Go” (node [165]): visible next to the search box; used to execute the search.
- Link “Find directions between two points” (node [167]): visible but not required yet.
- Map controls: “Zoom In” (node [434]) and “Zoom Out” (node [436]) are visible for refining the view after locating CMU.
- Optional overlay controls: “Close” (node [217]) for the welcome panel if it obscures the map after navigating.

Once the search is executed (via the Go button), the map should center on CMU; from there, searching for “hotel” or using map features can identify hotels around the campus.

Goal: Find hotels around CMU main campus on OpenStreetMap.

Current page: We are already on OpenStreetMap with the map centered on Carnegie Mellon University area, showing the Search Results panel for CMU. To find nearby hotels efficiently, it's best to use the search bar rather than manually scanning the map (per tips: use search/filters). The search textbox [162] is visible and currently contains "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA". The next step is to query for hotels near CMU by entering a targeted search such as "hotel near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA". After that, I will click the Go button to see the results list, and then identify and open one or more hotel entries to extract full addresses.

Given only one action per step, I will first fill the search box with the new query string.

✅ Current Progress

- Multiple searches were attempted (“hotel near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” and “Wyndham Pittsburgh University Center, Pittsburgh, PA”) but returned “No results found.”
- The “Query features” tool was clicked; it is now focused with its tooltip visible, indicating readiness to inspect POIs on the map.

🔍 Current State Analysis
- The page is relevant and on the critical path to the goal (map shows the CMU area).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Textbox “Search” (id [162]): value = “Wyndham Pittsburgh University Center, Pittsburgh, PA”; visible, editable.
  - Button “Go” (id [165]): visible and enabled.
  - Search Results panel (heading [511], list [515]/[516]): shows “No results found.”
  - Link “Query features” (id [454]): focused; tooltip [517] visible; used to click the map to retrieve feature details.
  - Map canvas tiles (images [488]–[502]): visible; interactive area where POIs can be queried with the active tool.
  - Button “Close” (id [209]): visible; can hide the results panel to maximize map space.
  - Zoom controls “Zoom In” (id [434]) and “Zoom Out” (id [436]): visible and enabled.

The user’s goal is to find a hotel around CMU’s main campus using OpenStreetMap. Previous generic searches returned “No results found,” and the “Query features” tool is active but requires clicking specific map points, which is less precise without coordinate targeting. A better approach is to search for a specific, well-known nearby hotel to get a concrete result. “The Oaklander Hotel, Pittsburgh, PA” is a recognized hotel near the university area (Oakland/Shadyside). The search box [162] is visible and currently contains another query. The next best action is to replace it with “The Oaklander Hotel, Pittsburgh, PA” to attempt to retrieve its entry via Nominatim, after which I can click Go on the following step.

Objective: Find a hotel around Carnegie Mellon University’s main campus using the current OpenStreetMap page.

Current state:
- The map is centered around CMU (Cohon University Center and Gesling Stadium visible).
- The Search textbox [162] currently contains “The Oaklander Hotel, Pittsburgh, PA”.
- The Search Results panel shows “No results found” from a prior query, indicating the new query hasn't been executed yet.
- The “Go” button [165] is available and should trigger a search via Nominatim.

Plan:
- Execute the current search for “The Oaklander Hotel, Pittsburgh, PA” by clicking the “Go” button. This should return a hotel result near CMU. Once results load, I can select the listing to retrieve its details (e.g., name, address). If this still yields no results, I may pivot to using the Query Features tool or try another nearby hotel query.

Rationale:
- Using the search function aligns with the tips to avoid scanning and to leverage search for finding places quickly. The best immediate step is to trigger the search by clicking “Go”.

The user’s goal is to find a hotel around CMU main campus using the current OpenStreetMap page. The page is already showing a search result for “The Oaklander Hotel, Pittsburgh, PA” in the Search Results panel with a full address: “The Oaklander Hotel, 5130, Bigelow Boulevard, North Oakland, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15260, United States.” This satisfies the requirement to get the address from OpenStreetMap and includes a ZIP code. Since the user did not specify “closest” or “multiple” hotels, providing this identified hotel with its complete address is sufficient. No further navigation is necessary. I should now send the result back to the user, formatted as requested (landmark, street, district, city, state, ZIP, country).
