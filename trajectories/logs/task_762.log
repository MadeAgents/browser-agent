The user wants driving directions from Carnegie Music Hall in NYC to Carnegie Mellon University. On the OpenStreetMap page, the search box is present along with a link labeled "Find directions between two points" (the two-arrow button mentioned in the task tips). To input start and end locations, I should first open the directions pane by clicking this link. This will reveal the "From" and "To" fields and mode options (including driving). After that, I can enter the specified locations and select the driving option. Therefore, the next step is to click the "Find directions between two points" link.

The user wants driving directions from “Carnegie Music Hall in NYC” to “Carnegie Mellon University.” The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with the Car (driving) mode selected, which matches the requirement. The next step is to populate the “From” and “To” fields. Although the user phrased it as “Carnegie Music Hall in NYC,” the well-known NYC venue is “Carnegie Hall,” and searching for “Carnegie Music Hall, NYC” should typically resolve to “Carnegie Hall, New York.” To minimize ambiguity and improve geocoding success, I will enter “Carnegie Hall, New York, NY” into the From field. After that, I will fill the To field with “Carnegie Mellon University” and then trigger the route calculation (likely by pressing Enter or selecting a suggestion). For now, the best single next action is to fill the From textbox [194] with the origin.

The user asked for driving directions from Carnegie Music Hall in NYC to Carnegie Mellon University. On the current OpenStreetMap directions page, the driving mode (Car) is already selected, and the route has been computed. The “From” field shows “Carnegie Hall … New York, 10019, United States,” which corresponds to the NYC venue the user likely intended. The “To” field is “Carnegie Mellon University, … Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States.” The summary displays Distance: 598km and Time: 7:23, with a full turn-by-turn list visible. Since the route is already generated and matches the driving option, the appropriate next step is to inform the user with a concise summary containing origin, destination, mode, distance, and time, and highlight the main segments. No further interactions with the page are needed.

The user wants driving directions from “Carnegie Music Hall in NYC” to “Carnegie Mellon University.” On the current OpenStreetMap directions page, the directions panel is already open, the “Car” (driving) mode is selected, and the route has been computed. The From field shows “Carnegie Hall, … New York, 10019, United States,” which aligns with the NYC venue the user likely intended, and the To field is “Carnegie Mellon University, … Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, United States.” The summary shows Distance: 598km and Time: 7:23, with turn-by-turn steps listed. Since the task is effectively complete, the appropriate next step is to provide a concise, standalone summary including origin, destination, mode, distance, and time, and optionally route highlights. I will use send_msg_to_user to deliver this information, formatted per instructions (distance as “598km” and including the full addresses with ZIP codes from OSM).
