The user asks for walking time from “the starbuck near CMU” to “Chatham university.” We should use OpenStreetMap’s built-in directions tool to get a walking route. The current page shows the OSM main map with the search bar and a link labeled “Find directions between two points” (bid 167). According to the task tips, we should use the two arrows/directions feature for routes and then input start and end points. The first step is to open the directions panel. I will click the “Find directions between two points” link to bring up From/To fields and transport mode options (where I will later select walking and enter the locations, likely specifying Pittsburgh, PA if needed).

The user's goal is to find the walking time from the Starbucks near CMU to Chatham University. We are on the OpenStreetMap directions interface with the transport mode set to "Foot," which is correct for walking. The From and To fields are empty. According to the tips, we should specify Pittsburgh, PA for ambiguous locations. The next step is to input the starting point (Starbucks near CMU) into the "From" textbox. I will enter a clear query that should be recognized by OSM, specifying Pittsburgh, PA to avoid ambiguity. After that, I will fill the destination and then trigger the route calculation.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened OpenStreetMap’s Directions panel.
- Travel mode set to Foot.
- Attempted to set origin and destination.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is relevant (OSM directions), but progress is blocked by a modal error and incorrect inputs.
- A modal dialog “Search failed” [147] is open and focused; it states OSM couldn’t locate “Starbucks near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA”. It has Close buttons [152] and [155] (visible/enabled).

  - Mode radio “Foot” [179]: checked=true, visible/enabled.
  - Directions service combobox [182]: value=OSRM, visible/enabled.
  - “From” textbox [194]: value='Starbucks near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA' (visible/enabled) — this query failed to geocode.
  - “To” textbox [199]: value='Chatham U, Century Village - West Palm Beach, ... Florida, United States' (visible/enabled) — incorrect destination; needs “Chatham University, Pittsburgh, PA”.
  - “Reverse Directions” button [200]: visible/enabled.
- The modal must be dismissed, and both endpoints need precise Pittsburgh-based entries to proceed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
1) Click the “Close” button on the error dialog [155] to dismiss the blocking modal.
2) In the “From” textbox [194], replace the text with a more precise query such as “Starbucks, Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA” to ensure geocoding succeeds.

The user wants the walking time from Starbucks near CMU to Chatham University. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with transport mode set to Foot (correct). The From field contains “Starbucks near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” and the To field contains “Chatham University, Pittsburgh, PA” and is currently focused. Typically, in OSM’s directions UI, after filling both fields, pressing Enter in one of the textboxes triggers the route calculation. There’s no separate “Go/Press” button visible in this layout; the “Reverse Directions” button isn’t for starting a search. To proceed, I should trigger the route calculation by pressing Enter in the To field (id 199). If the geocoder fails to find the Starbucks, I will then refine the origin to a specific Starbucks near CMU, but first I should try the standard Enter to calculate the route.

The user wants the walking time from Starbucks near CMU to Chatham University. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with transport mode set to Foot (correct). The From field contains “Starbucks near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” and the To field contains “Chatham University, Pittsburgh, PA” and is currently focused. Typically, in OSM’s directions UI, after filling both fields, pressing Enter in one of the textboxes triggers the route calculation. There’s no separate “Go/Press” button visible in this layout; the “Reverse Directions” button isn’t for starting a search. To proceed, I should trigger the route calculation by pressing Enter in the To field (id 199). If the geocoder fails to find the Starbucks, I will then refine the origin to a specific Starbucks near CMU, but first I should try the standard Enter to calculate the route.

The user needs the walking time from a Starbucks near Carnegie Mellon University to Chatham University. On the OpenStreetMap Directions panel, the mode is already set to Foot, and the To field is correctly resolved to “Chatham University… Pittsburgh, PA 15217, United States.” However, earlier there was a “Search failed” for the From field when using “Starbucks near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA,” which suggests the origin wasn’t geocoded to a specific POI. The map hasn’t centered on Pittsburgh or displayed a route yet, indicating the route likely hasn’t been computed because the From location is too ambiguous.

To proceed, I should refine the From field to a more specific Starbucks that’s indeed near CMU. The well-known Starbucks by CMU is on Craig Street. Using “Starbucks, Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA” should help the geocoder find the exact POI. After correcting this, I can then trigger the route calculation (e.g., by pressing Enter), but since only one action is allowed per step, I will first update the From field to a specific value that’s likely to resolve successfully.

The user needs the walking time from the Starbucks near CMU to Chatham University. We are on OpenStreetMap’s directions panel with the transport mode set to Foot, which is correct. The “From” field [194] now contains “Starbucks, Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA,” a specific Starbucks near CMU that should geocode successfully. The “To” field [199] is already set to Chatham University’s detailed Pittsburgh address. Typically, after both fields are filled, pressing Enter in one of the textboxes triggers the route calculation.
