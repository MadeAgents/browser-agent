The user asks for the price range for products from "ugreen." I’m on the One Stop Market homepage, which has a prominent search bar (combobox with bid 386) and an Advanced Search link. The most efficient way to locate Ugreen products is to use the search bar rather than browsing categories. The Search button (bid 391) is currently disabled, which likely becomes enabled after entering a query. 

Plan:
1) Enter "ugreen" into the search field (bid 386).
2) Once populated, submit the search (either the button will enable or I can press Enter in a subsequent step).
3) On the search results page, identify all listed Ugreen products and their prices across any pages, then determine the minimum and maximum prices to report the range.

First step now: fill the search box with "ugreen".

The user asks: “What is the price range for products from ugreen?” I’m on the One Stop Market homepage with the search box already filled with “ugreen” (combobox id 386 shows value 'ugreen' and is focused). To find the price range, I need to view the search results for Ugreen products, collect the prices across all listed items (including multiple pages if present), then determine the minimum and maximum. The next logical step is to submit the search. There’s a visible “Search” button (bid 391). Clicking it should navigate to the results page where I can analyze prices. I should avoid redundant actions; since the query is already entered and suggestions are open, I won’t re-fill or pick from the suggestion list; I’ll trigger the search directly via the Search button.
