The user needs to collect review titles for a specific product on OneStopShop (this site appears to be "One Stop Market") and then later post them on the games forum. The first step is to locate the product page for "Racing Wheel Overdrive for Xbox X" on the current shopping site. The homepage shows a search bar with a combobox element labeled "Search" (bid 372), and the search button (bid 377) is currently disabled, likely enabling once a query is entered.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is directly relevant to the goal; it shows customer reviews for “Racing Wheel Overdrive Designed for Xbox Series X|S By HORI.” Key elements:
- Reviews entry: link “12 Reviews” (visible/clickable) opens the reviews list; the reviews tab is currently open.
- Review cards: each displays a title and a “Rating” indicator (e.g., “Rating 20%” corresponds to 1 star); these titles are visible and readable.
- Pagination controls: links “Page 1”, “Page 2”, and “Next” are visible and enabled, allowing access to all review pages.
- Non-essential elements: “Add Your Review” link and review form fields are present but not needed for data collection.

No deviation detected; continue scanning all review pages and record titles where the rating shows 1 star (typically “Rating 20%”).

The task is to gather the titles of 1-star reviews for the Racing Wheel Overdrive product on OneStopShop and then post them to the games subreddit. I’m currently on the product page with the Reviews tab open. The accessibility tree shows the pagination area with “Page 1” and indicates I am currently reading page 2. On page 2, I can see one 1-star review ("Only works with certain games." rated 20%). To ensure I collect all 1-star titles, I need to navigate to page 1 and inspect the reviews there for any entries with "Rating 20%" which corresponds to 1 star. The "Page 1" link is available with bid 2679. Clicking it will switch to page 1 where I can identify additional 1-star review titles.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the correct OneStopShop product page and opened the Customer Reviews section.
- Collected these 1-star (Rating 20%) review titles so far:
  - Unable to set neutral steering
  - Doesn’t work with PC.
  - Crazy problems in automatic mode; then pedals stopped working
  - Only works with certain games.
- Posting on the games subreddit has not started.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current product reviews page is directly on the critical path for gathering the required 1-star review titles (not yet on the critical path for the Reddit posting step).
- Relevant interactive elements for progressing:
  - link “12 Reviews” ([1524]) — visible and clickable; the reviews list is open.
  - Reviews pagination — “Page 1” and “Page 2” links are visible and enabled; use them to ensure all 1-star titles are captured across both pages.
  - link “Add Your Review” ([1527]) and the review form fields (“Nickname”, “Summary”, “Review”) — visible, empty, enabled; not needed for this task.
- Visible reviews include multiple titles; at least one 1-star title is present on Page 2 (“Only works with certain games.”) and additional 1-star titles are present on the other page. Ensure both pages are checked so no 1-star titles are missed.

The task involves two steps: 1) gather all titles of 1-star reviews (Rating 20%) for the Racing Wheel Overdrive product from OneStopShop, and 2) post those titles in the games subreddit. I’m currently on the product page with the Reviews tab open, and the pagination shows "You're currently reading page 1" with a "Page 2" link available (bid 4016). On page 1, I can already identify four 1-star reviews: "Unable to set neutral steering," "Doesn’t work with PC.," "Crazy problems in automatic mode; then pedals stopped working," and "Only works with certain games." To ensure completeness, I should click "Page 2" to check if there are any additional 1-star review titles there before proceeding to make the forum post. Using the pagination link is the most efficient next step.

The task has two parts: 1) gather titles of 1-star reviews from the product page, and 2) post them to the games forum. I’ve already identified the 1-star (Rating 20%) review titles visible across the product’s reviews pages: "Unable to set neutral steering," "Doesn’t work with PC.", "Crazy problems in automatic mode; then pedals stopped working," and "Only works with certain games." The next step is to navigate to the community forum site to create the post in the games subreddit (forum) using the given title "real user feedback on Racing Wheel Overdrive for Xbox X". To begin that, I should go to the forum URL provided in the task tips: http://10.177.37.113:9999/forums/all. Once there, I can find the "games" forum and create the submission.

The task requires posting in the gaming forum with the title already set to "real user feedback on Racing Wheel Overdrive for Xbox X" and including the collected 1-star review titles in the Body. I’m on the Create submission page with the Title field [138] already filled. The Body field [143] is empty and ready for input. The forum is correctly set to "gaming" via the combobox [384]/[385]. According to the Reddit task tips, all content should be placed in the Body and the URL field left empty, which aligns with the current form state (URL radio is checked but URL textbox [128] is empty). The next best single action is to fill the Body textbox with the list of 1-star review titles gathered: “Unable to set neutral steering”, “Doesn’t work with PC.”, “Crazy problems in automatic mode; then pedals stopped working”, and “Only works with certain games.” I will enter each title on a new line to keep them clear and separated.
