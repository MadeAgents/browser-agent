The user asks for the number of reviews received in May 2023. The most efficient way is to use the Reports section, which typically includes review reports with date filters. The dashboard page shows the main navigation menu with a REPORTS link (element 339). Clicking REPORTS should navigate to the reports area where I can look for review-related reports and set the date range to May 1–31, 2023 to get the count. So the next step is to click the REPORTS menu.

The user asks for the number of reviews received in May 2023. From the current Dashboard page, the Reports overlay is open and shows the Reviews section with two links: "By Customers" (bid 370) and "By Products" (bid 373). To get counts, the Reviews reports typically allow setting a date range and display counts either per customer or per product. Choosing "By Products" should show review counts aggregated by product for a specified date range, which we can sum to get the total number of reviews. The next step is to click "By Products" to open that report page where I can set the date range to May 1, 2023 through May 31, 2023 and then calculate the total count.

  - [761] textbox “To” with calendar button [762]
  - [696] button “Search” to apply filters
  - [699] button “Reset Filter”

  - “Last Review” column has the date range filter described above.
- Utilities:
  - [688] combobox “Export to:” (value='CSV') and [691] button “Export”
  - Pagination: [708] combobox “per page” (value='20'), [718] page index (value='1'), nav buttons [716]/[722]
- Note: The available date filter targets “Last Review”. After setting From=May 1, 2023 and To=May 31, 2023 and clicking “Search”, the filtered rows’ “Reviews” counts can be summed to get the total for that period (may require adjusting “per page” or exporting).

The user asks for the total number of reviews received in May 2023. The current page is “Product Reviews Report” (By Products), which aggregates reviews per product and includes a “Last Review” date filter. Summing the “Reviews” column after filtering by “Last Review” date could be misleading because it may reflect total reviews per product whose last review falls in May, not necessarily all reviews created in May.

A more reliable method is to use MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews, where each review is an individual record. Filtering that page by Created Date from May 1 to May 31, 2023 will show a “records found” count that directly equals the number of reviews in May 2023. Therefore, I should navigate to MARKETING to access “All Reviews” and apply the date filter.
