The user wants the driving distance from Carnegie Mellon University to the top computer science school in Massachusetts. The commonly recognized top CS school in Massachusetts is MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). On the OpenStreetMap page, the most efficient way to get driving distance is to use the directions feature. The accessibility tree shows a link labeled "Find directions between two points" [167] near the search and go buttons. Following the map task tips, I should use the two-arrow directions button rather than just searching. My next step is to click that link to open the route planner where I can input the start (Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA) and destination (MIT, Cambridge, MA) and then calculate the distance.

The directions panel is already open with "Car" mode selected, and there are two textboxes labeled "From" [194] and "To" [199]. To compute the driving distance, I need to input the origin and destination. The origin should be "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" and the destination should be "Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA" (MIT). I'll start by filling the "From" field with the CMU address. After this, I will fill the "To" field and then trigger routing (usually pressing Enter or clicking a suggested match). One action is allowed at a time, so I'll first fill the "From" textbox.

The user wants the driving distance from Carnegie Mellon University to the top computer science school in Massachusetts, which is MIT. On the OpenStreetMap directions page, the "Car" mode is already selected, and both the "From" field and "To" field are filled: the origin is the full CMU address and the destination is "Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA". The "To" textbox is currently focused. Typically, OpenStreetMap computes the route when you confirm the destination (e.g., press Enter) or select a suggestion. Since suggestions are not visible, the next logical step is to press Enter on the "To" field to trigger routing by OSRM, which should display the route summary including the driving distance. I will perform a key press (Enter) on the "To" textbox to initiate the route calculation.
