The user wants the description page of Carnegie Mellon University on OpenStreetMap. The current page is the OpenStreetMap main page with a visible and focused Search textbox (bid 162) and a Go button (bid 165). The standard workflow is to type the place name into the search field and then click Go to get search results, then select the correct result to open the description page. Following the instruction to use the search bar rather than scrolling, my next best step is to fill the search box with "Carnegie Mellon University". After that, I will click Go in a subsequent step to view results and then choose the appropriate result that includes the Pittsburgh, PA location.

✅ Current Progress: Entered the search query “Carnegie Mellon University” into the OpenStreetMap search box.

- [162] textbox labeled “Search”: visible, focused, value set to “Carnegie Mellon University”.
- [165] button labeled “Go”: visible and enabled; not yet clicked, so no search results are displayed.
- [217] button labeled “Close” for the welcome panel: visible; may be used to dismiss the overlay if it obstructs interactions.

The user wants the description page of Carnegie Mellon University on OpenStreetMap. The search textbox is already filled with "Carnegie Mellon University" and focused. The next logical step is to initiate the search by clicking the "Go" button located next to the search bar. This should bring up search results where I can select the correct Carnegie Mellon University entry (in Pittsburgh, PA) to open its description page. The welcome overlay is present but does not obstruct the "Go" button, so clicking "Go" is appropriate now.
