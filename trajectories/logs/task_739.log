The user wants directions from Carnegie Mellon University to the New York Yankees' home stadium in the 1980s, which is the original Yankee Stadium.

The user's request is to "Show me the way from Carnegie Mellon University to the home stadium of Yankees in the 80th#." This refers to Yankee Stadium in the Bronx (the Yankees’ home in the 1980s). The OpenStreetMap directions page already shows a computed car route from Carnegie Mellon University to Yankee Stadium, including full addresses and ZIP codes, distance (610km), estimated time (7:31), and detailed turn-by-turn steps. According to the Map Task Tips, I should provide the full addresses exactly as displayed, include the distance in “610km” format, and present a concise set of steps using wording from the route. No further page interactions are needed; the best next step is to send a summary to the user via send_msg_to_user. I will keep the message concise while including essential details and exact wording for key steps.

The user wants directions from Carnegie Mellon University to the Yankees’ home stadium in the “80th#,” which I interpret as the 1980s. The Yankees’ home in that era is Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. The OpenStreetMap directions page is already showing a computed car route with:
- From: Carnegie Mellon University, Zebina Way, North Oakland, Bellefield, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15213, United States
- To: Yankee Stadium, 1, East 161st Street, The Bronx, Bronx County, City of New York, New York, 10451, United States
- Distance: 610km
- Time: 7:31
Additionally, the turn-by-turn steps are visible. Per the map task tips, I should provide the full addresses (including ZIP codes), distance/time in the indicated formats, and an overview of the key route steps using exact wording where possible. No further page interactions are needed; the route is already computed. The best next action is to send a concise directions summary to the user via send_msg_to_user.

The user asked to “Show me the way from Carnegie Mellon University to the home stadium of Yankees in the 80th#.” The “80th#” is interpreted as the 1980s, when the Yankees played at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. The current OpenStreetMap directions page already has a computed car route using OSRM, with both “From” and “To” fields filled and the turn‑by‑turn directions visible. The summary shows Distance: 610km and Time: 7:31, and both addresses include ZIP codes, satisfying the map task requirements. The best next step is to provide a concise summary to the user that includes the full addresses exactly as shown on the page, along with the distance/time formats and a brief route overview, using exact wording where helpful. No further page interactions are needed; I will send the directions via send_msg_to_user.

The user asked for directions from Carnegie Mellon University to the Yankees’ home stadium in the “80th#,” which I interpret as the 1980s. The Yankees’ home then was Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. The current OpenStreetMap page already shows a computed car route using OSRM, with both the “From” and “To” fields filled with full addresses including ZIP codes, and the turn-by-turn directions are visible. The summary displays Distance: 610km and Time: 7:31. To “show the way,” I should provide a concise summary with the full addresses (exactly as shown), distance/time in the required formats, and a brief route overview. No further page interaction is needed; sending the directions to the user will fulfill the request.

The user requested directions from Carnegie Mellon University to the Yankees’ home stadium in the “80th#,” which I interpret as the 1980s. The Yankees’ home in that period was Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. The current OpenStreetMap page already shows a computed car route using OSRM with the “From” and “To” fields filled:
- From: “Carnegie Mellon University, Zebina Way, North Oakland, Bellefield, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15213, United States”
- To: “Yankee Stadium, 1, East 161st Street, The Bronx, Bronx County, City of New York, New York, 10451, United States”
The route summary displays Distance: 610km and Time: 7:31, and the turn-by-turn steps are listed. Per the map task tips, I should provide the full addresses including ZIP codes, use exact formatting for distance/time, and present a concise overview of the route steps using the wording on the page. No further interaction is needed; I will send a clear summary via send_msg_to_user.
