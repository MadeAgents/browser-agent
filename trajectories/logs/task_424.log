The user wants the page of the place where Mr. Rogers was filmed. Mister Rogers' Neighborhood was filmed at WQED Studios in Pittsburgh, PA. On OpenStreetMap, the most efficient way to find a location is to use the search bar rather than trying to navigate the map manually. The search textbox [162] is already focused, and the next step is to enter a precise query such as "WQED Pittsburgh, PA" to locate the WQED studios. After filling, I will click "Go" in a subsequent step to perform the search.

✅ Current Progress: Entered the search query “WQED Pittsburgh, PA” into the Search textbox; the field is focused.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap and is on the critical path to finding the location page for where Mr. Rogers was filmed. Relevant interactive elements:
- [162] textbox labeled “Search” — filled with “WQED Pittsburgh, PA”, focused, visible.
- [165] button “Go” — visible and appears enabled; this will trigger the search.
- [217] button “Close” — visible; closes the “Welcome to OpenStreetMap!” overlay, which may otherwise cover part of the left panel where results appear.
- [167] link “Find directions between two points” — present but not needed for locating the place.

The user’s goal is to find the page of the place where Mr. Rogers was filmed. Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood was filmed at WQED in Pittsburgh, PA. I have already entered “WQED Pittsburgh, PA” into the OpenStreetMap search textbox [162], which is focused. The next logical step is to execute the search by clicking the “Go” button [165]. This should display search results or navigate to the WQED location page in OpenStreetMap. If a welcome overlay obstructs results, I can close it afterward, but first I should initiate the search.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap and is directly relevant to the goal. The search appears to be processing.
- [162] textbox “Search” — value set to “WQED Pittsburgh, PA”, focused, visible.
- [165] button “Go” — visible and enabled; previously clicked (currently focused).
- [213] status “Loading...” — live region indicates search results are being fetched.
- [209] button “Close” — visible; can dismiss an overlay if it obstructs the results panel.
- Map controls ([434] “Zoom In”, [436] “Zoom Out”, [454] “Query features”, etc.) are present but not needed until the location/result appears.

The user wants the OpenStreetMap page for the place where Mr. Rogers was filmed, which is WQED in Pittsburgh, PA. I already filled the search box with “WQED Pittsburgh, PA” and clicked “Go.” The accessibility tree shows a live region with “Loading...,” indicating the search is in progress, and a large spinner is visible in the left sidebar. To ensure the search executes if it’s stalled or to re-trigger it cleanly without closing the results pane, the safest next step is to press Enter while the search textbox remains focused. This avoids hiding the sidebar with the “Close” button and is more appropriate than clicking “Go” again, which could be redundant. Once results appear, I’ll select the WQED entry in the following step.
