The user’s goal is to update the address for order #299 to “456 Oak Avenue, Apartment 5B, New York, NY, 10001.” I’m on the Order Address Information edit form, where Street lines 1 and 2, City, and State are already correctly set: “456 Oak Avenue,” “Apartment 5B,” City “New York,” and State “New York.” The Zip/Postal Code field is still set to “94602,” which needs to be changed to “10001.” Before saving, the next necessary step is to update the ZIP code. I will fill the Zip/Postal Code textbox (bid 1095) with “10001,” and after this, I will proceed to click “Save Order Address.”

<action>
```fill('1095', '10001')```
