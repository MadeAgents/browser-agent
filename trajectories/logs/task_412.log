I can see the specific project "Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns" with a link element [579]. The first step is to navigate into this repository. Once inside, I will look for an existing LICENSE file. If present, I will edit it to Apache License; if not, I will add a new file named LICENSE with the Apache License 2.0 text and commit to the default branch (per tips, main is often master, but we will see which default branch is present).

The goal is to set the repository’s LICENSE to the Apache License. I’m on the “Edit file” page for LICENSE in the main branch of byteblaze/accessible-html-content-patterns. I already applied the “Apache License 2.0” template; the editor shows the correct text beginning with “Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004.” The commit message field is prefilled with “Update LICENSE,” and the Target Branch is set to “main,” which aligns with the instructions to commit changes to the main branch unless specified otherwise. To finalize the change, I need to commit the edit. The “Commit changes” button (bid 1016) is visible and should save the new LICENSE content to the repository.
