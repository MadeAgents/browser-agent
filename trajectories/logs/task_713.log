The user wants a Best Sellers report for a specific date range (05/01/2022 to 05/31/2023). The Dashboard page shows some widgets including a "Bestsellers" tab, but to create a proper report with date filters, I should navigate to the REPORTS section, which typically contains a dedicated "Bestsellers" report under Products. From there, I can set the date range and generate the report. The next logical step is to click the REPORTS menu item to access the reports area. I see the REPORTS link in the top navigation with element id [339]. I will click it to proceed.
