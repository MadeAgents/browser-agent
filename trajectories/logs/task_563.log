The user wants me to create a new GitLab repository named "fun_thing_to_do" and include a README with links to the most active 5 DIY ideas on the DIY subreddit. I’m currently on the GitLab dashboard where I can start by creating the repository. The page shows a clearly labeled "New project" button (element [252]) in the Projects section. The first step should be to click that button to start the project creation flow. Once the repository is created, I will need to gather the top 5 active DIY ideas from the forum site and then populate the README with those links.

The task is to create a GitLab repository named "fun_thing_to_do" with a README. I’m on the "Create blank project" form, but when I attempted to create the project, the page displayed validation errors: “Project namespace name has already been taken”, “Name has already been taken”, and “Path has already been taken”. This indicates that a project with the same name and slug already exists under the currently selected namespace. Since the requirement is to keep the repository name as "fun_thing_to_do", the best approach is to change the project’s namespace to one where this name isn't already used.

The user wants a repository named "fun_thing_to_do" with an initialized README. I'm on the "Create blank project" form, but the previous submission failed due to duplicates: "Name has already been taken" and "Path has already been taken" within the current namespace. To keep the project name unchanged, the typical fix is to change the project namespace to one where "fun_thing_to_do" isn't used. The namespace selector button [284] (currently showing "x-lab1") is collapsed (expanded=False). I should open the namespace dropdown to select a different namespace (ideally my personal "Byte Blaze") and then re-submit. The next best step is to click the namespace selector to open the menu.

The repository "fun_thing_to_do" is already created and currently open, showing README.md with default template content. The remaining requirement is to add links to the most active 5 DIY ideas from the DIY subreddit (on the internal forum site). To gather those links, I should navigate to the Reddit-like forum at 10.177.37.113:9999, find the DIY forum, use sorting/filters to identify the most active posts, copy their "comments" permalinks, and then return to GitLab to edit README.md and commit the changes to main.

To avoid losing the current GitLab page while I collect the links, I'll open a new browser tab and then navigate to the forum site in the subsequent step. Opening a new tab is the optimal single next action now.

The user’s goal is to create a repository and include a README with links to the most active 5 DIY ideas from the DIY forum. The GitLab repo is already created (Tab 0), and I'm currently on the DIY forum listing (Tab 1). I need to collect the “comments” permalinks for the five most active DIY idea posts. The listing shows comment counts, which I’ll use as a proxy for “most active.” Among idea-style posts, the top by comments are:

- I made a honeycomb firewood rack — 206 comments [276]
- I made a makeup table... — 173 comments [200]

- I built a shed this summer — 155 comments [352]
- Dashcam install to Subaru Legacy with hidden wires — 120 comments [464]

To easily capture URLs, it's best to open each “comments” link in a new tab (using ControlOrMeta modifier). Then I can review the open tabs list to note each URL and later edit the README in the GitLab repo. I’ll start by opening the highest one (206 comments) in a new tab.

Goal: Create repo "fun_thing_to_do" and add a README with links to the most active 5 DIY ideas from the DIY forum. The repo is already created. I’m on the detail page for one DIY post ("I made a honeycomb firewood rack"), which shows a "Short URL: http://10.177.37.113:9999/54219" in the sidebar. I should capture this URL as one of the five links before navigating back to the forum listing to gather the other four. Since only one action is allowed per step, the best immediate action is to store this short URL using take_note, so I can compile them later into the README.

Goal: Create repo "fun_thing_to_do" and add a README with links to the most active 5 DIY ideas from the DIY forum. The repo is already created. I’m on the detail page for one DIY post ("I made a honeycomb firewood rack"), which shows a "Short URL: http://10.177.37.113:9999/54219" in the sidebar. I should capture this URL as one of the five links before navigating back to the forum listing to gather the other four. Since only one action is allowed per step, the best immediate action is to store this short URL using take_note, so I can compile them later into the README.

✅ Current Progress:
- Created GitLab repository “fun_thing_to_do” with an initialized README.
- Collected 1 of the 5 required DIY links: http://10.177.37.113:9999/54219.
- README has not yet been updated with the links.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is the comments thread for a DIY submission (“I made a honeycomb firewood rack”), which is relevant for capturing a valid post permalink.
- Relevant interactive elements for progressing:
  - Link “/f/DIY” (node [120], visible, enabled) — returns to the DIY forum listing to select additional active posts.
  - Searchbox “Search query” (node [57], visible, enabled) — optional for locating posts.
  - Link “206 comments” (node [146], visible, enabled) — identifies activity but not needed for collecting other posts.
  - Comment textbox “Comment” (node [173], enabled, empty) and “Post” button (node [313]) — not required for the task.
- The page is on the critical path to gather the remaining links; no errors or detours detected.

The goal is to compile links to the 5 most active DIY ideas and add them to the README in the "fun_thing_to_do" GitLab repository. I already captured the first post’s short URL from the current post detail page. To gather the remaining four, I should return to the DIY forum listing where the posts and their comment counts are visible so I can open the top posts’ “comments” pages and note their short URLs. Since we have a dedicated listing tab (Tab 1: DIY), the most direct way is to switch to that tab using tab_focus(1), rather than navigating within the current page. This sets me up to click the other top “comments” links next.

The task is to create a GitLab repository named "fun_thing_to_do" and populate its README with links to the most active 5 DIY ideas from the DIY forum. The repository has already been created and initialized with README. I have collected 2 short URLs so far and navigated to the detail page for "Old disgusting bathroom gets a makeover (reupload)". The current page's sidebar shows the Short URL: http://10.177.37.113:9999/76102. To keep organized and ensure I can later paste these into the README, I should record this third link using take_note. After that, I will return to the DIY forum list to collect two more high-activity post links (likely "I built a shed this summer" and "Dashcam install...") and then edit the README in the GitLab repo. The immediate next action is to save the third link in the notes.

The task is to create a GitLab repository named "fun_thing_to_do" and populate its README with links to the most active 5 DIY ideas from the DIY forum. The repository has already been created and initialized with README. I have collected 2 short URLs so far and navigated to the detail page for "Old disgusting bathroom gets a makeover (reupload)". The current page's sidebar shows the Short URL: http://10.177.37.113:9999/76102. To keep organized and ensure I can later paste these into the README, I should record this third link using take_note. After that, I will return to the DIY forum list to collect two more high-activity post links (likely "I built a shed this summer" and "Dashcam install...") and then edit the README in the GitLab repo. The immediate next action is to save the third link in the notes.

The goal is to finish collecting links to the 5 most active DIY ideas and then add them to the README in the GitLab repository "fun_thing_to_do". I’ve already captured 3 short URLs from DIY post pages. I’m currently on the detail page for “Old disgusting bathroom gets a makeover (reupload)”, which has the breadcrumb link “/f/DIY” (bid 120) to return to the DIY forum listing. From that listing, I can identify other high-activity posts (e.g., “I built a shed this summer” with 155 comments and “Dashcam install...” with 120) and open their comments pages to record their short URLs. The next step is to navigate back to the forum overview to access those posts.
