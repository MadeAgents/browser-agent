✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “List of forums” directory. Not yet on the “gadgets” forum page; no voting action performed.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward the goal; you need to locate and open the “gadgets” forum first.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Search field: searchbox labeled “Search query” (id: 50), visible and empty; can be used to find “gadgets”.
  - Navigation filters: link “Alphabetical” (id: 117), visible/clickable; may help locate “gadgets”.
  - Pagination controls at the bottom: “Previous” (id: 645), page “1” (id: 647, current), “2” (id: 649), “3” (id: 651), “4” (id: 653), and “Next” (id: 655); all visible/clickable for browsing more forums.
  - Forum entries are links (e.g., “technology — technology” link id: 304), confirming the pattern you’ll use once “gadgets” appears.
- To achieve the goal, the next milestones after finding “gadgets” will be: open its page, sort posts to Top/All time, then downvote the first post.

The user’s goal is to thumbs down (downvote) the top 1 post ever in the “gadgets” forum. I’m currently on the List of forums page with navigation options including a link labeled “Alphabetical” (id 117). Based on the task tips, the best way to find a specific forum is to use the Alphabetical listing in the Forums tab. While there is a search box, it may search submissions rather than forum names; the explicit tip #2 advises clicking Alphabetical to find forum names. Therefore, the next optimal step is to click the “Alphabetical” link to switch the forums list to alphabetical order, which will help me locate “gadgets” more efficiently (likely then using pagination to navigate to the letter G).

The user wants to thumbs down the top 1 post ever in the gadgets forum. I’m already on the gadgets forum page with the URL indicating it’s sorted by Top and the time range is All time (/f/gadgets/top?t=all). The first article listed is the top post with the title “A custom gaming PC built inside a vintage 1940s Motorola radio case.” In its action section, the “Downvote” button is present with bid 196. To fulfill the goal, I should click this specific Downvote button for the top post. No need to change sorting or navigate elsewhere, and I should avoid redundant actions.
