The user wants me to "Fork all source repos from Akilesh Kannan." I need to find projects owned by the user Akilesh Kannan and then fork each of them. Starting from the dashboard, there is an "Explore" tab that lists all repositories across the GitLab instance and provides a "Filter by name" field. The global search bar is not working per tips, but the Explore page’s filter should help find repositories by name/namespace. The first step is to navigate to the Explore view so I can search/filter for repos belonging to Akilesh Kannan. On the current page, I see the Explore tab link with bid [268]. I will click Explore to access the list of all projects and then I can use the filter to search for "Akilesh" or "Akilesh Kannan".

✅ Current Progress: Arrived on the Projects › Explore page. No repositories from Akilesh Kannan have been located or forked yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path, as it provides a “Filter by name” search to find projects by owner/namespace.
- Search/Filter:
  - [254] searchbox “Filter by name” — visible, editable, currently empty.
  - [300] button “Any” (Visibility filter, hasPopup=listbox) — visible, enabled.
  - [292] link “All” and [294] link “Most stars” — visible; category filters.
- Global search:
  - [111] textbox “Search GitLab” — visible; can perform a site-wide search.
- The project list currently shows general repositories unrelated to Akilesh Kannan. No “Fork” actions are present on this listing page; forking will occur after navigating into each target repository.

The task is to fork all repositories owned by "Akilesh Kannan." I’m currently on the Explore Projects page, which has a “Filter by name” search box [254] that can help narrow down repositories by name/namespace. The global search bar is noted as not working, so using the page-specific filter is the best next step. By entering "Akilesh Kannan" (or "Akilesh") into the filter, the list should display projects under that namespace, enabling me to click into each repository and fork them. The previous attempt to click Explore timed out but I’m already on the Explore page, so the next logical action is to use the filter box to find Akilesh Kannan’s repositories.

The goal is to fork all source repositories from the user "Akilesh Kannan." I’m on the Explore Projects page, which includes a "Filter by name" search box (bid 254). Previously, I entered "Akilesh Kannan" and pressed Enter, but the results still display general popular repositories, suggesting either the query returned no matches or the filter requires a simpler keyword. To increase the chance of matching, I should try a broader query, such as "Akilesh," which could surface projects under that namespace or with that owner name. Using the page-specific filter aligns with the task tips and avoids the global search bar. The next best step is to replace the filter text with "Akilesh" to attempt to find repositories belonging to this user; if matches appear, I can then proceed to open each project and fork them. I will perform the fill action now and then, in a subsequent step, press Enter if needed.

The next best step is to replace the filter text with "Akilesh" to attempt to find repositories belonging to this user; if matches appear, I can then proceed to open each project and fork them. I will perform the fill action now and then, in a subsequent step, press Enter if needed.

The form shows a “Select a namespace” dropdown button [518] that’s currently collapsed (expanded=False). The best next step is to open this dropdown to choose the correct namespace before clicking "Fork project."

The goal is to fork Akilesh Kannan’s repositories. I’m currently on the “Fork project” page for CacheEval under the aklsh namespace with the destination namespace set to “byteblaze.” The “Fork project” button [618] is disabled, likely due to a validation issue or a slug conflict (e.g., a project with the same slug already exists in my namespace). A common resolution is to modify the “Project slug” to a unique, valid value to re-enable the button. The slug field [581] is editable, so I’ll change it to a unique lowercase slug like “cacheeval-aklsh” to avoid conflicts and potentially enable the Fork button.

The destination namespace is already set to “byteblaze,” and I changed the Project slug to “cacheeval-aklsh.” However, the “Fork project” button remains disabled, which suggests the form hasn’t revalidated after editing the slug. The slug field [581] is currently focused. Typically, blurring the field (e.g., by pressing Tab) triggers validation and can enable the submit button. Therefore, the best next step is to press Tab on the slug field to move focus and trigger form validation, which may enable the “Fork project” button so I can proceed.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Akilesh Kannan’s profile and opened the “CacheEval” repository.
- Entered the fork flow and selected destination namespace “byteblaze” via button [518].
- Dismissed a prior fork error and updated the “Project slug” to “cacheeval-aklsh” in textbox [581]; attempted to trigger validation by moving focus.
- No fork has been created yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (“Fork project · Akilesh Kannan / CacheEval · GitLab”) is directly on the critical path for the goal.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - [508] textbox “Project name” — value “CacheEval”, required, filled, visible.
  - [518] button “byteblaze” (namespace selector) — visible, hasPopup=menu, expanded=False; shows “byteblaze”.
  - [581] textbox “Project slug” — value “cacheeval-aklsh”, required, filled, visible.
  - [587] textbox “Project description (optional)” — prefilled, visible.
  - [590]/[592] “Visibility level” group — radio options visible.
  - [618] button “Fork project” — visible; enablement state not indicated in the axtree.
- The page is appropriate and aligned with the goal of forking this repository before proceeding to the remaining projects.

The user’s goal is to fork all source repositories from Akilesh Kannan. I navigated to the CacheEval repository’s fork form and selected the destination namespace “byteblaze.” However, the “Fork project” button [618] remains disabled even after changing the project slug to “cacheeval-aklsh” and attempting to trigger validation by tabbing out of the field. This suggests the form may not have registered the namespace selection or needs a re-selection to revalidate. The “Project URL” section shows a button [518] for selecting the namespace, currently collapsed (expanded=False) and labeled “byteblaze.” To ensure the namespace selection is properly applied and potentially enable the “Fork project” button, the best next step is to open the namespace dropdown again. After that, I can select “byteblaze” explicitly in the subsequent step if needed.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page “Fork project · Akilesh Kannan / CacheEval · GitLab” is directly on the critical path to the goal.

  - Visibility options — radio buttons present (labels include Private/Internal/Public), visible.
  - [618] button “Fork project” — visible (enabled state not confirmed from axtree).
- Context: A previous fork attempt produced an error (“An error occurred while forking the project. Please try again.”). The form is still open with editable fields, indicating the fork can be retried after resolving validation (e.g., unique slug/namespace confirmation).

The goal is to fork Akilesh Kannan’s repositories, starting with CacheEval. I’m on the “Fork project” form where the “Fork project” button [618] is disabled. This typically indicates a validation issue. My previous attempt to click the “Internal” radio input [603] timed out because the associated label [604] intercepts pointer events, meaning the label is the correct target to change the selection. Toggling the visibility radio option can re-trigger form validation, which may enable the “Fork project” button. Therefore, I will click the “Internal” label [604] to change the visibility and trigger validation.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Akilesh Kannan’s profile and identified multiple repositories (e.g., CacheEval, empathy-prompts, nvidia-patch, SimCache, viewgrades-scraper, dots).
- Opened the “CacheEval” repository and reached its “Fork project” page.
- Selected destination namespace “byteblaze” and edited the project slug to “cacheeval-aklsh-1.”
- Attempted to fork once; an error was shown. No repository has been successfully forked yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page “Fork project · Akilesh Kannan / CacheEval · GitLab” is directly on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - [508] textbox “Project name” — value “CacheEval”, required, filled, visible.
  - [518] button “byteblaze” (namespace selector) — hasPopup=menu, expanded=False, visible; currently shows “byteblaze.”
  - [581] textbox “Project slug” — value “cacheeval-aklsh-1”, required, editable, visible.
  - [587] textbox “Project description (optional)” — filled, editable, visible.
  - Visibility radio group — options visible; “Internal” appears selected (radio near [607]).
  - [618] button “Fork project” — visible; enabled state not indicated by the axtree. A previous attempt produced an error.
- The current page is appropriate; no off-track indicators. Form likely needs valid inputs/validation to proceed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Type a unique slug into textbox [581] (e.g., “cacheeval-aklsh-2”), then click button [618] “Fork project”.

The objective is to fork all repositories from Akilesh Kannan. I’m currently on the “Fork project” page for the CacheEval repo. The “Fork project” button is disabled, which usually indicates a validation issue—often due to a conflicting slug already existing in my namespace. The slug field is editable and currently set to “cacheeval-aklsh-1.” To attempt to resolve the validation and enable the button, I will change the slug to a clearly unique value. After updating the slug, I can trigger validation (if needed) in the next step. Therefore, the best immediate action is to fill the slug textbox with a unique value like “cacheeval-aklsh-2.”

The user’s goal is to fork all source repositories from Akilesh Kannan, and I’m on the “Fork project” form for the CacheEval repo. The “Fork project” button is currently disabled, which typically indicates a validation issue—most commonly a slug conflict if a project with the same slug already exists under my namespace (byteblaze). The “Project slug” field shows “cache-eval-aklsh,” which may already exist from a previous fork attempt. To resolve this and enable the submit button, the best next step is to change the slug to a unique value. I will update the slug to “cache-eval-aklsh-fork,” which should avoid conflicts and potentially re-enable the “Fork project” button once the form revalidates.

The “Fork project” button is currently disabled, which typically indicates a validation issue—most commonly a slug conflict if a project with the same slug already exists under my namespace (byteblaze). The “Project slug” field shows “cache-eval-aklsh,” which may already exist from a previous fork attempt. To resolve this and enable the submit button, the best next step is to change the slug to a unique value. I will update the slug to “cache-eval-aklsh-fork,” which should avoid conflicts and potentially re-enable the “Fork project” button once the form revalidates.

The user wants me to fork all source repositories from Akilesh Kannan. I’m currently on the “Fork project” page for the repository CacheEval. The namespace “byteblaze” is selected, visibility is set to Public, and the Project slug is “cache-eval-aklsh-fork.” However, the “Fork project” button appears disabled, and previous attempts to re-enable it by changing the slug and toggling visibility did not help. A likely cause is a validation requirement or a naming conflict; changing the Project name to a unique value often re-triggers validation and can enable the submit button. The Project name field [508] is editable and currently “CacheEval aklsh,” so I will change it to a unique name like “CacheEval aklsh fork” to attempt to re-enable the Fork button.

The task is to fork all source repositories from Akilesh Kannan. I am on the "Fork project" page for the CacheEval repository, but the "Fork project" button is disabled despite having filled out the required fields and selecting the namespace. Multiple attempts to adjust the slug, name, and visibility did not enable the button, which suggests a validation or state issue on this particular fork form. To continue making progress toward the overall goal, I should navigate back to Akilesh Kannan’s profile and proceed to fork other repositories first, then revisit CacheEval later. The breadcrumbs at the top include a link "Akilesh Kannan" [484] that will take me back to the user's profile page listing all their repositories. Clicking this will enable me to continue forking the remaining projects.
