The user wants the product with the lowest per unit price among the three currently open tabs added to the cart. I need to compare prices and unit counts for each tab. I can see the active tab (Tab 2) shows a set of 2 sconces priced at $28.99, but I don't know the prices for Tab 0 and Tab 1 yet. The best next step is to switch to Tab 0 to check its price and unit count (it appears to be a 4-piece set). Then I'll also check Tab 1 and compute per unit prices to decide which is lowest before adding that one to the cart. I'll use the tab_focus action to switch to Tab 0.

The goal is to add the product with the lowest per unit price from the three open tabs to the cart. I already calculated Tab 0’s per-unit price: $19.90 for 4 pieces, which is $4.975 per unit. To compare, I need the price and unit count from the other tabs. The next efficient step is to switch to Tab 1 (SPAAS White Taper Candles - 4 Pack) to read its total price and confirm unit count, then compute its per-unit price. After that, I will check Tab 2 if needed and then add the lowest per-unit item to the cart. I’ll bring Tab 1 to the foreground now.

The user wants the product with the lowest per unit price among the three open tabs added to the cart. I’ve already identified Tab 1 (SPAAS White Taper Candles - 4 Pack) priced at $11.99, which implies a per-unit price of $11.99 / 4 = $2.9975. From prior context, Tab 0 was noted at $19.90 for 4 pieces (~$4.975/unit). However, to be certain that Tab 1 is indeed the lowest, I should verify Tab 2’s price and unit count. Tab 2 is a “White Starfish Wall Candle Sconces (Set of 2)”, and the price should be visible near the top of its product page. The most efficient next step is to switch to Tab 2 to read its price, compute per-unit price ($price / 2), and compare with $2.9975. Based on that, I’ll decide which product to add to cart in the following step.

The goal is to add the product with the lowest per unit price to the cart. From the active tab (Tab 2), I see the sconces are $28.99 for a set of 2, which is $14.495 per unit—this is not the lowest. Earlier, I checked the other tabs: Tab 0 appears to be a 4-piece set at $19.90 (~$4.975/unit), and Tab 1 (SPAAS White Taper Candles - 4 Pack) was observed at $11.99 (~$2.9975/unit), making Tab 1 the lowest per unit. To proceed, I should switch to Tab 1 to access its product page and then click the "Add to Cart" button there.
