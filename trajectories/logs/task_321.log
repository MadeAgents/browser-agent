The user is logged in (shows “Welcome, Emma Lopez!”). To find the refund amount for orders canceled in 2022, I should go to the account area and look for order history. Per the site tips, the path is My Account > My Orders. On the current homepage, there’s a “My Account” link in the header (accessibility node [227]). Clicking it should take me to the account dashboard where I can access orders and then filter or locate orders from 2022 with a “canceled” status. From there, I’ll identify the canceled order(s) in 2022 and read the totals (including shipping). The best next step is to click “My Account.”

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to determine the refund for a canceled 2022 order. Relevant interactive elements (from the accessibility tree):
- Main heading “My Orders” [1356] confirming correct section.
- Orders table “Orders” [1362] with columns “Order #” [1366], “Date” [1367], “Order Total” [1368], “Status” [1369], and “Action” [1370].
- “View Order” links in the Action column (enabled/visible): rows include [1379], [1390], [1401] (and similar for other rows). These are needed to open specific order details to see totals and shipping.
- Current visible rows (e.g., row [1372]) show Date “12/16/25” and Status “Pending,” which are not the target (2022 canceled). The page likely requires paging to older orders before locating a 2022 canceled entry.
