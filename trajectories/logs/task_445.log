The user wants to update the site title to "Hello" in index.html and commit the change. I’m on the GitLab inline editor for index.html on the main branch. The editor shows the <title>Title Wanted</title> tag. The Find panel is open and already searching for “Title Wanted” with 1 of 1 match. The Replace panel is toggled open as well, showing an empty Replace textbox along with Replace and Replace All buttons. 

To proceed, I should input “Hello” into the Replace field so I can replace the matched “Title Wanted” text. After that, I’ll use the Replace (or Replace All) button to perform the change, then commit. Since only a single action is allowed per step, the immediate next best action is to fill the Replace field with "Hello".

The user wants the project's site title updated to "Hello" in index.html. I am on the GitLab inline editor page for index.html on the main branch. The editor shows a find/replace panel where "Title Wanted" is the search term (1 of 1 match) and the Replace field is already filled with "Hello". To perform the change in the file, I should execute the replacement action. The UI provides two buttons: "Replace (Enter)" and "Replace All (Ctrl+Alt+Enter)". Since there is only 1 match, using "Replace All" will apply the change safely and ensure no occurrences are missed. After this, I will proceed to commit the changes in subsequent steps.
