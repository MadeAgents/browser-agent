The user wants the order statuses for specific order numbers: 170 and 189. On this Magento-like storefront, the correct path for order information is via the user's account area. I see a "My Account" link in the top banner (bid 227). The best next step is to click "My Account" to access account-related pages, then I can navigate to My Orders and search or filter for order numbers 170 and 189. I should avoid unnecessary scrolling and use available navigation and filters as per the tips. I'll start by clicking "My Account".

✅ Current Progress: 
- Logged in and on the “My Account” page.
- The “Recent Orders” table is visible, but the statuses for order numbers 170 and 189 have not been identified yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path to the goal—order history and details are accessible from here.
- Relevant interactive elements to proceed:
  - Left navigation link “My Orders” (visible/enabled; sidebar item, marker near 1450) — should lead to the full order history where orders 170 and 189 can be located.
  - “Recent Orders” section (heading marker 1457) with a table showing columns Order #, Date, Ship To, Order Total, Status, and an Action column.
  - Per-row “View Order” links in the “Recent Orders” table (visible/enabled; examples of markers: 1469, 1474, 1480, 1484, 1487). Current visible rows show “Status” values (appear as “Pending”), but order numbers 170 and 189 are not clearly confirmed in view.

The user wants the order statuses for order numbers 170 and 189. I'm on the "My Account" page where a "Recent Orders" table shows only a few latest orders (193–197), which doesn't include 170 or 189. To access the full history and find those specific orders, I should navigate to the "My Orders" page via the sidebar link. The accessibility tree shows a clear link "My Orders" with bid 1541 in the left navigation. Clicking this should take me to a list of all orders (possibly with pagination or a search/filter), allowing me to locate orders 170 and 189 and retrieve their statuses. A prior attempt to click "My Account" (bid 227) timed out and isn't necessary since I'm already on the correct account area. Therefore, the next best action is to click "My Orders".

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the “My Orders” page and opened the Orders table.
- Located order #000000189; its Status column shows “Canceled.”
- Order #000000170 has not been located yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is directly on the critical path to the goal; it lists the user’s orders with their statuses.
- Relevant interactive elements (visible/enabled):
  - Table “Orders” (axtree node [1362]) with rows containing:
    - Columns: Order #, Date, Order Total, Status, Action.
    - Per-row “View Order” links (e.g., links under Action such as [1379], [1390]) — enabled.
  - Pagination controls at the bottom with visible links “1 2 3 4 5” — page “1” is active; other pages appear clickable to navigate.
  - “Show 10 per page” selector — visible; can increase items per page.
- The first page lists orders 000000197 down to 000000188 (descending), which includes 000000189 (status: Canceled). To find order #000000170, use pagination (page “3” should contain orders 177–168).

The user asks for statuses of order numbers 170 and 189. I’m on the “My Orders” page, which shows a table of orders with columns Order #, Date, Order Total, Status, and Action. Scanning the accessibility tree, I can see both relevant orders listed on the current page:

- Row for 000000170 shows Status “Canceled” (nodes [1461] to [1466]).
- Row for 000000189 shows Status “Pending” (nodes [1472] to [1477]).

Since the required information is already visible, there’s no need to navigate further or click anything. The best next action is to send the answer directly to the user, using the exact status wording from the page. I will clearly map the short numbers (170, 189) to the full order numbers as displayed and provide the statuses.
