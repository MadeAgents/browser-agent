The user needs a storage option for 11 Nintendo Switch game cards. On the One Stop Market homepage, the top navigation has a "Video Games" menu item (bid 1189) that likely contains subcategories relevant to Nintendo Switch accessories. Following the site tips to use dropdown menus for shopping tasks, the best next step is to hover over "Video Games" to reveal its subcategories, where I can then look for Nintendo Switch cases or storage accessories that would fit at least 11 cards (e.g., 12- or 24-slot cases).

✅ Current Progress: Hovered the “Video Games” category to reveal its sub-menu; “Nintendo Switch” subcategory is now visible for selection.

🔍 Current State Analysis: We are on the One Stop Market homepage, which is a valid starting point but not yet showing Nintendo Switch storage products. The path to the goal is available via the navigation menu.
- Relevant elements:
  - Menuitem “Video Games” (id 1189): visible; its sub-menu is displayed.
  - Sub-menuitem “Nintendo Switch” (id 1235): visible and clickable; this is the most direct next step toward finding Switch accessories/storage.
  - Search combobox labeled “Search” (id 386): visible and editable; the adjacent “Search” button (id 391) is currently disabled until text is entered.
- Assessment: On the critical path. Selecting “Nintendo Switch” should lead to category results where storage cases for game cards can be found. No errors or detours detected.

The user wants a storage option for 11 Nintendo Switch game cards. I should navigate to the Nintendo Switch category using the top navigation menu rather than the search bar, per the tips. I already hovered over "Video Games" and the submenu displays, including a "Nintendo Switch" item (bid 1235). The logical next step is to click "Nintendo Switch" to access products for that platform, where I can then look for storage cases/card holders that fit at least 11 cards (e.g., 12-slot or more).
