The user wants to compare walking and driving times between AMC Waterfront and the University of Pittsburgh using the current OpenStreetMap site. On the page, there is a link labeled "Find directions between two points" (bid 167), which is the appropriate entry point to open the routing panel with fields for start and end locations and options for travel modes (car, foot, etc.). According to the task tips, this is the correct approach rather than using external sites. My plan is:
1) Click the "Find directions between two points" link to open the directions interface.
2) Then enter "AMC Waterfront, Pittsburgh, PA" as the start and "University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA" as the destination.
3) Run the route for driving to get the time.
4) Switch the mode to walking to get its time.
5) Finally, compare the two times and report them as requested.

Since only a single action is allowed per step, the immediate next action is to click the directions link to bring up the routing panel.

The goal is to compare walking vs driving time between AMC Waterfront and University of Pittsburgh using the OpenStreetMap directions panel already open. The panel shows mode radio buttons (Car checked), and two textboxes labeled "From" [194] and "To" [199]. The first step is to enter the starting point. According to the task tips, specifying Pittsburgh, PA helps disambiguate. I will fill the "From" field with "AMC Waterfront, Pittsburgh, PA". After that, I’ll fill the "To" field with "University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA", then trigger routing, review the driving time, switch to Foot mode, and compare times.

- Attempted to set From = “AMC Waterfront, Pittsburgh, PA,” but a “Search failed” modal indicates it wasn’t found.
- To field is incorrectly set to a university in the United Kingdom (not the University of Pittsburgh).
- No route or times have been obtained yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:

  - Reverse Directions button [200]: visible/enabled.
- The current inputs are off-track due to an unrecognized origin and a wrong destination.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
1) Click button “Close” on the “Search failed” dialog [155].
2) Replace the From field [194] with “AMC Waterfront 22, West Homestead, PA”. After that, update the To field [199] to “University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA” before computing times.

The user wants a comparison of walking and driving times between AMC Waterfront and the University of Pittsburgh using the OpenStreetMap directions tool. The current page shows the directions panel already configured:
- Mode: Car (radio [173] checked)
- From: "AMC Waterfront 22, West Homestead, PA" (textbox [194])
- To: "University of Pittsburgh, 4200, Fifth Avenue, South Oakland, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15260, United States" (textbox [199])
However, I don’t see any route results (time/distance) in the accessibility tree. I notice a large “Welcome to OpenStreetMap!” overlay in the left pane with a Close button [217]. This overlay likely obscures where route results would normally render. To proceed and view the computed driving route info, I should close this overlay. After dismissing it, the driving route details should appear; then I can switch to Foot [179] for walking time and compare. For now, the best next single action is to click the Close button [217] to remove the overlay and reveal the route results.

The user’s goal is to compare walking vs driving times from AMC Waterfront to the University of Pittsburgh using the current OpenStreetMap directions page. The page is already set up with:
- From: AMC Waterfront 22, Waterfront Drive West, The Waterfront, West Homestead, PA 15120 (textbox [194])
- To: University of Pittsburgh, 4200 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 (textbox [199])
- Service: OSRM (combobox [182])
- Mode: Car (radio [173] checked)

The directions summary shows the driving route distance and time: 8.8km and 0:15 (gridcell [495], statuses [497] and [498]). To complete the comparison, I need the walking time by switching the mode to Foot. Previously I attempted to click the Foot radio [179], but the click failed due to the Car label [174] intercepting pointer events. A practical workaround is to click the Foot label itself ([180] LabelText 'Foot'), which should toggle the associated radio input to Foot and trigger recalculation of the route for walking.

Therefore, the next best single action is to click the Foot label [180] to select walking mode and get the updated time.
