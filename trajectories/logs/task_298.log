The user wants to show the most recent completed order page. According to the task tips, to find order information, I should navigate via My Account > My Orders. I'm currently on the homepage of One Stop Market, logged in as Emma Lopez, and I can see a "My Account" link in the header with bid [227]. The first step is to click "My Account" to reach the account dashboard, from which I can access orders and then locate the most recent completed order. I will click the "My Account" link.

The goal is to show the most recent completed order page. I'm currently on the My Account dashboard, which displays a "Recent Orders" table. I should identify the most recent order with status "Complete" and click its "View Order" link.

Examining the table rows:
- 000000170 (5/17/23) - Canceled
- 000000189 (5/2/23) - Pending
- 000000188 (5/2/23) - Pending
- 000000187 (5/2/23) - Pending
- 000000180 (3/11/23) - Complete

Only the last row shows status "Complete", making it the most recent completed order in the list. The action cell for that row contains a "View Order" link with bid [1601]. To display the order details page, I should click that link.
