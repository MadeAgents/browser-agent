The user asks which US states border Pennsylvania. I should use the OpenStreetMap interface to search for Pennsylvania and then identify bordering states. The page shows the OpenStreetMap homepage with a visible Search textbox (bid 162) and a Go button (bid 165). Following the tips, I should use the search bar rather than trying to navigate the map manually. The first step is to enter "Pennsylvania" into the search box. After that, I can click Go to load the location and then determine bordering states, possibly by zooming out or reading labels. For now, I will perform the fill action to input "Pennsylvania" into the search box.

✅ Current Progress: Entered the query “Pennsylvania” into the site’s search box.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is relevant for determining bordering states via a map view. The OpenStreetMap homepage is displayed with:
- Input: textbox labeled “Search” (id/index [162]), value='Pennsylvania', focused and editable.
- Action control: button “Go” ([165]), visible and enabled.
- Map controls (useful after locating Pennsylvania): “Zoom In” link ([434]), “Zoom Out” link ([436]), “Layers” ([442]), “Legend” ([445]).
Proceeding with “Go” should center the map on Pennsylvania, enabling identification of adjacent states.

The task is to identify which US states border Pennsylvania using the OpenStreetMap interface. The search box already contains "Pennsylvania" (textbox [162] shows value='Pennsylvania'), so the next logical step is to execute the search to center the map on Pennsylvania. From there, I can use the map labels and borders to determine neighboring states. To proceed, I should click the "Go" button (bid [165]) next to the search box to load Pennsylvania’s map view.

The user asks which US states border Pennsylvania. The OpenStreetMap page is already centered on Pennsylvania with search results visible. To answer, I don't need further navigation since this is general geographic knowledge and visible context from OSM confirms neighboring states. The correct list includes six states: New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, and Ohio. I will provide a concise list as the final answer using a single send_msg_to_user action.
