The user's goal is to find the bar around Carnegie Music Hall. According to the task tips, if the location name is not specific, we should look up the one in Pittsburgh, PA. We are on the OpenStreetMap site with the search box focused (element [162]). The best initial step is to use the search bar to locate "Carnegie Music Hall Pittsburgh, PA". After locating it, I can then look for nearby bar POIs or search for "bar near Carnegie Music Hall". For now, I will input the search query into the search field to retrieve the location first.

The user wants a bar around Carnegie Music Hall in Pittsburgh. The map is already centered on Carnegie Music Hall with the "Query features" tool active, but I don't see any clear bar icons within the current view. Using the search bar to query "bar near Carnegie Music Hall, Pittsburgh" will leverage Nominatim to list nearby bars without needing to pan or zoom (which may be limited). This approach aligns with the tips to use search and filters rather than scrolling. The next best step is to replace the current search text with a targeted query and then execute it.

- Used OpenStreetMap search for “bar near Carnegie Music Hall, Pittsburgh”; results show “No results found.”
- Map is centered on the Carnegie Music Hall area in Pittsburgh; two zoom-out actions have been performed.
- “Query features” tool was accessed earlier.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is relevant and on the critical path: it shows the Carnegie Music Hall vicinity (Forbes Ave, Schenley Plaza, Carnegie museums).
- Search panel status:
  - [509] “Search Results” with [514] “No results found” for the current query.
- Relevant interactive elements to progress:
  - [162] textbox “Search” — value: “bar near Carnegie Music Hall, Pittsburgh”; visible and editable.
  - [165] button “Go” — visible and enabled.
  - [209] button “Close” (results sidebar) — visible; can free map space for exploration.
  - [454] link “Query features” — visible; enables clicking POIs on the map to inspect tags (e.g., bar/pub).
  - [434] “Zoom In” and [436] “Zoom Out” (currently focused) — visible; adjust map detail to reveal nearby venues.
  - [442] “Layers”, [445] “Legend” — optional aids for POI visibility.
- Nearby visible POIs are mostly cafes/restaurants; no explicit “bar/pub” labels are currently shown at this zoom level. The map remains appropriate for locating nearby bars by querying features or refining the search (e.g., using “pub”/“tavern”).

The user wants a bar around Carnegie Music Hall in Pittsburgh. My previous query “bar near Carnegie Music Hall, Pittsburgh” returned “No results found” in the Nominatim Search Results panel. The map is centered in the Oakland area with Carnegie Music Hall visible, but no explicit bar POIs appear at the current zoom level. A practical next step is to try a synonym that Nominatim recognizes better, such as “pub,” which often matches OSM tags for bars/pubs. I will update the search box with “pub near Carnegie Music Hall, Pittsburgh” to retrieve nearby pubs, then in the following step I can click Go to execute the search and review the results.

The user's goal is to find a bar around Carnegie Music Hall.

Task: Find a bar around Carnegie Music Hall using OpenStreetMap. The initial searches using “bar near Carnegie Music Hall, Pittsburgh” and “pub near Carnegie Music Hall, Pittsburgh” returned no results in Nominatim. The map shows the Oakland area with Carnegie Music Hall visible, but I need to identify a nearby bar.

Strategy: Since free-form "near" queries failed, a more reliable approach is to search directly for a known nearby bar by name. Common bars near Carnegie Music Hall include Hemingway's Cafe on Forbes/Craig, Fuel and Fuddle, The Yard, and Panther Hollow Inn. I will try searching "Hemingway's Cafe, Pittsburgh" in the OSM search bar because it's a well-known bar in Oakland, close to Carnegie Music Hall. Once found, I can report it as a bar around Carnegie Music Hall. To proceed, I will fill the search box with “Hemingway's Cafe, Pittsburgh,” then, in the next step, click Go to execute the search.

The user asked to find the bar around Carnegie Music Hall. We’re on OpenStreetMap with the search results already showing a nearby bar: “Hemingway’s” classified as Pub, with its full address visible. Since the goal is to identify the bar and provide the address (and the site already provides the complete address including ZIP code), the most efficient next step is to deliver the answer directly to the user using send_msg_to_user rather than performing additional map interactions. This satisfies the task tips about using OpenStreetMap data and including a full address.
