The user wants the total duration for a two-leg trip using OpenStreetMap: 1) walking from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to Harvard University, then 2) driving from Harvard University to Boston Logan International Airport. On the current OpenStreetMap page, the search bar is present with a "Find directions between two points" link (with an icon that likely represents the two-arrow directions tool). Following the site tips, using the directions tool is the correct approach rather than scrolling. I will first open the directions interface, then input MIT as the start and Harvard University as the end, ensure walking mode is selected, and note the duration. Then I will switch the start to Harvard University and the destination to Boston Logan International Airport, switch to driving mode, and note the duration. If the tool doesn't support multi-leg within one view, I will do them sequentially and later sum the durations. The immediate next step is to click the "Find directions between two points" link to open the routing interface.

The goal is to compute durations for a two-leg trip: walk from MIT to Harvard University, then drive to Boston Logan International Airport, using OpenStreetMap's directions panel. The panel is already open with mode radios and From/To textboxes visible. The current mode is "Car" (radio [173] checked). I attempted to select the "Foot" radio ([179]), but the click was intercepted by the "Car" label, likely due to overlay or label positioning, resulting in a timeout. A common workaround is to click the label text instead of the radio input. The Accessibility Tree shows a "LabelText 'Foot'" element ([180]) associated with the Foot mode; clicking that should successfully switch to walking mode. After switching to Foot, I will fill the From and To fields with "Massachusetts Institute of Technology" and "Harvard University" to get the walking duration, then later switch to Car and set "From: Harvard University" and "To: Boston Logan International Airport" to get the driving duration and sum them. The immediate next best action is to click the "Foot" label text ([180]) to switch modes to walking.

The user needs the total duration for a two-leg trip: first walking from MIT to Harvard University, then driving to Boston Logan International Airport. The current OpenStreetMap directions panel already shows the first leg (walking) with Distance: 2.8km and Time: 0:37, confirming that the walking duration is obtained. Now I need to compute the second leg: driving from Harvard University to Boston Logan International Airport. To do this, I should switch the routing mode from Foot to Car, set From to Harvard University (which I can use the Reverse Directions button for, since the current To is Harvard University), and set To to Boston Logan International Airport, then trigger the route calculation to read the driving time.

Task: Determine total duration for a two-leg trip using OpenStreetMap:
1) Walk from MIT to Harvard University.
2) Drive from Harvard University to Boston Logan International Airport.
We need to use the directions panel, switching modes and setting correct From/To for each leg, then read durations and sum them.

Current page state:
- Directions panel open.
- Mode: Car (radio [173] checked).
- From [194]: "Albert H. Gordon Road, Allston, Boston, ... 02163" (Harvard Business School area).
- To [199]: "Amherst Alley, Cambridge, ... 02238" (MIT).
- Current route summary: Distance 3.5km, Time 0:09 (likely Harvard area → MIT by car).

To get the second leg (Harvard → Logan) first, I can change the To field to "Boston Logan International Airport" and compute the route. Using the existing From near Harvard is acceptable but I can refine later by changing From to "Harvard University" for precision if needed. Since only one action per step is allowed, the immediate action is to fill the "To" textbox with "Boston Logan International Airport" to set up the driving route, then later trigger calculation (press Enter) and read the time. After that, I’ll switch to Foot mode and set the walking route MIT → Harvard University to get that duration.

✅ Current Progress:
- First leg completed: Walking from Massachusetts Institute of Technology to Harvard University — duration recorded as 0:37.
- Second leg pending: Driving from Harvard University to Boston Logan International Airport — route not obtained due to an error.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The OpenStreetMap directions panel is open and is on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant elements and states:
  - Mode: [173] radio “Car” — checked=true (driving mode active).
  - Service: [182] combobox “Directions services” — value='OSRM' (collapsed).
  - Origin: [194] textbox “From” — value='Harvard University', focused, enabled.
  - Destination: [199] textbox “To” — value='Logan International Airport, 1, Harborside Drive, East Boston, Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, 02128, United States', enabled.
  - Status: Error banner under “Directions” reads “Couldn't find a route between those two places.”
- The page is relevant, but the current car route calculation failed and needs adjustment to proceed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Change routing service: Open combobox [182] “Directions services” and select option [186] “Valhalla” to retry calculating the car route Harvard University → Boston Logan International Airport.
- If the error persists, refine the start point to a drivable location: Type “Harvard Square, Cambridge, MA” into the “From” textbox [194] and press Enter to recalculate.

The user wants the total duration for a two-leg trip: 1) walking from MIT to Harvard University, and 2) driving from Harvard University to Boston Logan International Airport. We're using the OpenStreetMap directions panel visible on the current page.

From the current Accessibility Tree and screenshot:
- The directions panel is open.
- Mode is set to Car (radio checked=true), which is correct for the second leg.
- From: "Harvard University" (focused).
- To: "Logan International Airport, 1, Harborside Drive, East Boston, Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, 02128, United States".
- A red error banner states: "Couldn't find a route between those two places."

Earlier in the workflow, we successfully obtained the walking duration (0:37) for MIT → Harvard University. Now, we need to obtain the driving duration for Harvard University → Logan Airport. The current driving route calculation failed with OSRM. A common fix on this interface is to switch the routing engine to another service (e.g., Valhalla), which often succeeds when OSRM fails, especially when the start point is a campus centroid not directly on a drivable way.

The "Directions services" combobox (bid 182) shows options including "GraphHopper", "OSRM" (selected), and "Valhalla". Selecting "Valhalla" is likely to recompute the route and potentially succeed. The cleanest next step is to change the service to "Valhalla" using the combobox. I will use select_option to switch to "Valhalla" and prompt recalculation. If that still fails, I would next refine the start to "Harvard Square, Cambridge, MA," but first I’ll try the alternative engine.

Thus, the immediate single action is to select "Valhalla" in the routing service combobox (bid 182).

The user needs the total duration for two legs: 1) walk from MIT to Harvard University, and 2) drive from Harvard University to Boston Logan International Airport. We’re on OpenStreetMap’s directions panel. Currently:

This likely means the selected routing engine cannot find a drivable connection from the campus centroid. A common fix is to switch routing engines. The combobox lists GraphHopper, OSRM, and Valhalla. We already tried Valhalla earlier and then switched back to GraphHopper; now I’ll try OSRM to trigger a recalculation which often succeeds. After we get the driving duration, we can add it to the walking duration obtained earlier (0:37). Immediate next step: change the directions service to OSRM to recalc the driving leg.

The user asks for the total duration to first walk from MIT to Harvard University, then drive to Boston Logan International Airport. We’re on the OpenStreetMap directions page with the directions panel open. Currently, the route is set to Car mode with From = Harvard University and To = Logan International Airport, and the results show Distance: 13km, Time: 0:16 — so the driving leg duration is already available (16 minutes). 

Next, I must compute the walking duration from MIT to Harvard University. To do this, I need to configure the first leg: set From = Massachusetts Institute of Technology and To = Harvard University, then switch to Foot (walking) mode and read the time. Since only one action is allowed at a time, I will start by changing the From field to “Massachusetts Institute of Technology” (textbox bid 194). After that, I’ll set the To field to “Harvard University,” switch to Foot mode, and then read the walking time to sum with 0:16 already displayed for the driving segment.

We need the total duration for a two-leg trip:
1) Walk from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to Harvard University.
2) Drive from Harvard University to Boston Logan International Airport.

On the current OpenStreetMap directions panel:
- Mode radios are visible with Car checked (173 checked=true), Bicycle unchecked, Foot available (179 radio, 180 label).
- From (194) is "Massachusetts Institute of Technology".
- To (199) is "Logan International Airport, ... 02128".
- The summary shows a driving route with Distance: 13km, Time: 0:16 (this corresponds to the second leg, driving).

Next, I need to compute the walking leg (MIT → Harvard). To do that, I should switch the mode to Foot first, then set To = "Harvard University," and press Enter to compute the walking time. Since only one action is allowed per step, the immediate best action is to switch the routing mode to Foot by clicking the "Foot" label (bid 180). After that, I will enter "Harvard University" in the To field and press Enter to read the walking duration.

The user needs the total duration for two legs: walking from MIT to Harvard University, then driving to Boston Logan International Airport. We’re using the OpenStreetMap directions panel. Currently, the panel is set to Foot mode with From = “Massachusetts Institute of Technology” and To = “Harvard University.” However, the interface shows the error “Couldn't find a route between those two places,” and the routing engine selector (combobox “Directions services” [182]) is set to OSRM. Often, when OSRM fails to compute a walking route between two points, switching to another routing engine like Valhalla helps. The best next step is to change the routing service to “Valhalla” to try to obtain the walking route duration. If it doesn’t auto-recompute, I can press Enter in the To field afterward, but for now I will switch the service.
