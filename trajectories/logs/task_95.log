 <think>
The user needs the grand total of a specific invoice (000000002). In Magento Admin, invoice details are under Sales > Invoices. From the Dashboard, I should navigate to the Sales section to access invoices. The top horizontal menubar shows a "SALES" link (bid 156). Clicking it is the logical next step to reach the sales-related grids where I can then choose Invoices and search/filter for the invoice number. I won’t scroll as advised; instead, I’ll use navigation to get to Invoices and then utilize filters/search. The first step is to click SALES.

The user asks for the grand total of invoice 000000002. I’m on the Invoices grid in Magento Admin, which already displays the relevant rows and columns, including "Grand Total (Base)" and "Grand Total (Purchased)". In the row for invoice 000000002, both totals are clearly shown as $39.64. Since the needed information is visible directly in the grid, there’s no need to open the invoice detail page. The best next action is to provide the answer directly to the user.
