 <think>
The user asks for the top 1 search term. On the current Dashboard page, there is a "Top Search Terms" table showing search terms with "Results" and "Uses." Typically, "Top Search Terms" is sorted by "Uses" descending. The first row shows "hollister" with 19 Uses, which is the highest among the listed entries (others have 4, 2, 1, 1). Therefore, the top 1 search term is "hollister." I will provide the answer directly using send_msg_to_user.
