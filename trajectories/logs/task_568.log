The user wants me to invite Abishek and Vinta as collaborators to the a11yproject.com repository.

The next logical step is to navigate into that repository page by clicking its link, so I can access the Project information and Members to invite users.

The goal is to invite Abishek and Vinta as collaborators to the a11yproject.com repository. I’m on the Project members page with the “Invite members” modal open. From the accessibility tree, I can see an option chip “avatar Abishek S Close,” which indicates Abishek has been added to the invite list. The role is still set to the default “Guest,” and the “Invite” button is available. To proceed, I need to add Vinta as well by typing his name in the “Username or email address” textbox so the suggestion appears and can be selected in a subsequent step. After both are added, I will set the role to “Developer” (common collaborator level) and click “Invite.” The next best single action is to enter “Vinta” into the invite textbox.
