The user wants the customers who have expressed dissatisfaction with the "Olivia zip jacket." We are already on the Reviews grid in Magento Admin (MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews). The best approach is to use the grid filters to narrow to reviews for "Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket," then identify negative/unsatisfied ones by reading the review titles or text. The filter row includes a textbox under the "Product" column (bid 839) and a "Search" button (bid 700). First, I should fill the Product filter with "Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket" to isolate relevant reviews. After that, I will click "Search" in the next step.

The user wants the customers who have expressed dissatisfaction with the Olivia zip jacket. I’m already on the Reviews grid and have filled the Product filter textbox with “Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket” (field [839]). However, the filter hasn’t been applied yet as the grid still shows “351 records found.” The correct next step is to click the “Search” button to apply the product filter, which will narrow the results to this jacket’s reviews. Then I can identify dissatisfied customers by looking for negative-sentiment titles/text and collect their names. Therefore, I will click the Search button now.
