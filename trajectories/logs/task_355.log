The user wants products from the kids' bedding category sorted by descending price. Based on the site's navigation, subcategories are accessed via hover over the top menu.

The goal is to list products from the kids' bedding category sorted by descending price. Based on the site's navigation, we should use the top menu hover path. I already hovered over “Home & Kitchen” (id 708), and the submenu with “Bedding” (id 745) is visible. Since “Bedding” has a nested menu (hasPopup='menu'), the next step is to hover over “Bedding” to reveal further subcategories, where I expect to find “Kids' Bedding.” Once visible, I will click “Kids' Bedding” and then sort by price descending. For now, I will hover on “Bedding” to expose its sub-menu.
