The user wants reasons why customers like the "Olivia zip jacket." These reasons are typically found in customer review comments.

From there, I can filter reviews by product name to locate "Olivia Zip Jacket" reviews and read the text to extract reasons. 

Currently, I'm on the Dashboard. The horizontal top menu includes a "MARKETING" link. The logical next step is to click MARKETING to access the area where "User Content" and "All Reviews" should be available.

The user wants reasons why customers like the "Olivia zip jacket." We're on the Magento Admin Reviews grid, which includes a filter row for each column. I see at least one review row for the product “Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket” already, but to comprehensively gather reasons, I should filter the grid to only that product, then open each review to read the full text (since the “Review” column displays truncated snippets). 

In the filter row (row [805]), there are textboxes corresponding to different columns. After the “Type” filter combobox ([845]), there are two textboxes ([851] and [853]) which are likely the “Product” and “SKU” filters. To narrow down to the target product, I’ll fill the product filter textbox ([851]) with “Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket,” then I’ll click the Search button on the next step to apply the filter. This aligns with the benchmark tips: use search/filters rather than scrolling.

Next action: Fill the Product filter textbox with the product name.
