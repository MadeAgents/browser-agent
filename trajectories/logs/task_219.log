The user wants walking distances from nearby hotels to Pittsburgh International Airport that take at most 3 minutes. I should use the OpenStreetMap site’s search to locate Pittsburgh International Airport, then identify nearby hotels and use the directions tool (the “Find directions between two points” button) with the “Foot” profile to compute walking time/distance. I’ll start by searching for “Pittsburgh International Airport” to get the map centered on PIT. The search box is already focused and the “Go” button is visible. After that, I can look for hotels nearby and compute walking routes. First step: perform the search for the airport.

The task is to show walking distances from nearby hotels to Pittsburgh International Airport that take at most 3 minutes. On OpenStreetMap, the best approach is:
1) Center the map on “Pittsburgh International Airport” using the search.
2) Identify hotels very close to the terminal (≤ ~250m, assuming ~80–90 m/min walking speed).
3) Use the directions tool (foot profile) from each candidate hotel to the airport to get walking time/distance and keep only those ≤ 3 minutes.

The search box is already filled with “Pittsburgh International Airport” (element 162) and the “Go” button (165) is visible. The next logical step is to execute the search to bring up PIT’s location and nearby POIs. I will click the Go button to run the search.

The user's goal is to show walking distances from nearby hotels to Pittsburgh International Airport that take at most 3 minutes. I'm on the OpenStreetMap directions page with the routing panel open. The "To" field is already set to Pittsburgh International Airport. I need to change the transport mode from Car to Foot to get walking distances.

Previously, I attempted to click the radio button for "Foot" (bid 179), but the click was intercepted by the "Car" label (bid 174). A common workaround is to click the label text associated with the foot option instead of the radio input itself. The accessibility tree shows a LabelText 'Foot' with bid 180 immediately next to the foot radio. Clicking that should toggle the selection to Foot without being blocked by overlapping elements.

After switching to Foot, I can start entering nearby hotels in the "From" field and compute walking distances, but the immediate next step is to successfully change the mode to Foot.

The user wants walking distances from nearby hotels to Pittsburgh International Airport that are at most 3 minutes. I’m on the OpenStreetMap directions page with the routing panel open. The mode is set to Foot (radio ‘Foot’ is selected). The “To” field is already set to Pittsburgh International Airport, and the “From” field currently contains “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport,” which is a prime candidate likely within 3 minutes. On OSM, routes calculate after confirming the input—either by selecting a suggestion or pressing Enter in the input field. I don’t yet see a route summary in the accessibility tree, which suggests the route hasn’t been computed. Following the platform’s tip to use “press” to compute directions, the next immediate step is to press Enter on the “From” textbox to trigger the route calculation. Once the route is calculated, I can read the walking time and distance, and then proceed to compile results for hotels within 3 minutes.

Task: Find walking distances from nearby hotels to Pittsburgh International Airport that are at most 3 minutes. We must use the OpenStreetMap directions tool and foot routing. The panel is already open with mode Foot selected. Current From: Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport (1111 Airport Boulevard, 15231). Current To: “Pittsburgh International Airport, Clinton Road, ... 15126” which appears to target a western airport polygon node far from the terminal, causing an unrealistic long walking route (15km, 3:20). Likely OSRM is routing around restricted areas due to the chosen airport target.

Plan: Change the To destination to the actual terminal address so walking routing connects directly, e.g., “1000 Airport Boulevard, Pittsburgh, PA 15231” (the Landside Terminal), which should produce a very short walk from Hyatt and likely within 3 minutes. Next step: Replace the To field with the terminal address to recompute the route.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Press Enter in the “To” textbox [199] to recalculate the walking route with the updated destination.
- If the recalculated time still exceeds 3 minutes, switch the Directions service via the combobox [182] to “Valhalla” [186] and recalculate.

I tried clicking the “Valhalla” option in the “Directions services” combobox, but it failed due to visibility/scroll issues. Since the combobox is expanded and focused, a more reliable way is to change the routing service using the select_option action on the combobox, selecting “Valhalla.” This should recalculate the route with Valhalla and potentially yield a more accurate, shorter walking time appropriate for the hotel-to-terminal path.

✅ Current Progress:
- OpenStreetMap Directions panel is open and configured to walking (radio “Foot” [179] is checked).
- Routing service set to Valhalla (combobox “Directions services” [182], expanded; option “Valhalla” [186] selected).
- From: “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport …” ([194]).
- To: “Starbucks, 1000 Airport Boulevard, Pittsburgh …” ([199]).
- A route is calculated, but the summary shows Distance 2.1 km and Time 0:26 ([534]), which exceeds the ≤3 minutes requirement.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path: we have the walking router open with relevant origin/destination near the airport.
- Key interactive elements and states:
  - Mode radios: Car [173]=unchecked; Bicycle [176]=unchecked; Foot [179]=checked; all visible/enabled.
  - Directions services combobox [182]: value=Valhalla, expanded=True; options available—GraphHopper [184], OSRM [185], Valhalla [186]; enabled.
  - From textbox [194]: filled with the Hyatt; editable/visible.
  - To textbox [199]: filled with “Starbucks …” at the terminal; editable/visible.
  - Results summary [534]: “Distance: 2.1km. Time: 0:26.”
- The current result likely does not reflect a direct pedestrian path within the terminal complex (26 minutes is not plausible for Hyatt-to-terminal), so it does not satisfy the goal of ≤3 minutes.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- In the “To” input [199], type “Pittsburgh International Airport Landside Terminal” and press Enter to recalculate the walking route.
- If the time still exceeds 3 minutes, change the routing engine: in the expanded “Directions services” combobox [182], click option “GraphHopper” [184] to recalculate, then review the updated summary [534].

Goal: Provide walking distances from nearby hotels to Pittsburgh International Airport that are ≤3 minutes. We're on OpenStreetMap's directions page with Foot mode selected. Current route: From "Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport" to "Starbucks, 1000 Airport Boulevard" shows 2.1km, 0:26 (Valhalla). This is unrealistically long for Hyatt-to-terminal and likely due to routing constraints around the airport campus.

Strategy: Try a different routing engine to see if it resolves pedestrian connectivity around the terminal. The "Directions services" combobox [182] is open and currently set to Valhalla; options include GraphHopper and OSRM. We've already tried OSRM earlier (yielded ~0:29) and Valhalla (~0:26). Next best step is to switch to GraphHopper, which might better recognize the pedestrian bridge between the Hyatt and the terminal. If GraphHopper produces a ≤3 minutes route, we can use that. Therefore, select GraphHopper in the combobox to trigger recalculation.

Only one action is allowed, so I will use select_option on the directions services combobox to choose "GraphHopper".

The From field (bid 194) is currently filled with Starbucks; I should input “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport” there. After that, I can trigger calculation with Enter if needed. For now, the best single action is to fill the From textbox with the hotel name.

✅ Current Progress:
- OpenStreetMap Directions panel is open and set to walking (Foot radio [179] is selected).
- Destination “To” field [199] contains “Pittsburgh International Airport Landside Terminal.”
- A route summary is displayed (Distance 2.1 km, Time 0:25), which exceeds the ≤3 minutes requirement.
- No hotel-to-airport walking route has been correctly computed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is relevant for computing walking distances but current inputs are off-target and a modal is blocking.
- Blocking modal: “Search failed” dialog [147] with Close buttons [152] and [155] (visible; must be dismissed to proceed).
- Key elements in the directions panel:
  - Mode: Foot radio [179]=checked (visible/enabled).
  - Directions services combobox [182]=“Valhalla” (expanded=False; visible/enabled).
  - From textbox [194]=“پناهگاه حیات وحش میان کاله, … ایران” (visible/editable) — incorrect origin; not a hotel and not near Pittsburgh.
  - To textbox [199]=“Pittsburgh International Airport Landside Terminal” (visible/editable); the modal indicates this query failed to resolve reliably.
  - Reverse Directions button [200]=visible/enabled.
  - Result summary cells [536]=“2.1km”, [537]=“0:25” (does not meet ≤3 minutes).
- Deviation: The origin is a location in Iran (not a nearby hotel), and the modal indicates the destination search failed. Current route/time is irrelevant to the goal.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button [155] labeled “Close” to dismiss the “Search failed” dialog.
- Type “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport” into the From field [194] and press Enter to compute the walking route.

✅ Current Progress:
- OpenStreetMap Directions panel is open and set to walking (Foot mode selected).
- Origin (“From” textbox [194]) is “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport.”
- Destination (“To” textbox [199]) is “Pittsburgh International Airport Landside Terminal.”
- A route has been computed with Distance: 2.1 km and Time: 0:25 (25 minutes), which exceeds the ≤3 minutes requirement.
- A user-facing message was sent stating no qualifying hotels—this conclusion appears premature based on a single, likely misrouted result.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (OSM Directions) is on the critical path for evaluating walking distances from hotels to the airport.
- Relevant elements and state:
  - Mode radios: Foot [179]=checked (enabled/visible); Car [173]=unchecked; Bicycle [176]=unchecked.

  - Reverse Directions button [200]=visible/enabled.
  - Route summary: Distance status [536]=“2.1km”; Time status [537]=“0:25”.
- The computed path appears to route via roads/parking loops, suggesting the pedestrian connector may not be recognized by the current engine, producing an unrealistically long result. The earlier “No” answer was sent without validating alternative routing services or additional nearby hotels.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Switch routing engine to test pedestrian connectivity: Click the “Directions services” combobox [182] and select option “OSRM” [185] (if still long, try “GraphHopper” [184]); then re-check the Distance [536] and Time [537].
- Ensure correct POI selection for the hotel: Type “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport” into the “From” field [194] and press Enter to trigger recalculation; if still >3 minutes, try reversing the route with the “Reverse Directions” button [200] and reassess.
