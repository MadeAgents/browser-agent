The user wants the grand total of invoice 000000001. On Magento Admin, invoice details are under Sales > Invoices. From the current Dashboard page, the top navigation bar shows a "SALES" menu link (node [156]). The appropriate next step is to click the SALES menu to access its submenu (which typically includes Orders, Invoices, etc.), then navigate to Invoices where I can search for invoice 000000001 and view its grand total. Therefore, I will click the SALES menu link to proceed.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the “SALES” menu from the Magento Admin dashboard to access sales-related pages.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward the goal of finding the grand total for invoice 000000001. The SALES vertical menu is expanded and shows relevant navigation items:
- Link “Invoices” (node [171]) — visible and clickable.
- Link “Orders” (node [168]) — visible and clickable (not needed for this task).
Other visible elements (e.g., “Reload Data” button [714]) are unrelated to locating invoice totals. Proceeding to “Invoices” will allow searching for invoice 000000001 and viewing its grand total.

The goal is to find the grand total for invoice 000000001. From the Dashboard, the SALES menu has already been expanded, and I can see the "Invoices" link (node [171]). To locate the specific invoice and obtain its grand total, I should navigate to the Invoices page. There, I can use filters/search to find invoice 000000001 and then read its grand total from the grid or by opening the invoice detail. The next step is to click the "Invoices" link to access the invoice list.
