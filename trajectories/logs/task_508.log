The user's goal is to buy the highest rated product in the NS (Nintendo) Switch pouch category under $60. To locate that category efficiently, I should use the site's navigation menu rather than scrolling or searching. The vertical navigation shows a "Video Games" menu item [1076] which has a popup submenu. Per the site tips, hovering over categories reveals subcategories. So the next step is to hover over "Video Games" to expose subcategories like "Nintendo Switch," and then I can drill down to "Pouch" in subsequent steps.

✅ Current Progress: Hovered the “Video Games” category, revealing its submenu with “Nintendo Switch.”

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is the One Stop Market home with the main navigation visible, which is on the critical path to reach the Nintendo Switch pouch category. Relevant interactive elements:
- menuitem “Nintendo Switch” [1122] in the expanded “Video Games” submenu [1079]; visible and ready to navigate to the NS category.
- menuitem “Video Games” [1076]; submenu is currently shown (hovered/expanded).
- Search controls: combobox “Search” [273] (collapsed) and button “Search” [278] (disabled), so search is not usable right now.
- “Advanced Search” link [276] is visible but not necessary given the direct category path.
Product showcase items shown are general and not related to Nintendo Switch accessories/pouches. The next relevant element to use for progressing toward the goal is “Nintendo Switch” [1122].

The user's goal is to buy the highest rated product in the Nintendo Switch pouch category under $60. I already hovered over "Video Games" to reveal its submenu, and I can see the "Nintendo Switch" menu item [1122]. To reach the NS Switch category where I can then navigate to the specific "Pouch" subcategory, the next logical step is to click "Nintendo Switch." This should take me to the Nintendo Switch category page, from which I can look for the "Pouch" subcategory or filters to narrow down to pouches and then sort by rating and ensure the price is under $60.

- Product listing: Grid with “Items 1-12 of 51” [1384]; each tile has “Add to Cart” buttons (e.g., [1420], [1484], [1604], etc.), visible/enabled.
- Sorting controls: “Sort By” combobox [1390] (value=“Position”, expanded=False) with options “Product Name” and “Price”; “Set Descending Direction” link [1394], visible.
- Search controls: Top-page “Search” combobox [275] (autocomplete, expanded=False), “Search” button [280] disabled; “Advanced Search” link [278] visible.
- Left sidebar: “Shop By / Shopping Options” section is present but no specific filter options (e.g., “Pouch”) are listed in the provided accessibility tree, so a direct subcategory/filter for “Pouch” is not yet identified on this page.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “Nintendo Switch” category page; product grid is visible. No narrowing to the “pouch” subcategory and no sorting or price filtering applied yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path but currently lists mixed Nintendo Switch items (controllers, cables, accessories) rather than specifically “pouch.” Re-hovering the top “Video Games” menu is not leading to the “pouch” subcategory.
- Breadcrumbs confirm location: “Home” [1359] > “Video Games” [1361] > “Nintendo Switch” [1363].
- Key interactive elements:
  - Search field: combobox labeled “Search” [275], visible, currently empty; “Search” button [280] is disabled until text is entered.
  - Advanced Search link [278], visible.
  - Sorting: “Sort By” combobox [1390] (value=“Position”, expanded=False), “Set Descending Direction” link [1394], and “View as List” link [1382], all visible.
  - Product tiles with “Add to Cart” buttons (e.g., [1420], [1484], [1604]), visible/enabled.
- No explicit “Pouch” filter is visible in the left “Shopping Options,” so direct navigation via menu or filters is not currently available from this page.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Type “Nintendo Switch pouch” into the search field combobox [275], then click the “Search” button [280] (it will enable after typing) or press Enter to get pouch-specific results.
