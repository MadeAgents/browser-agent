The user wants me to find a GitLab repository related to ChatGPT and then make a Reddit-style post linking to it in a relevant subreddit (forum). On the current Postmill front page, I can see a submission titled "ChatGPT GitLab repository: Convex Eggtart / Chatgpt" which is clearly relevant. To include the exact URL in a new post’s Body (as per the Reddit task tips), I need to retrieve that precise URL. Clicking the post title would navigate to the external GitLab page, but extracting the URL text could be less straightforward from there. A better approach is to click the "Edit" link for this existing submission (submitted by our current user, MarvelsGrantMan136), which should open a form displaying the URL field directly. I can then read the exact URL to re-use it in a new submission. After I have the URL, I will click Submit and create a new post in the MachineLearning forum, placing the URL in the Body and leaving the URL field empty, as instructed. First step: click the "Edit" link for the ChatGPT GitLab submission to access the URL.
