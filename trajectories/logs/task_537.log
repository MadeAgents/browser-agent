 <think>
The user wants me to follow five specific users on GitLab. To follow a user, I’ll need to navigate to each user’s profile and click a Follow button if available. The most efficient way to locate user profiles is to use the site’s search functionality. The instructions warn that the global search bar is not working and instead provide a direct search URL format: http://10.177.37.113:8023/search?search=<repository-name>&nav_source=navbar. Although it’s described for repositories, GitLab’s search endpoint often returns various entity types (projects, groups, users). I will try using this search URL for the first name in the list, “Jakub Klinkovsk,” to locate the user profile from the search results. Once I land on the search page, I will look for a Users result and then proceed to the profile to follow them. This is a necessary first step before I can click a Follow button. Therefore, the next best single action is to navigate to the search URL for “Jakub Klinkovsk.”
