The user wants to update inventory for specific variants of a product: "Cora parachute pant" with two combinations: 12 for White size 28, and 56 for Blue size 29. In Magento Admin, inventory updates for specific variant options are typically done under CATALOG > Products by editing the configurable product and adjusting quantities for its associated simple products (variants) in the configurations grid or by opening the child products.

Currently, we are on the Dashboard. The first step is to navigate to the Products area. The top navigation has a "CATALOG" link with bid 189. Clicking that should bring up the products listing where I can search for "Cora parachute pant". From there, I will locate the configurable product and adjust the inventory for the specified variants. So the best next action is to click the CATALOG link to move to the Products page.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path for updating inventory. The grid displays product variants with columns including “Quantity” [1775] and “Salable Quantity” [1777].
- Active filter: “Keyword: Cora parachute pant” (visible in filter bar), confirming relevant results.
- Table [1743]: Visible with variant rows; target variants identifiable by visible text in the Name column [1765], e.g., “Parachute Pant-28-White” and “Parachute Pant-29-Blue.” These Name cells typically link to the product edit pages.
- Search textbox “Search by keyword” [1397]: visible and filled with “Cora parachute pant.”
- Button “Search” [1398]: visible and enabled.
- Per-page control [1433]: set to 200; pagination shows 1 of 1 [1463], so target variants should be on this page.

No inline quantity edit controls are apparent in the grid; updating inventory will likely require opening each variant (via its Name link) and adjusting quantity on the product edit page.

The goal is to update inventory for two variants of Cora Parachute Pant: White size 28 (+12) and Blue size 29 (+56). I already updated and saved the quantity for White size 28 to 112. Now I need to update the Blue size 29 variant. To access that variant’s edit page, the most direct path is to return to the products list where I previously saw “Cora Parachute Pant-29-Blue” with an Edit link. The Back button [899] on this page should take me back to the product grid filtered to Cora parachute pant, allowing me to select the Blue size 29 variant next. Therefore, the next best action is to click Back.
