The task is to add USPS tracking number 13849373987 to order #304. I’m on the “New Shipment” page for order 000000304, and the tracking section shows a row with fields for Carrier (combobox [1043]), Title [1050], Number [1052], and an Action icon [1054]. I already tried to select “United States Postal Service” by clicking option [1048], but it failed due to visibility timeout—likely because the dropdown option is not visible on screen and the environment cannot scroll.

To set the Carrier to USPS without relying on clicking a non-visible option, I should use keyboard navigation on the focused combobox. The combobox [1043] is expanded and focused. The options order is: Custom Value (selected), DHL, Federal Express, United Parcel Service, United States Postal Service. Pressing ArrowDown will move to the next option. I’ll start by pressing ArrowDown on the combobox to move selection from “Custom Value” to “DHL,” then continue with subsequent steps to reach USPS, followed by filling the tracking number and submitting shipment.

I previously attempted to select USPS via clicking the option and using select_option, but the combobox still shows “DHL,” suggesting the selection didn’t apply.
