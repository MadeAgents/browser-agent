The goal is to create a submission asking for advice about cheating in a relationships-related forum. We have already navigated to the correct forum (relationship_advice) and are on the "Create submission" page with the Title field filled. The next step is to put the content in the Body field and leave the URL field empty, as per the site-specific tips. The body should be a clear, respectful request for advice. I will fill the Body textbox (bid 143) with a detailed message, using newline characters for formatting. After this, I can proceed to click "Create submission" in the following step.
