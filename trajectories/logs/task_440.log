The user wants me to reorder a previously canceled makeup removal kit from summer 2022.

The user wants me to reorder a previously canceled makeup removal kit from summer 2022. On the My Account dashboard, the Recent Orders table shows only orders from 2023 and 2025, none from 2022. To locate summer 2022 orders, I should navigate to the full order history. The left sidebar contains a clear "My Orders" link [1637], which aligns with the site tip to use My Account > My Orders. Clicking "My Orders" will likely present the full list and possibly filters to find 2022 canceled orders.

The user wants me to reorder a previously canceled makeup removal kit from summer 2022. I’m on the “My Orders” page with a paginated table showing 10 out of 39 orders. The current page shows orders from 2023 and 2025, not 2022. To reach summer 2022, I should use pagination rather than scrolling (scrolling is discouraged and not supported). The pagination controls list Page 2 [1629], Page 3 [1633], Page 4 [1637], and Next [1641]. Since summer 2022 is likely among the oldest orders, Page 4 should contain the earliest orders (items 31–39 of 39). From there I can locate a canceled order dated around June–August 2022 and use the “Reorder” link for that order. The best immediate action is to click “Page 4”.

  - Link “Print Order” [1500]: visible/clickable; not directly helpful for reordering.

- Since this order does not include the makeup removal kit, using “Reorder” here would not meet the goal. The correct next step is to locate and view the other canceled summer 2022 order to confirm the makeup removal kit before reordering.

The user wants me to reorder a previously canceled makeup removal kit from summer 2022. I’m on the “My Orders” page showing the oldest orders (Items 31 to 39 of 39 total; currently reading page 4). There are two canceled orders in summer 2022: 000000149 (7/25/22) and 000000182 (6/30/22). I already viewed 000000149 and confirmed it does not include the makeup removal kit. Therefore, the likely match is the canceled order dated 6/30/22 (Order #000000182). To ensure I’m reordering the correct item and not an entire unrelated order, I should click “View Order” for #000000182 to verify the contents before using the “Reorder” action. The “View Order” link for this order is visible as element [1536].

To ensure we only reorder the kit (and not the other unrelated products), I need to remove the non-kit items from the cart before proceeding to checkout.

My last attempt to remove one non-kit item (using link [2145]) timed out after the click, likely due to a refresh/navigation delay.

The user wants me to reorder the makeup removal kit they canceled in summer 2022. I’ve already navigated to My Account > My Orders, identified the June 30, 2022 canceled order (#000000182) containing “The Body Shop Camomile Makeup Removing Kit,” and used the “Reorder” action, which added the kit to the cart. The current Shopping Cart shows two items: the desired “The Body Shop Camomile Makeup Removing Kit” and an unrelated “Nail Dryer Lamp.” To fulfill the user’s goal precisely, I should remove any non-kit items from the cart and then proceed to checkout. The accessibility tree shows the “Remove item” link for the Nail Dryer Lamp as element [1986]. My last click attempt was on a different element [2026] and timed out, so I will avoid repeating that and instead click [1986] to remove the Nail Dryer Lamp, leaving only the kit in the cart.

The user asked me to reorder the previously canceled makeup removal kit from summer 2022. I navigated to the canceled order (#000000182 from 6/30/22) containing “The Body Shop Camomile Makeup Removing Kit,” used the “Reorder” function, removed all non-kit items so only the kit remained, and proceeded to checkout. The current page is the Checkout page at the Shipping step. The Shipping Address is already selected, the Shipping Method “Fixed Flat Rate” ($5.00) is selected, and there is one item in the cart. To advance toward completing the reorder, the appropriate next action is to click the “Next” button to move to the Review & Payments step, where I can finalize the order. Since my last action (clicking Proceed to Checkout) timed out and I should avoid repeating the same action, clicking “Next” is the correct next step.
