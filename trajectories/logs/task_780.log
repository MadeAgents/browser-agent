🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is editing a different product (“Minerva LumaTech™ V-Tee-S-Blue”, heading id [836]) and is not directly related to the goal of updating “Ingrid Running” pricing for white color, size L and above.

The task is to increase the price of the white Ingrid Running product for sizes L and above by $17. On the Products grid filtered by "Ingrid Running," I can see all related variants. The relevant targets are:
- Ingrid Running Jacket-L-White (ID 1264)
- Ingrid Running Jacket-XL-White (ID 1267)

Both currently display a price of $101.00, suggesting they might already be adjusted, but to fulfill the instruction I should open each variant’s edit page and adjust the price based on the current value (increase by $17). The first step is to open the edit page for "Ingrid Running Jacket-L-White" via its "Edit" link to view and modify its Price field. Once on the edit page, I can read the current price, compute current + 17 using the calculate action, and update the value, then save. After that, I will repeat for the XL-White variant.

The user’s goal is to increase the price of the white Ingrid Running product for size L and above by $17. I have already:
- Updated L-White price from 101.00 to 118.00 (computed using calculate) and saved.
- Opened XL-White, computed 101.00 + 17 = 118.00 using calculate, filled the Price field with 118.00, and clicked Save.

To ensure the changes have been applied and verify if there are any additional white sizes above L (e.g., XXL), the best next step is to go back to the Products grid where I previously saw L-White and XL-White listed. From there, I can quickly confirm updated prices and check if there are any other applicable sizes in white that need adjustment. The “Back” button on the edit page should return me to the grid.

The user’s goal is to increase the price of the white Ingrid Running product for size L and above by $17. I have already:
- Updated L-White price from 101.00 to 118.00 (computed using calculate) and saved.
- Opened XL-White, computed 101.00 + 17 = 118.00 using calculate, filled the Price field with 118.00, and clicked Save.

The user’s goal is to increase the price of white Ingrid Running variants with size L and above by $17. I navigated to the Products grid filtered by “Ingrid Running” and identified the relevant white variants:
- Ingrid Running Jacket-L-White (ID 1264, SKU WJ04-L-White)
- Ingrid Running Jacket-XL-White (ID 1267, SKU WJ04-XL-White)

I opened each variant’s edit page, used calculate() to add 17 to the current price, updated the Price field to 118.00, and saved. The Products grid now shows both L-White and XL-White at $118.00 with recent updated timestamps, confirming the changes. There are no additional white sizes above L beyond XL in the grid (no XXL present). The best next step is to inform the user that the task has been completed and provide the specifics (variants and new prices).
