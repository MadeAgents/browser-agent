 <think>
The user wants the description page of the Costco in Pittsburgh near a river on OpenStreetMap. I'm on the OpenStreetMap homepage with the search textbox focused (bid 162), and a Go button (bid 165). The first step is to search for Costco in Pittsburgh to get a list of results. Then I can identify which result is near a river and open its description page. Following the benchmark tips, using the search bar is the most efficient approach rather than navigating the map manually. I will enter a search query like "Costco Pittsburgh, PA" into the search field. Since only one action is allowed per step, I will fill the search field first and then, in the next step, click Go to see results.

✅ Current Progress: Entered the search query “Costco Pittsburgh, PA” into the Search textbox.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap’s main interface and is on the critical path to find and open the Costco place description. Relevant elements:
- Textbox labeled “Search” (node [162]): value set to “Costco Pittsburgh, PA”, focused, visible.
- Button “Go” (node [165]): visible; likely used to execute the search.
- Button “Close” (node [217]): visible; closes the welcome panel that overlays part of the map (not strictly required for search).
- Link “Query features” (node [454]): visible; useful after navigating to the Costco location to open its feature details.

No deviation detected; the next step is to run the search from the current page.

The task is to open the description page for the Costco in Pittsburgh that is near a river using OpenStreetMap. The search textbox is already filled with "Costco Pittsburgh, PA" and focused (element [162]). The next logical step is to execute the search to get a list of Costco locations in the Pittsburgh area. From there, I can identify which one is near a river (likely the Waterfront/Homestead location by the Monongahela River) and open its details. To proceed, I should click the "Go" button (element [165]) to run the search.
