The goal is to post in the DIY forum with the exact title text provided by the user. I’m on the DIY forum’s “Create submission” page, and the Forum field is correctly pre-filled to DIY, as required by the workflow tips. The Title field has already been filled exactly with “what could midjourney help the corresponding field.” The URL radio is selected, but per the task tips, I should leave the URL field empty and put any content in the Body field; since the user didn’t provide additional body content, leaving it empty is acceptable. The Title is the only required field indicated (“Title *”). To complete the post creation, the next step is to submit the form by clicking “Create submission.”

The user's goal is to post in the DIY forum with the content “what could midjourney help the corresponding field.” I have already created the submission and can see it on the post detail page in /f/DIY, confirming the post exists. However, the Task Tips specify that when creating a post, all content should be placed in the Body field and the URL field should be left empty. I submitted only the title and left the body empty, so to fully comply with the instructions, I should edit the post and add the provided content to the Body. On the current page, there is an “Edit” link (bid 145). Clicking it should take me to the edit form where I can add the body text and save the changes.
