🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is still on the Dashboard, but it is on the critical path toward the goal since the Catalog menu is expanded. To retrieve SKUs of products with exactly 10 units left, the next necessary view is the Products grid.

  - link 'Products' [201]: Visible and enabled in the expanded Catalog menu (needed to access the products grid).
  - link 'Categories' [204]: Visible and enabled (not required for this task).

The user asked for the SKU of products that have 10 units left. To find this, I should navigate to the Products grid in Magento Admin, where I can filter by stock quantity (Qty) to exactly 10 and then read the SKU column from the filtered results. From the current Dashboard view, the left side Catalog menu is already expanded (from my previous click on CATALOG), showing links for "Products" and "Categories". The correct next step is to click "Products" to open the product listing grid. Once on the Products grid, I'll use filters (likely on the "Qty" column) to set it to 10 (possibly both From and To = 10 if range inputs) and then gather the SKUs from the filtered results. Therefore, I will click the "Products" link with bid 201.

✅ Current Progress: Applied the Quantity filter (from=10, to=10) on the Products grid. The grid updated and currently shows 0 records, so no SKUs have been captured.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the Magento Admin Products grid, which is on the critical path to the goal.
- Active filter: “Quantity: 10 - 10” [907 listitem] with remove button [9951] (visible).
- Status: “0 records found” is displayed; the product table shows only headers (including “SKU” [1771] and “Quantity” [1775]) with no data rows.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - button “Filters” [902]: visible, enabled (for adjusting filters).
  - button “Clear all” [914]: visible, enabled (to remove all filters).
  - textbox “Search by keyword” [1397]: visible, empty.
  - textbox “per page” [1433]: visible, value='200'.
  - pagination buttons [1462], [1465]: disabled; spinbutton “of 1” [1463] value=1.
- Conclusion: With Quantity filtered to exactly 10, no matching products are returned; therefore, no SKUs are available to extract from the current results.

 <think>
The user wants SKUs for products with exactly 10 units left. I'm on the Magento Admin Products grid. The Filters panel has been used to set Quantity From=10 and To=10, which is reflected in the "Active filters: Quantity: 10 - 10". The grid shows "0 records found," meaning no products match this exact quantity. Since no rows are returned, there are no SKUs to extract. The appropriate next step is to inform the user that no products meet the criteria and offer to adjust the search if desired.
