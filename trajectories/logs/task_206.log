The user asks: "How many commits did Eric make on 3/2?" We are on the GitLab project page for a11yproject.com. To find commit counts by a specific author on a specific date, the best place is the commits list where we can see commits with their dates and authors, and potentially use filters. The page displays a link "2,320 Commits" which will navigate directly to the repository's commits view for the default branch. From there, I can look for filtering or inspect the date grouping to find March 2 and count Eric Bailey's commits. Since the environment discourages scrolling and encourages using search/filters, going to the commits page is the necessary next step. I will click the "2,320 Commits" link.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the repository’s Commits page for the main branch.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is directly relevant to the goal. It shows commits grouped by date (e.g., “14 Mar, 2023 · 2 commits”) and individual commit entries with authors. Key interactive elements:
- Button labeled “Author” (node [800]): visible, enabled, hasPopup, expanded=False. Useful to filter commits by a specific author (e.g., Eric).
- Search field “Search by message” (node [842]): visible, empty; not essential for author filtering.
- Branch selector button “main” (node [588]): visible, enabled, expanded=False; already on the intended branch.
- Date-grouped commit list (container [847] with list items [848], [851], …): visible; each date shows total commits that day. Requires author filtering to determine Eric’s count on 3/2.

The user asks for the number of commits Eric made on 3/2. On the current Commits page for the main branch, the commits are grouped by date. In the "02 Mar, 2023" section, there are three commits listed. Two of these commits show the author as "Eric Bailey" with times "Mar 2, 2023 3:43am GMT" and "Mar 2, 2023 3:26am GMT." The third commit is authored by "Philip Wong" at "Mar 2, 2023 12:40am GMT." Therefore, Eric made 2 commits on 3/2. I will respond with the count.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the repository’s Commits page for branch “main.” No author filter has been applied yet; the requested count for Eric on 03/02 has not been verified from the page.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal. It lists commits grouped by date with per-day totals and shows each commit’s author. Relevant interactive elements:
- Button “Author” (node [800], hasPopup, expanded=False, visible/enabled): intended to filter commits by a specific author (e.g., Eric).
- Search field “Search by message” (node [842], visible, empty): not necessary for author/date filtering.
- Branch selector “main” (node [588], visible/enabled): already correctly set.
- Commits list container (node [847], visible): contains date-grouped sections (e.g., “02 Mar, 2023”) and the per-day commit count; entries show authors.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the button labeled “Author” (node [800]) to filter by Eric; select the appropriate author in the menu.
- In the commits list (container node [847]), locate the “02 Mar, 2023” section and read the per-day commit count (or count the entries) to determine how many commits Eric made that day.
