The goal is to create a new public project named "awesome-llms" and then add three members: primer, convexegg, and abishek. I'm currently on the "Projects · Dashboard · GitLab" page. The most direct way to start creating a project is to click the "New project" link/button visible in the main section, which is identified in the accessibility tree as [252] link 'New project'. Clicking this should navigate to the project creation flow where I can choose a template (likely "Create blank project"), set the project name, adjust visibility to Public, and proceed. After the project is created, I'll navigate to Project information > Members and invite the specified users. For now, the next best single action is to initiate project creation by clicking "New project".

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened the “Create blank project” form.
- Set Project name and slug to “awesome-llms”.
- Visibility is set to Public.
- Attempted to change namespace; selected “webagent,” and previously tried to submit, resulting in duplicate-name/path errors.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to achieving the goal (creating the project).
- Blocking errors are visible: [239–245] alert shows “Project namespace name has already been taken,” “Name has already been taken,” and “Path has already been taken.”
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - [274] textbox “Project name” — required, value='awesome-llms', visible.
  - [304] textbox “Project slug” — required, value='awesome-llms', visible.
  - [336] radio “Public” — checked=true.
  - [347] checkbox “Initialize repository with a README” — checked=true.
  - [284] button namespace picker — label='webagent', expanded=false, visible.
  - [358] button “Create project” — visible/enabled.
- Current configuration (namespace='webagent' with name/slug='awesome-llms') is causing conflicts; changing to a different namespace is necessary.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Open the namespace picker and choose a different namespace: click button [284], then select menuitem [1093] “webagent1” (or any other non-conflicting namespace).
- Submit the form again: click button [358] “Create project”.

  - [358] button “Create project” — visible.
- The duplicate errors indicate the current namespace has an existing project with the same name/slug; selecting a different namespace should resolve this while keeping the required name.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- In the open namespace dropdown, select a different namespace: click menuitem [1093] “webagent1” (or another listed group that is not “webagent”).
- Submit the form: click button [358] “Create project”. After successful creation, proceed to add members in the project’s Members settings.

The user’s goal is to add primer, convexegg, and abishek as members to the newly created public project "awesome-llms." I’m on the project's Members page with the "Invite members" modal open. The "Username or email address" field is already filled with "primer, convexegg, abishek" and focused. The role selector is set to Guest, which is acceptable since the user did not specify roles. The dropdown shows "No matches found," but GitLab typically allows proceeding to invite by clicking the Invite button, especially if the usernames exist or if invites are sent via email addresses. The next logical step is to click the "Invite" button to submit the invitations.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the “awesome-llms” project’s Members page.
- Opened the “Invite members” dialog.
- Entered “primer, convexegg, abishek” and attempted to invite, but received an error.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The “Members · webagent / awesome-llms · GitLab” page is on the critical path for adding members.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - [604] button “Invite members” — visible and enabled; modal is open.
  - Invite modal:
    - Input field labeled “Username or email address” — visible; currently filled with “primer, convexegg, abishek”; shows error banner “Please add members to invite,” indicating no valid selections have been added.
    - Role selector “Select a role” — visible and enabled (currently “Guest”).
    - Button “Invite” — visible and enabled.
    - Button “Cancel” — visible and enabled.
- The error suggests the usernames were typed but not selected from suggestions (no members recognized), so invitations could not be submitted.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- In the Invite members modal, use the “Username or email address” input to add members one at a time: type “primer”, select the matching suggestion to add it, then repeat for “convexegg” and “abishek”.
- Click the “Invite” button to submit the invitations once all three users are selected.

The goal is to add three users (primer, convexegg, abishek) to the "awesome-llms" project. I’m on the Members page with the “Invite members” modal open. The “Username or email address” field currently contains the comma-separated string “primer, convexegg, abishek,” but there’s an alert saying “Please add members to invite,” and the Invite button is disabled. This indicates the field expects selecting recognized users (tokens) from suggestions rather than raw text. The best approach is to add members one by one by typing a username to trigger suggestions and select it. First, I will adjust the field to contain just “primer” to prompt suggestions for that user, which I can then select in subsequent steps.

 <think>
The user’s goal is to add primer, convexegg, and abishek as members to the “awesome-llms” project. I’m on the project’s Members page with the “Invite members” modal open. Tokens for Primer and Convex Eggtart have already been added. The input textbox (bid 917) currently contains “abishek,” and the suggestions menu shows “Abishek S abisubramanya27” (bid 1436). I previously attempted to click the suggestion, but it timed out—likely due to the element not being considered visible/stable for the click. A reliable alternative is to select the suggestion via the keyboard by pressing Enter while the input has focus, which typically accepts the top suggestion and converts it into a token. After this, the Invite button should become enabled, allowing me to submit the invitations in the next step.

```press("917", "Enter")```
