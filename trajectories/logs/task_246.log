🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to the goal. The grid lists 351 records and includes columns for ID, Created, Status, Title, Nickname, Review, Visibility, Type, Product, SKU, and Action.
- Key interactive elements:
  - “Search” button [700] — visible and enabled.
  - “Reset Filter” button [703] — visible and enabled.
  - Filter row under the table headers (row [793]) — includes per-column inputs; use the textbox under the “Product” column to filter for “Chloe”.
  - Action column “Edit” links (visible on each row) — clickable to open full review details (needed to verify rating/score).
  - Pagination controls: per-page selector [749] and page input [759] — visible and enabled.
- Relevant visible rows for the target product:
  - Product: “Chloe Compete Tank (WT06)” — Nickname: Emerald — Title: “Could be flirtier.”
  - Product: “Chloe Compete Tank (WT06)” — Nickname: Concepcion — Title: “Makes me feel so snug! WHOOO!”
  - Product: “Chloe Compete Tank (WT06)” — Nickname: Teofila — Title: “Watch out! Not for non-petite”
- The grid currently appears unfiltered; to determine “most unhappy,” the lowest rating among Chloe Compete Tank reviews should be identified (rating is not shown in the grid and likely requires opening the review via the “Edit” link).

The goal is to identify the customer most unhappy with the Chloe tank, i.e., the reviewer with the lowest rating among reviews for "Chloe Compete Tank." I’m currently on the Edit Review page for one review (Nickname: Teofila). To compare ratings across the other Chloe Compete Tank reviews (e.g., Emerald and Concepcion), I need to navigate to other review records. Instead of going back to the grid, the page provides a "Previous" button that navigates between reviews, which is faster and avoids the earlier timeout when trying to click a grid link while not on the grid. I will click the "Previous" button to move to the next review record and check its rating, repeating as necessary to find the lowest.

Task: Identify the customer (reviewer nickname) who is most unhappy with the "Chloe tank" by finding the lowest-rated review for the product "Chloe Compete Tank."

Current page: Edit Review for Chloe Compete Tank with nickname "Emerald" (ID 334). The Summary Rating visually appears around 4 stars.
