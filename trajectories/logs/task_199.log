The user wants the order ID of the newest pending order. From the Dashboard, the most direct path is to navigate to Sales > Orders, then filter by status "Pending" and sort by Purchase Date in descending order (as per the important tip that we must perform sorting explicitly). 

Currently, we're on the Dashboard page. The left sidebar shows a vertical navigation with "SALES". To reach the Orders grid, the next appropriate step is to click the "SALES" menu, which should expand to reveal subsections like Orders, Invoices, etc. After that, we'll click "Orders", then apply the necessary filter and sorting.

So the immediate next single action is to click the "SALES" link in the sidebar to open its submenu.

- link 'Orders' (axtree id: 168) — visible and clickable within the expanded Sales menu.
Other menu items (e.g., 'Invoices' [171], 'Shipments' [174]) are also visible but not relevant to retrieving pending orders. The Orders grid (where filtering by Pending and sorting by date would occur) has not been reached yet.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the Sales > Orders grid. The orders table is visible with 142 records. Sorting is currently on “Purchase Date” (ascending). A filter is applied for Status = Canceled.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to retrieve the newest pending order, but the current filter (Status: Canceled) is misaligned with the goal. Relevant elements:
- Active filter chip: “Status: Canceled” with remove button [854] (visible, clickable).
- Button “Clear all” [857] (visible, enabled) — removes all active filters.
- Button “Filters” [845] (visible, enabled) — opens filter panel to set Status to “Pending”.
- Column header “↑ Purchase Date” [1390] (visible, clickable) — currently sorted ascending; clicking toggles to descending to show newest first.
- Orders table with ID column present (e.g., first visible row shows ID “000000136” [1414]).

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button “Clear all” [857] to remove the Canceled filter.
- Click button “Filters” [845] to open the filters panel and set Status to “Pending” (then apply). After filtering, click the “Purchase Date” column header [1390] to sort descending so the newest pending order appears first.

The goal is to find the order ID of the newest pending order. I’m on the Orders grid page, but I see an active filter showing “Status: Canceled,” which prevents seeing pending orders. I need to remove this filter and then set Status to Pending. After filtering, I must sort by Purchase Date in descending order (as required by the task tips for recent orders). The UI shows:

- A Filters button [845] to open the filter panel.
- The Purchase Date column header [1390] currently shows an up arrow (ascending).
First, I’ll clear the existing “Canceled” filter to avoid conflicts. Then I’ll set Status to Pending and apply, and finally sort Purchase Date descending. Since I can only do one action now, I will click “Clear all” [857] to remove the current filter.

Goal: Find the order ID of the newest pending order.

Current page: Sales > Orders grid is open. The Filters panel is visible with various filter fields, including a Status combobox (bid 972) showing options such as Pending (option 982). The table is massive; manually scanning is inefficient. The correct approach is to filter to Status = Pending, then ensure the grid is sorted by Purchase Date in descending order (newest first). I already clicked the Purchase Date header earlier to sort (as required), and the Filters panel is open. Next, I need to set the Status filter to Pending.

Because the Status element is a custom combobox (not a native select), I should first click the combobox to expand it, and then select the "Pending" option in a subsequent action. Applying filters will come after selecting the status. Therefore, the next single action is to click the Status combobox (bid 972) to expand it and reveal its options.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The Orders grid page is on the critical path to obtain the newest pending order ID.
- Relevant interactive elements (from the Filters panel):
  - Status filter combobox [972] — expanded=True; current selection is empty [973] (selected=True); option “Pending” [982] is visible and not selected.
  - Filters toggle button [845] — visible; panel is open.
  - Other filters present and empty: ID [957], Bill-to Name [962], Ship-to Name [967].
  - Purchase Point combobox [948] — value “All Store Views” (selected).
  - Search by keyword textbox [840] and “Search” button [841] — visible; not directly needed for status filtering.
- After selecting “Pending” and applying the filter, the first row (with newest-first sort) will contain the target order ID.

The user wants the order ID of the newest pending order. I'm on the Sales > Orders grid page. I have already sorted by Purchase Date (descending) and opened the Filters panel, expanding the Status combobox. When I tried to click the "Pending" option (bid 982), it failed due to the element not being visible and the environment not supporting scrolling. To reliably select "Pending" without needing to scroll, I should use the select_option action on the Status combobox, which often maps to an underlying <select> element in Magento’s UI. After successfully selecting "Pending", I will apply filters in a subsequent step to view the pending orders sorted by newest first.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Sales > Orders grid.
- Cleared existing filters.
- Clicked “Purchase Date” column to sort newest-first.
- Opened Filters and set Status to “Pending” via combobox [972].

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The Orders grid is the correct place to obtain the newest pending order ID; we are on the critical path.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Status filter combobox [972] — value set to “Pending” (selected; combobox visible).
  - Filters toggle button [845] — visible; filter panel is open.
  - “Search” button [841] — visible; this applies the selected filters to the grid.
  - Search by keyword textbox [840] — visible; empty (not needed for this task).
  - Other filter fields — ID [957], Bill-to Name [962], Ship-to Name [967] — visible; empty.
  - Purchase Point combobox [948] — value “All Store Views” (selected; visible).
- Next key action to progress: apply the pending-status filter using the “Search” button [841], then read the first row’s value in the ID column (newest-first due to prior sort) to obtain the target order ID.

The goal is to obtain the order ID of the newest pending order. I am on the Sales > Orders grid page. I already enforced the required descending sort on the "Purchase Date" column and set the Status filter to "Pending" via the Status combobox. However, the grid still shows all records (308 records) and includes various statuses, which indicates that the selected filter hasn't been applied yet. The Filters panel shows an "Apply Filters" button [1065] that needs to be clicked to apply the "Pending" filter. After applying, I will read the first row’s ID (newest due to descending sort). Therefore, the next step is to click "Apply Filters".

The user asked for the order ID of the newest pending order. I'm on the Orders grid under Sales with an active filter "Status: Pending" and the grid shows "10 records found." The "Purchase Date" column header shows a down arrow (↓), implying descending order, but the listed dates appear to run from April 19, 2023 through May 31, 2023, suggesting the newest (May 31) is currently at the bottom. To comply with the rule that when querying recent orders I must sort by Purchase Date descending, I need to ensure the grid is actually sorted correctly so the newest pending order appears at the top. The best next step is to click the "Purchase Date" column header to toggle and enforce the correct descending sort, after which I can read the top row’s ID and report it to the user.

- Results reduced to 10 records; on page 1 of 1.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- We are on the correct Orders grid page for the goal.
- Relevant elements:
  - Active filter chip “Status: Pending” [850] — visible; confirms filter applied.
  - “↑ Purchase Date” column header [1390] — visible; currently sorted ascending (oldest first), which is not suitable for finding the newest order.
  - Records count “10 records found” — visible; small result set.
  - First row ID cell shows “000000299” [1414] — indicates oldest is at top due to ascending sort.
- To get the newest pending order, the grid must be sorted by Purchase Date in descending order.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click column header “Purchase Date” [1390] to toggle to descending (newest first).
- After sorting, read the ID from the first row’s ID cell (the top row in the grid).
