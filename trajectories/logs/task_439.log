- Sidebar link “My Orders” (visible, enabled) — used to access full order history beyond the recent list.
- “Recent Orders” table (visible) — shows multiple orders dated in 2025 with “View Order” and “Reorder” links (visible, enabled) in the Action column. These entries are not from 2022 and thus are not the target.
- Other account links (e.g., “Address Book”, “Edit Address”) are visible but not relevant to the goal.
The search box/button in the header shows the “Search” button disabled and is not useful for order history navigation.

The user wants me to reorder a cat t-shirt that was ordered in 2022 and later cancelled. To accomplish this, I need to navigate to the full order history and locate orders from 2022, identify the cancelled order that contains the cat t-shirt, and then use a “Reorder” action if available on that order’s detail page.

I am currently on the “My Account” page. The “Recent Orders” table only shows 2025 orders and is not helpful for 2022 history. The left sidebar contains a “My Orders” link (bid 1541), which is the correct entry point to access the full list of orders, where I can look for 2022 entries and filter or search if such controls exist. Therefore, the next logical step is to click “My Orders.”

The user wants me to reorder a cat t-shirt they purchased in 2022 and later canceled. I’m on the My Orders page, which shows only recent 2025 orders and has pagination indicating 48 total orders. To find the 2022 canceled order, I should navigate to the oldest orders. The pagination control shows links for Page 2–5.

- Verified the items in this order; none are a cat t-shirt. No reorder executed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is an order detail view related to the goal, but this is not the correct order to reorder (its items include “Makeup Brush 10 Pcs…”, “Nail Dryer Lamp…”, and “The Body Shop Camomile Makeup Removing Kit”).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link “Reorder” [1363] — visible/enabled. Using it would add the wrong items to cart.
  - Link “Print Order” [1365] — visible/enabled (not needed for the goal).
  - Top navigation link “My Account” [220] — visible/enabled; can return to account area to access the orders list.
- Conclusion: Off-track for the target item; need to return to the orders list and locate the canceled 2022 order that contains the cat t-shirt.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link “My Account” [220] to return to the account dashboard, then navigate to Orders to review other canceled 2022 orders and locate the one with the cat t-shirt.

Goal: Reorder a cat t-shirt from a 2022 order that was later cancelled. Current page is the detail view for Order #000000182 (Canceled, June 30, 2022).

The user wants me to reorder a cat t-shirt that was ordered in 2022 and later canceled. I’m on the My Orders page, already on Page 5 (Items 41–48 of 48), which shows 2022 orders. Among the visible entries, there are several with Status “Canceled,” including Order #000000182 (already checked and not the t-shirt), Order #000000173 (3/10/22), and Order #000000160 (3/2/22). To identify which canceled order contains the cat t-shirt, I should open the next canceled order’s details. The row for Order #000000173 has a “View Order” link with bid 1434. Clicking that will let me inspect the items to confirm if it includes the cat t-shirt, and then I can use its “Reorder” option if it’s the right one.

✅ Current Progress:

- Reviewed the items listed on this order; no cat t-shirt identified yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path: it’s an individual canceled order detail view from 2022.
- Relevant interactive elements (visible/enabled):
  - link 'Reorder' [1363] — would add all items from this order to cart.
  - link 'Print Order' [1365] — not relevant to the goal.
  - table 'Items Ordered' [1374] — shows items like “SIKA 173105 Optimax Sandal ...” and other non–t-shirt apparel; no “cat t-shirt” appears in the visible rows.
- Using the 'Reorder' link on this order would not satisfy the goal since the order does not show a cat t-shirt. The correct path is to return to the orders list and open other canceled 2022 orders to locate the one containing the cat t-shirt before reordering.

The user wants me to reorder a cat t-shirt that was ordered in 2022 and later canceled. I’m currently viewing Order #000000173 (Canceled on March 10, 2022).

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to My Orders and paginated to the oldest orders (2022).
- Reviewed three canceled 2022 orders: #000000182 (6/30/22), #000000173 (3/10/22), and #000000160 (3/2/22); none contained a cat t-shirt.
- Returned to the My Orders list (oldest page) to continue searching.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page “My Orders” is on the critical path to the goal. It shows 2022 orders with per-row actions.
- Relevant interactive elements in the Orders table:
  - Order #000000182 (6/30/22, Status: Canceled): “View Order” link [1390], “Reorder” link [1392] — visible/clickable.
  - Order #000000167 (7/8/22, Status: Complete): “View Order” link [1379], “Reorder” link [1381] — visible/clickable.
  - Order #000000181 (5/22/22, Status: Complete): “View Order” link [1401], “Reorder” link [1403] — visible/clickable.
- Pagination to oldest orders is active (Page “5” link previously used [1506]); this is the correct area to locate the canceled 2022 order that includes the cat t-shirt.
- Next step on-track: open remaining 2022 canceled orders via their “View Order” links to confirm the cat t-shirt before using the corresponding “Reorder” link.

The user wants me to reorder a cat t-shirt from a 2022 order that was later canceled. On Page 5 of My Orders, I checked all canceled orders listed (000000182, 000000173, 000000160) and none contained a cat t-shirt. Therefore, the relevant canceled order might be from later in 2022, which should appear on the next earlier page of orders (Page 4). The pagination controls show a "Page 4" link (bid 1484).

Goal: Reorder a cat t-shirt from a 2022 order that was later canceled. I’m on My Orders, page 4 (Items 31–40 of 48), which shows several 2022 orders including multiple with Status “Canceled.” To identify the correct order containing the cat t-shirt, I should open the details of canceled orders and check the item list before using Reorder.

Visible canceled orders on this page:
- #000000177 (10/18/22) — Canceled — View Order [1401], Reorder [1403]
- #000000172 (8/12/22) — Canceled — View Order [1445], Reorder [1447]
- #000000149 (7/25/22) — Canceled — View Order [1478], Reorder [1480]

The best next step is to start with the most recent canceled order on this page (#000000177, 10/18/22) by clicking its “View Order” link (bid 1401) to inspect the items and see if it includes a cat t-shirt. If not, I will return and check the other canceled orders (172, 149).

The user asked me to reorder a cat t-shirt from a canceled 2022 order. I navigated through My Orders, found Order #000000172 (Canceled, August 12, 2022), which includes “I Love My Tuxedo Cat T-Shirt (Men, Large)” and initiated Reorder. I’m now on the Shopping Cart page. The cart currently has 3 items: 
- POPYOUNG Women’s Tunic Top
- Get Well Gift Care Package
- I Love My Tuxedo Cat T-Shirt (Men, Large)

Since the user only requested the cat t-shirt, I should remove the other two items before proceeding to checkout. The top item (POPYOUNG women’s tunic) has a “Remove item” link with bid 2056. The logical next step is to click that to clean up the cart, then I’ll remove the gift package next and proceed to checkout with only the t-shirt.

- “Get Well - Feel Better Soon Gift Care Package” (not needed)
- “I Love My Tuxedo Cat T-Shirt (Men, Large)” (the item we want)

To fulfill the user’s request, I should remove the non-tshirt item so the cart contains only the cat t-shirt. In the accessibility tree, the “Remove item” link for the gift package is bid 2014. I will click that to remove the gift package, leaving only the t-shirt in the cart. After that, I can proceed to checkout in a subsequent step.
