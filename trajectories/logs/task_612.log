The user wants to create a new post (submission) in the forum corresponding to r/books with the title/content from their request. The site is Postmill and there's a visible "Submit" link in the top navigation (bid 62). According to the task tips, when creating a post we should put all content in the Body field and leave URL empty, and choose the most relevant forum, which is "books". To begin, I need to open the submission form by clicking "Submit". This will likely present fields for Title, URL, Body, and Forum selection. Then I'll fill the Title as "big little lies" (matching case), Body as "can't stop it", leave URL empty, and select the "books" forum. The first step is to click the "Submit" link to access the form.

The task is to post a review in the forum equivalent to r/books. We're on the "Create submission" page with fields: Title (required), Body, URL (radio selected but we will leave the URL textbox empty per tips), Forum combobox, and a Create submission button. To proceed, we need to fill in the Title and Body with the exact text provided, then select the correct forum (books), and submit.

According to the task tips, all content should be placed in the Body field and the URL field left empty. The Title is required; a logical title is the book name "big little lies". The next step should be to fill the Title field. The Title textbox is identified as [137] in the accessibility tree and matches the screenshot tag [137]. I will fill it with "big little lies". After that, I will fill the Body with "can't stop it", select the forum 'books', and submit.

I will start by filling the Title field.

The Title field is already filled as "big little lies" and the Body contains "can't stop it", matching the exact text required. The URL field is empty, which adheres to the instruction to leave it empty. The remaining required step is to choose the forum. The "Forum *" section shows a combobox labeled "Choose one…" (bid 378) with an embedded textbox (bid 379). To select the correct forum, I should first expand the combobox to reveal available options.
