The user wants me to dislike (downvote) all submissions by Hrekires in the news forum. I’m on /f/news and have already downvoted several Hrekires posts; the accessibility tree confirms those now show “−1” and “Retract downvote.” Scanning remaining Hrekires submissions, I see three that are still upvoted and need downvotes:
- “Crypto giant FTX to file for bankruptcy…” shows “Retract upvote” with a “Downvote” button [448].
- “SEC, DOJ Investigating Crypto Platform FTX” shows “Retract upvote” with “Downvote” [486].
- “Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly wins re-election…” shows “Retract upvote” with “Downvote” [524].

To proceed methodically from top to bottom, the next action is to click the “Downvote” button [448] on the “Crypto giant FTX…” submission to mark it as disliked.

The goal is to downvote all submissions by Hrekires in the news forum. On the current /f/news page, most Hrekires posts now show “Retract downvote” with a vote count of −1, indicating they are already disliked. However, the post “SEC, DOJ Investigating Crypto Platform FTX” (Submitted by Hrekires) still shows “Retract upvote” and a “Downvote” button [486], meaning it remains upvoted. To progress toward the goal, I should click the “Downvote” button for this submission. After this, I will proceed to downvote the remaining Hrekires post that is still upvoted (“Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly wins re-election” with downvote [524]) and then use “More” to handle older submissions if necessary.
