We are on the "Create from template" page, and the Template shows "Android," confirming the correct template is selected. The "Project name" and "Project slug" are already set to "web_agent_android_xs." The remaining step before creating the project is to change the visibility to Private. My previous attempt to click the Private radio input [770] timed out because the associated label [771] intercepted pointer events. To successfully set the visibility, I should click the label [771] for "Private," which will toggle the radio to the desired state. After that, I can proceed to click "Create project," but since only one action is allowed at a time, I will first set the visibility by clicking the label.
