The user wants to invite two collaborators to the gimmiethat.space repo. I am on the Project members page with the “Invite members” modal open. The “Username or email address” field is already filled with “Jakub Klinkovský,” and an autocomplete suggestion appears: “Jakub Klinkovský lahwaacz.” To add Jakub properly, I should click the suggestion so he becomes a selected token in the input. After that, I can add the second collaborator (Benoît Blanchon), set an appropriate role (likely Developer for collaborators), and then click Invite. The immediate next step is to select Jakub from the suggestion list.

The user wants to invite two collaborators to the "gimmiethat.space" GitLab project. I’m already on the Project members page with the “Invite members” modal open.

The “Username or email address” textbox (bid 929) is the field to add more users, and the next collaborator to add is “Benoît Blanchon.” The modal also has the role combobox currently defaulting to “Guest,” which I’ll adjust to “Developer” after adding both names.

The goal is to invite Jakub Klinkovský and Benoît Blanchon as collaborators to the gimmiethat.space repository. I am on the Project members page with the "Invite members" modal open. Both users are already added as tokens in the "Username or email address" field, confirming they are selected to be invited. The role selector (combobox) is currently set to "Guest," which is insufficient for collaborator privileges. Typically, "Developer" corresponds to collaborator-level access (ability to push code and manage issues). Therefore, the next step is to change the role from "Guest" to "Developer" using the role combobox. After setting the correct role, I will proceed to invite them, but since only one action is allowed per step, I will first select "Developer" in the role combobox.
