The user wants to add a white desk to their wish list. I need to navigate to a product page for a white desk and use the “Add to Wish List” link on that product. From the homepage, the most relevant top menu category is “Office Products,” which likely contains office furniture and desks. The menu items have popup submenus, so the correct approach is to hover over “Office Products” to reveal its subcategories, then proceed to desks and locate a white desk. Therefore, the next best step is to hover on the "Office Products" menu item to open its submenu.

✅ Current Progress: Hovered “Office Products” (id: 722) to open its submenu; subcategories are now exposed.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the One Stop Market homepage, which is on the critical path since category navigation and search are available for finding a white desk.
- Relevant navigation elements under “Office Products”:
  - Menuitem “Office Electronics” (id: 727), hasPopup='menu', visible.
  - Menuitem “Office & School Supplies” (id: 735), hasPopup='menu', visible.
  - Menuitem “Office Furniture & Lighting” (id: 743), hasPopup='menu', visible. This is the most relevant path toward desks.
- Search controls:
  - Combobox labeled “Search” (id: 273), autocomplete='both', hasPopup='listbox', expanded=False; editable.
  - “Search” button (id: 278) is currently disabled (will typically enable after entering a query).
- Wish list status:
  - Top-link “My Wish List 7 items” (id: 229), visible; useful for verification after adding an item.
- Product grid shows various items with “Add to Wish List” links (e.g., id: 1410), but current showcase items are not desks, so not directly relevant to the goal from this page.

Given the site tips to use dropdown navigation, the next logical step is to hover “Office Furniture & Lighting” to reveal its deeper submenu (e.g., desks), and then I can select the desks category and find a white desk to add to the wish list.

The goal is to add a white desk to the wish list. I previously hovered over “Office Products” and “Office Furniture & Lighting,” which revealed subcategories like “Chairs & Sofas” and “Cabinets, Racks & Shelves,” but there is no visible “Desks” option in the submenu.
