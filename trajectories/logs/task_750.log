The user wants to create a new private project named "agi_index" using an HTML template and then add "Vinta Chen" as a member. I'm currently on the GitLab dashboard Projects page, and I see a "New project" link/button (element [252]) near the top under the "Projects" heading. The first step should be to initiate project creation by clicking "New project." After that, I will select "Create from template" and find the HTML template, set the project name to "agi_index," and ensure visibility is set to Private. Then, once the project is created, I will navigate to Project information > Members and invite "Vinta Chen." For now, the next best single action is to click "New project" to start the flow.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the “Create new project” page in GitLab with options to start a project. No project has been created yet; template not selected; members not added.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal. Key interactive elements:
- link “Create from template” (id [248]) — visible and clickable; relevant for selecting an HTML template.
- link “Create blank project” (id [241]) — visible and clickable; not aligned with using a template.
- link “Import project” (id [255]) — visible and clickable; not needed for this task.
- link “Show command” (id [263]) — optional/irrelevant for the GUI flow.
Note: The last action clicked the heading inside the “Create from template” card (id [252]), which did not advance the flow.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the link labeled “Create from template” (id [248]) to proceed to template selection for an HTML starter.

The goal is to create a new private project named "agi_index" using an HTML template and then add Vinta Chen as a member. I'm on the "Create new project" page with three options: "Create blank project," "Create from template," and "Import project." To use an HTML template, I should select "Create from template." The previous click targeted the heading inside the card, which didn’t navigate. The correct interactive link is labeled "Create from template" with element [248]. Clicking this should take me to the template selection flow where I can choose an HTML template, then set the project name and visibility. After creating the project, I’ll proceed to add members. For now, the next step is to click the "Create from template" link.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to creating a project from an HTML template. Relevant interactive elements:
- “Pages/Plain HTML” template row:
  - link “Preview” (marker [528]) — visible.
  - “Use template” control/button (marker [532]) — visible, currently not selected.
- Other template rows show similar “Use template” controls (e.g., Ruby on Rails [387], Spring [399], NodeJS Express [411]), all unchecked; these are not aligned with the HTML requirement.
Breadcrumb shows “New project > Create from template,” confirming correct flow. Visibility and member settings will appear after selecting a template.

The user’s goal is to create a private project named "agi_index" using an HTML template and then add Vinta Chen as a member. I’m currently on the “Create from template” page, listing built-in templates. I need to pick an HTML template. There are two relevant entries: “Pages/Plain HTML” and “Netlify/Plain HTML.” The straightforward choice matching “HTML template” is “Pages/Plain HTML.” 

In the accessibility tree, the “Pages/Plain HTML” row shows:
- [525] strong 'Pages/Plain HTML'
- [529] link 'Preview'
- [531] radio 'Use template'

The next step is to select the “Use template” radio for the "Pages/Plain HTML" row, which should take me to the project configuration form where I can set the project name to "agi_index" and adjust visibility to Private. After that, I will proceed to the members section to add Vinta Chen.

So the immediate action is to click the "Use template" radio ([531]) for "Pages/Plain HTML".

The goal is to create a private project named "agi_index" from an HTML template and then add Vinta Chen as a member. I’m on the “Create from template” page, and I previously attempted to click the radio control for “Pages/Plain HTML” (bid 531), but the click timed out because a span (bid 532) intercepted the pointer events. This indicates the label/span is the interactive target to select the template rather than the radio itself. The Accessibility Tree shows LabelText [530] with a child span [532] “Use template” adjacent to the “Pages/Plain HTML” entry. To proceed, I should click the span [532], which should select the template and move on to the project configuration form where I can set the project name and visibility. I will avoid repeating the same action that failed and instead click the intercepting span directly.

The task is to create a private project named agi_index from the Pages/Plain HTML template and then add Vinta Chen as a member. I’m currently on the “Create from template” form with Project name and slug already set to agi_index. The visibility is still set to Public (radio [820] checked). I previously tried clicking the Private radio [804], but the click failed because its associated label [805] intercepted pointer events. In such cases, clicking the label is the correct approach since labels toggle the associated radio input. Therefore, the next step is to click the "Private" label [805] to change the visibility to Private. Once Private is selected, I can proceed to click "Create project" and then add members.

✅ Current Progress:
- Selected the “Pages/Plain HTML” template previously and filled project name/slug as “agi_index”; visibility was set to Private.
- Attempted to create the project, but submission failed with validation errors (project not created yet).
- Member addition for “Vinta Chen” has not started.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Current page is “Create from template” and is on the critical path to the goal, but the last action resulted in errors.
- An error alert is shown:
  - “Project namespace name has already been taken”
  - “Name has already been taken”
  - “Path has already been taken”
- Relevant interactive elements on this page:
  - Template list with “Use template” controls:
    - “Pages/Plain HTML”: “Use template” radio [531] and its label [532] (visible; selectable).
    - “Preview” link [529] (visible).
  - Breadcrumb links: “New project” [256], “Create from template” [261] (visible).
- The presence of these errors indicates the project creation did not succeed, likely due to a duplicate name/slug in the selected namespace. You are back on the template selection screen; the project configuration form is not currently visible.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the “Use template” control for “Pages/Plain HTML” (radio [531] or label [532]) to return to the project configuration form, then adjust the namespace or slug to avoid duplicates before re-submitting.

The user wants a private project named "agi_index" set up using an HTML template and to add "Vinta Chen" as a member. I tried creating the project from the Pages/Plain HTML template, set the name/slug to "agi_index," set visibility to Private, and clicked Create project. The page now shows an error alert: "Project namespace name has already been taken," "Name has already been taken," and "Path has already been taken." This indicates a project named "agi_index" already exists in the current namespace, so creating a new one with the same name isn’t possible.

Given the goal is to “Start a private project agi_index with HTML template and add Vinta Chen as members,” and since the name is already taken, the pragmatic path is to locate the existing "agi_index" project and proceed to add Vinta Chen as a member rather than trying to create a duplicate with a modified slug. The Task Tips advise not to use the global search bar and instead use the specific search URL. Therefore, the best next step is to navigate directly to the GitLab search URL for "agi_index" to locate the existing project quickly. Once found, I can navigate into it and use Project information > Members to invite Vinta Chen.

Thus, I will use the goto action to open the search results for "agi_index".

The objective is to add Vinta Chen as a member to the existing agi_index project, which is already confirmed to be private and created from an HTML template. I previously clicked “Project information” in the sidebar to reach the members management area, but the updated accessibility tree isn’t shown, and relying on specific element IDs could be error-prone if the sub-navigation isn’t visible. To efficiently reach the members management page without needing to scroll or guess element IDs, I’ll navigate directly to the project members URL. In GitLab, the members page is typically at /-/project_members for a given project path. The current project path is /byteblaze/agi_index, so the members page should be at /byteblaze/agi_index/-/project_members. From there, I can use the Invite members button to add Vinta Chen.
