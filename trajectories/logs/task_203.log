The user needs the purchase date and order ID of the most recent pending order. On Magento Admin, this information is typically found in Sales > Orders. From the Dashboard, I see the left navigation with a "SALES" menu item (bid 156). The best next step is to click SALES to access or expand its submenu so I can navigate to Orders. Once in Orders, I will filter by status "Pending" and sort by Purchase Date descending (as required by the task tips) to identify the most recent pending order and read its order ID and purchase date.

The user wants the purchase date and order ID of the most recent pending order. I am on the Sales > Orders grid, and the Active filters already show “Status: Pending,” so the dataset is correct. Benchmark rule 11 requires sorting by Purchase Date in descending order at least once and retrieving the most recent orders accordingly. The column header currently shows “↓ Purchase Date,” but the visible data appears to be in ascending order (older April 19 entries appear before later May 28/31 entries). To ensure the list is correctly sorted with the most recent at the top, I should click the "Purchase Date" column header again to toggle the sort order. After toggling, I will read the first row for the most recent pending order and report its ID and purchase date.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Sales > Orders grid in Magento Admin.
- Applied Status filter = Pending (Active filters show “Status: Pending”).
- All 10 results are visible on one page (per page set to 200).
- Sorting by Purchase Date is currently ascending, so the “most recent” item is not at the top yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant elements:
  - Column header “↑ Purchase Date” [1390]: visible, enabled; indicates ascending sort (needs to be descending to surface the most recent order first).
  - Orders table [1368] → first data row [1409]:
    - ID cell [1414]: visible; current top row shows “000000299” (note: not necessarily the most recent due to ascending sort).
  - “records found” shows 10; pagination “of 1” and per page [1099]=200 ensure all pending results are on this page.
  - Active filter chip “Status: Pending” [7005] confirms correct filtering.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the “Purchase Date” column header [1390] to change sorting to descending (header should show a down arrow).
- After descending sort is active, read the first data row [1409]: capture the ID from cell [1414] and the Purchase Date from the same row under the “Purchase Date” column.

The task is to get the purchase date and order ID of the most recent pending order. I am already on the Sales > Orders grid, and the Active Filters show Status: Pending, so only pending orders are listed. According to the benchmark rule, I must ensure sorting by Purchase Date in descending order to get the most recent order at the top. The action history shows I clicked the Purchase Date column header to sort; the table currently displays the newest date (May 31, 2023) at the top, followed by May 28, 2023, then April 19, 2023 entries, indicating the list is effectively sorted with the most recent first. 

Now I need to read the first row’s ID and Purchase Date. The top row shows:
- ID: 000000299
- Purchase Date: May 31, 2023 2:55:09 AM
- Status: Pending

I will now report these details to the user.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Sales > Orders grid.
- Applied Status filter = Pending (Active filters show “Status: Pending”).
- All results are on one page (per page = 200; pagination indicates 1 page).
- Attempted to sort by “Purchase Date,” but an answer was sent to the user before confirming correct (descending) sort.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant elements:
  - Column header “↑ Purchase Date” [1390]: visible, enabled; currently shows ascending sort (↑), which does not surface the most recent order first.
  - Orders table [1368] → first data row [1409]; ID cell [1414] shows “000000299”.
  - Active filter chip “Status: Pending” [7005]: visible, confirming correct filter.
  - Per-page textbox [1099] = 200; pagination “of 1” [1129]; prev/next buttons [1128], [1131] disabled (all results visible).
- Issue: With ascending sort active, the first row may not be the most recent pending order, so the previously reported result may be incorrect.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the “Purchase Date” column header [1390] to switch to descending order (down arrow).
- After descending sort is active, read the first data row [1409]: get the ID from cell [1414] and the “Purchase Date” cell in the same row, then report those values.
