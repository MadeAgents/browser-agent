The user wants to know the refund amount expected from their order canceled in March 2022, excluding shipping and keeping only the AC-DC Adapter. To calculate this, I need to access their order history to find the canceled order from 2022/03, review the items, totals, shipping fee, and identify the AC-DC Adapter price. The site tips indicate the correct path is My Account > My Orders. On the current homepage, I can see a "My Account" link identified as [227].

The user needs the refund amount for an order canceled in March 2022 while keeping the AC-DC Adapter, and shipping is non-refundable. To compute this, I must:
1) Open the full order history (My Orders).
2) Locate the canceled order from 2022/03.
3) Open its details to see line items, prices, shipping fee, and totals.
4) Calculate the refundable amount = total paid for all items except the AC-DC Adapter, and exclude the shipping fee (and potentially taxes associated with the kept item, depending on how the order details present totals—I'll follow the amounts shown on the order summary).

Currently on the My Account dashboard, I see a left navigation link "My Orders" (bid 1614), which should list all orders including 2022. That is the most direct path versus the "Recent Orders" which only shows 2023. I will click "My Orders" to access the full list and then find March 2022.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to determine the refund because it lists all orders with their dates, statuses, and “View Order” actions.
- table 'Orders' [1474] — visible; columns: 'Order #', 'Date', 'Order Total', 'Status', 'Action'.
- Row example: order '000000170' with date '5/17/23' and status 'Canceled' shows action links:
  - link 'View Order' [1491] — visible/enabled.
  - link 'Reorder' [1493] — visible/enabled.
- Additional rows also provide 'View Order' links [1502], [1513], etc.
- Goal relevance: Need to locate an order dated 2022/03 (March 2022). Current visible rows are 2023; older orders likely require navigating the orders list (e.g., via pagination) and then opening the March 2022 canceled order’s details to read line-item prices (notably the AC-DC Adapter) and totals to compute the refund excluding shipping.

To compute this, I need to locate the specific canceled order from March 2022 in the order history and open its details to see line items, prices, and totals.

Several item lines and prices are visible, but the AC-DC Adapter line (needed to compute refund) has not yet been located.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to the goal.

    - “SIKA 173105 Optimax Sandal …” [1497] — Price $101.90 (visible).
    - “Interspirit Blue Flowers in Stripe 2 Pieces Shirt & Pants Pajamas Set …” — Price $43.59 (visible).
    - “Women’s Round Neck Pullover Sweater … Hoodie Top” — Price $15.11 (visible).
    - “Flamingo Vanilla Decaf Sugar‑Free Chai, 11.9oz” — Price $25.99 (visible).
  - Totals (static, visible):
    - “Subtotal” — $186.59.
    - “Shipping & Handling” — $20.00.
    - “Grand Total” — $206.59.
- The AC-DC Adapter line item is not currently visible in the Items Ordered table. To compute the expected refund (Subtotal minus the AC-DC Adapter price; exclude Shipping & Handling as non-refundable), the adapter’s unit price must be located. If the adapter is not part of this order, the other March 2022 canceled order (Order #000000160) should be checked.

The user wants to know the refund amount for their order(s) canceled in March 2022, noting they kept only the AC-DC Adapter and shipping is non-refundable. I need to review all canceled orders in March 2022 and compute the refundable total: sum of all item charges returned minus the AC-DC Adapter price(s) and excluding shipping.

I’m currently on Order #000000173 (March 10, 2022), status Canceled. The Items Ordered table shows four items (sandal, pajama set, sweater, chai). There’s no AC-DC Adapter in this order. Totals show Subtotal $186.59, Shipping & Handling $20.00, Grand Total $206.59. If everything from this order was returned (which seems likely since the kept item is an adapter not on this order), the refundable amount from this order would likely be $186.59 (subtotal), excluding shipping. But to complete the full answer, I must also open the other March 2022 canceled order (likely March 2, 2022, Order #000000160) to find the AC-DC Adapter line price and its totals to compute that order’s refundable amount (grand total minus shipping minus adapter price). 

So the next step is to navigate back to My Orders from the left navigation and then open the March 2, 2022 order to get its item and pricing details.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page “My Orders” [1468] is on the critical path to the goal of finding the refund for a canceled March 2022 order while excluding shipping and the AC‑DC Adapter.
- Key elements visible and relevant:
  - Orders table [1474] with columns “Order #”, “Date”, “Order Total”, “Status”, “Action”.
  - Row actions include “View Order” links (e.g., [1491] for Order #000000170; [1502], [1513] for other rows) — all visible and enabled.
  - The list shows recent (2023) orders; pagination at the bottom indicates more orders (“items 1 to 10 of 37 total” with page links such as “2”, “3”, “4” visible in the screenshot), which is needed to reach March 2022 entries.
- Next objective from here: use pagination to navigate to older orders (March 2022) and open the canceled order(s) from that month (e.g., March 2 or March 10, 2022) via the corresponding “View Order” link to identify the AC‑DC Adapter line price and compute refundable amount = subtotal of returned items minus the AC‑DC Adapter cost, excluding shipping.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to “My Orders” and located the March 2022 canceled orders.
- Opened Order #000000173 (3/10/22, Canceled) earlier and captured totals: Subtotal $186.59; Shipping & Handling $20.00; Grand Total $206.59. This order did not include the AC-DC Adapter.
- Returned to the orders list to find the other March 2022 canceled order that likely contains the AC-DC Adapter.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page “My Orders” (heading [1468], table [1474]) is on the critical path to determine the expected refund for the canceled March 2022 order while excluding shipping and the kept AC‑DC Adapter.
- Relevant interactive elements (visible and enabled):
  - Orders table rows with “View Order” links:
    - Order #000000173 — Date: 3/10/22 — Status: Canceled — “View Order” link (example marker [1535]).
    - Order #000000160 — Date: 3/2/22 — Status: Canceled — “View Order” link (in the same row labeled “View Order”).
    - Other rows (e.g., 6/30/22 Canceled with “View Order” [1491]) are present but not directly needed.
- Next objective: Open the 3/2/22 canceled order’s “View Order” link to check line items and totals, identify the AC‑DC Adapter’s price, and compute refundable amount = (subtotal of returned items) minus the adapter price, excluding shipping (and confirm any taxes as shown on the order page).

The user needs the refund amount for the order(s) canceled in March 2022, while keeping only the AC-DC Adapter and with shipping non-refundable. On the "My Orders" page (Page 4), I see two March 2022 entries marked "Canceled": Order #000000173 (3/10/22) and Order #000000160 (3/2/22). I previously reviewed the 3/10/22 order and confirmed it doesn’t include an AC-DC Adapter, so to compute the refund correctly I must open the 3/2/22 canceled order, which likely contains the AC-DC Adapter, to see its line items and totals. The "View Order" link for Order #000000160 is element [1546]. Clicking that will show the itemized details needed to calculate the refund by excluding the shipping fee and the adapter’s price.

The user asks for the refund amount for their order(s) canceled in March 2022, noting they kept only the AC-DC Adapter and shipping is non-refundable. From prior navigation, there are two canceled orders in March 2022: 
- Order #000000173 (March 10, 2022) — previously reviewed: Items subtotal $186.59; Shipping $20.00; no AC-DC Adapter in this order.
- Order #000000160 (March 2, 2022) — currently open on the screen: Items subtotal $95.18; Shipping $20.00; includes “SupplySource AC-DC Adapter …” priced at $17.28.

Refund rules per user: shipping is not refunded; they kept only the AC-DC Adapter, so the adapter’s price should not be refunded.

Compute:
- Order #000000160 refund = subtotal ($95.18) − kept adapter ($17.28) = $77.90.
- Order #000000173 refund = subtotal ($186.59), since all items were returned and shipping is not refundable.

Combined expected refund for March 2022 canceled orders = $77.90 + $186.59 = $264.49.

No tax line is shown on either order, so no tax adjustments are considered.

I will now send a concise itemized answer with the combined total and per-order breakdown.

  - Combined expected refund = $264.49.

🔍 Current State Analysis: 
- The current page shows Order # 000000160 (status: Canceled), which is directly on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant elements/data on this page:
  - Items Ordered table (table “Items Ordered”, node [1486]) — includes the AC‑DC Adapter line item (“SupplySource AC‑DC Adapter…”) with price $17.28 and other items with their prices/qty.
  - Totals section (static text on page) — Subtotal $95.18; Shipping & Handling $20.00; Grand Total $115.18.
  - Auxiliary links (not needed for the calculation): “Reorder” ([1475], enabled) and “Print Order” ([1477], enabled).
- No further interaction is required to fulfill the goal; all needed figures are present on the order detail pages.
