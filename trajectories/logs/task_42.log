 <think>
The user asks for the top 2 search terms in their store. On the current Dashboard page, there is a "Top Search Terms" table that already lists search terms ranked by "Uses." The first two rows in that section show "hollister" with 19 uses and "Joust Bag" with 4 uses. Since the task is simply to list the top two terms, I can directly respond using the information from this table without navigating elsewhere. I will provide the two terms as a concise bullet list, preserving exact capitalization and spacing.

✅ Current Progress:
- Extracted and reported the top 2 search terms from the admin Dashboard’s “Top Search Terms” widget: hollister, Joust Bag.
- ✅ Task completed.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is the Magento Admin Dashboard, which directly displays “Top Search Terms” and “Last Search Terms” tables. This is on the critical path for the goal since the required data is visible here without further navigation.
- Relevant elements:
  - “Top Search Terms” table (visible, read-only): shows ranked search terms, with “hollister” and “Joust Bag” at the top.
  - Button “Reload Data” [714] (visible, enabled): optional if a manual refresh of dashboard metrics is needed.
- No errors or detours detected; the necessary data was obtained directly from the dashboard.
