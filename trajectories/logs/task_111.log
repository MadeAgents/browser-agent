The user requests monthly counts of successful orders from Feb to Nov 2022 in MM:COUNT format. On Magento Admin, such data is typically found under REPORTS. The current page is the Dashboard, and the top navigation shows a REPORTS menu link (bid 339). To start, I should navigate to the REPORTS section, where I can then choose the appropriate report (likely Sales > Orders) and apply date range filters and status filters (e.g., "Complete") and group by month. The first step is to click the REPORTS menu.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the Reports menu from the main navigation; the Reports overlay is visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward the goal. The Reports overlay lists relevant report links needed to obtain monthly successful order counts.
- Sales > Orders (link “Orders”, id 383): Visible link; this is the appropriate report to retrieve order counts and apply date/status filters and monthly grouping.
- Customers > Order Count (link “Order Count”, id 417): Visible but likely not suitable for total successful orders by month (focuses on counts per customer).
- Other visible links (e.g., “Invoiced” id 389, “Shipping” id 392, “Refunds” id 395, “Refresh Statistics” id 448) are not needed for the stated goal.

No errors or deviation detected; proceeding to Sales > Orders is the correct next step.

2) Select the “Complete” status in the status list (per benchmark tip, it’s a 1-of-n style selector).

The user needs monthly counts of successful orders from Feb to Nov 2022. On Magento, “successful” typically corresponds to the “Complete” order status. I’m on the Orders Report page with Period set to Month and the date range from 02/01/2022 to 11/30/2022 already filled. The Order Status is set to Specified, and a listbox of statuses is visible. Currently, one option [781] is selected, which appears to be “Closed” based on the visual highlight in the screenshot. To ensure we count successful orders, I should select “Complete.” Given the order of items in the list, the next option [782] likely corresponds to “Complete.” After selecting “Complete,” I’ll click Show Report to retrieve monthly counts.
