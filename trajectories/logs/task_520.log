The user wants to add the current product to their wishlist. On the product page, there is a visible link labeled "Add to Wish List" with accessibility node [1523]. The user appears to be logged in (header shows "Welcome, Emma Lopez!" and "My Wish List 14 items"), so clicking this link should add the item to their wishlist. No scrolling is needed, and the most direct next step is to click the "Add to Wish List" link.
