The user wants to create a new group named "coding_friends" and add members qhduan and Agnes-U.

The correct next step is to click that to reveal the dropdown options, then I can proceed to select "New group" in a subsequent step.

✅ Current Progress:
- New group “coding_friends” has been created (visible in sidebar and breadcrumbs).
- No members have been added yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Current page: Group Activity (“Activity · coding_friends · GitLab”). This page is within the group but not where members are managed, so it is not on the direct path to adding members.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - [264] link “Group information” — visible; expected to lead to the group’s info and Members management area.
  - [429] link “Team” — visible; shows team members and may offer member-related actions.
  - [344] link “Settings” — visible; not typically used for inviting members.
  - [130] textbox “Search GitLab” — visible; not required for this task.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link [264] “Group information” to access the group’s information and Members section to invite users. 
- If that doesn’t navigate as expected, click link [429] “Team” to view current members and look for invite controls.

The “Invite members” modal for the group “coding_friends” is open and ready. The textbox for “Username or email address” [668] is focused. To add members, GitLab typically expects typing a username to bring up a suggestion list to select from. I’ll start by entering the first username “qhduan” to trigger suggestions or tokenization, then I can proceed to select the suggestion and add the second user “Agnes-U” in subsequent steps. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best action is to fill the focused username field with “qhduan”.

The “Invite members” modal for the “coding_friends” group is open with the “Username or email address” textbox already filled with “qhduan”. A suggestion dropdown shows a selectable menu item for that username (“段清华DEAN qhduan”). To properly add qhduan to the invite list, I should select this suggestion, which typically tokenizes the entry. After that, I will enter “Agnes-U”, select the corresponding suggestion, and then click “Invite” to add both members. The optimal next single action now is to click the suggestion for “qhduan”.
