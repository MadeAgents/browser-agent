The user asks for the last names of the top 3 contributors to the "2019-nCov" repository, ranked by number of commits. On GitLab, the easiest way to get to a specific repo is to use the site’s search page rather than scrolling through the dashboard. The provided tips explicitly say the global search bar is not working and instruct to use a direct search URL format: http://10.177.37.113:8023/search?search=<repository-name>&nav_source=navbar. I’m currently on the Projects dashboard and don’t see "2019-nCov" listed. The next best step is to navigate to the search results for "2019-nCov". Once there, I can click into the repository and then use the "Contributors" tab to identify the top 3 by commits and extract their last names. Therefore, I will perform a goto action to the specified search URL for "2019-nCov".
