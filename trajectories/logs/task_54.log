The user asks for the walking time between Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. On the current OpenStreetMap page, there's a search bar and a "Find directions between two points" button (with two arrows), which aligns with the provided task tips. The best approach is:
1) Click the "Find directions between two points" button to open the directions panel.
2) Enter "Carnegie Mellon University" for the start and "University of Pittsburgh" for the destination, ensuring we pick the ones in Pittsburgh, PA.
3) Set the mode to walking and compute the route using the "press" or appropriate compute button.
First step is to click the directions button to bring up the interface for entering points and selecting walking mode. Avoid scrolling, and follow the instruction to use the internal map only.

The user wants the walking time from Carnegie Mellon University to the University of Pittsburgh using the current OpenStreetMap directions page. The directions panel is open, showing mode radios (currently Car), a From textbox [194], and a To textbox [199]. My previous attempt to click the Foot radio [179] failed because the Car label intercepted pointer events. To progress efficiently, I should start by entering the origin and destination. After both fields are filled, I can compute the route (likely by pressing Enter on one of the fields) and then switch to Foot mode if necessary, possibly by clicking the “Foot” label [180] instead of the radio input. For now, the best next step is to fill the From field with “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” to ensure correct location resolution in Pittsburgh.

The user wants the walking time between Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already populated with these endpoints, but the current mode is Car, showing “Distance: 2.4km. Time: 0:04,” which is not the walking time. Previous attempts to click the Foot radio [179] failed due to the Car label [174] intercepting pointer events. The accessibility tree shows a “Foot” label [180], which likely toggles the foot mode when clicked. To get the walking time, I should click the “Foot” label [180] to switch the mode to foot and trigger recalculation of the route time for walking.
