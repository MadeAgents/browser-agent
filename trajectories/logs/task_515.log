The user wants to add a white computer desk to their wish list. The current page is the homepage with a visible search bar. Using search is the fastest way to locate a specific product, per the tips. The Accessibility Tree shows the search input as a combobox with id [273], and the Search button [278] is currently disabled but likely will enable after typing. My next step is to enter a query such as "white computer desk" into the search field to find relevant products. After that, I can submit the search and then add the appropriate item to the wish list. For now, I will fill the search box.

✅ Current Progress: Entered the search query “white computer desk” into the site’s Search field.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the “One Stop Market” homepage, which is on the critical path because it provides search. The search combobox labeled “Search” (node [273]) is focused, visible, and currently filled with “white computer desk” (expanded with a listbox popup). The “Search” button (node [278]) is visible; no disabled state is indicated. Current product listings on this page show unrelated items (e.g., groceries) with “Add to Wish List” links (e.g., node [1410]) but not a white computer desk. The “My Wish List 8 items” link (node [229]) is visible and accessible for later verification after adding the correct item. The next critical action is to submit the search to navigate to relevant results.

The task is to add a white computer desk to the wish list. On the homepage, the search field is already filled with "white computer desk" (combobox [273]). The fastest way to locate the product is to submit this search to navigate to relevant results. The "Search" button (node [278]) is visible and should execute the query. After the search results load, I can look for an item that matches a white computer desk and use its "Add to Wish List" control. For now, the next best step is to click the Search button to proceed to the results.

The goal is to add a white computer desk to the wish list. We are already on the search results page for "white computer desk," which displays multiple relevant products. Each product in the grid has action buttons, including "Add to Wish List." This allows adding directly without opening the product page. The first product, "EMMA + OLIVER White Computer Desk with Keyboard Tray and Drawers," is clearly a white computer desk and has the "Add to Wish List" button identified as [1427] in the accessibility tree. Clicking this should add the item to the wish list, increasing the count from 8 items. Therefore, the next best action is to click the "Add to Wish List" button for this product.
