The user wants the order number of their most recent pending order. To find this, I should navigate to their account area and then to the orders section. On the current homepage, there's a "My Account" link in the top banner (accessibility node [227]). Clicking this is the correct first step to reach account details, where I can then look for "My Orders" and filter or identify the most recent order with status "Pending." I will click "My Account" to proceed.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “My Account” page and located the “Recent Orders” table where order numbers and statuses are visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to the goal. The “Recent Orders” table (accessible name: “Recent Orders”, node [1534]) is visible with columns “Order #”, “Date”, “Ship To”, “Order Total”, “Status”, and “Action”. At least one row shows Status = “Pending”. Relevant elements:
- Table “Recent Orders” [1534]: cells under “Order #” (text values), “Status” (includes “Pending”), all visible.
- Link “View All” [1530]: enabled and visible; useful if more orders are needed beyond the recent list.
- Action links “View Order” (visible text in each row): enabled; can open full order details if needed.
No errors or off-track indicators; the needed information (order # for the most recent pending order) can be read directly from the first row in this table whose “Status” equals “Pending”.

The user is already on the My Account page, and the “Recent Orders” table is visible. I need to identify the most recent order with Status = “Pending.” The table lists:
- 000000170 (5/17/23) — Canceled
- 000000189 (5/2/23) — Pending
- 000000188 (5/2/23) — Pending
- 000000187 (5/2/23) — Pending
- 000000180 (3/11/23) — Complete

Among pending orders, they share the same date (5/2/23). The highest order number typically indicates the most recent in sequence. Therefore, the most recent pending order is 000000189. I will return this order number to the user.
