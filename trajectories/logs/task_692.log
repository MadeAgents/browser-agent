The user wants me to draft an email to the shop owner using the site's "Contact Us" function. To ensure the draft matches the fields and expectations of the site's contact form (e.g., subject, message, name, email), I should first navigate to the "Contact Us" page. I can see a "Contact Us" link in the footer with accessibility node [1862]. Clicking this will open the contact page where I can review the form fields and then compose an appropriate draft. I will not submit the email, per instructions; I will only draft the content. The immediate next step is to click the "Contact Us" link.

The user wants me to draft an email via the site's Contact Us function requesting a coupon as a student. The Contact Us form is open, with Name and Email already populated (Emma Lopez and emma.lopez@gmail.com). The required field "What’s on your mind? *" is currently empty and needs the drafted message. To progress, I should fill that textbox with a polite, clear request for a student discount/coupon, including the user's name and email, and an offer to provide proof of enrollment. I will not submit the form, per the instructions; I’ll just draft the content and place it into the message field now.
