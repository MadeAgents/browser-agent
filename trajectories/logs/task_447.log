The user wants me to assign an issue in the "a11y-webring.club" project to Rohan. I'm currently on the GitLab dashboard showing the list of projects. I can see the "Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club" project listed with the link element [509]. The next logical step is to navigate into this project's page. Once there, I should access the Issues tab, locate the issue about "linking to an accessibility statement", open it, and change the assignee to Rohan. For now, the best next single action is to click the project link to enter the repository. I will avoid using the global search bar per tips. After landing on the project page, I can proceed to the Issues tab and further steps.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward assigning the issue; the next step is to open the project’s Issues list. Relevant interactive elements:
- Sidebar link “Issues” (node [332], visible, enabled, shows count “4”) under Project navigation — use this to view all project issues.
- Breadcrumb “a11y-webring.club” (node [595], visible) — confirms current project context.
- Global “Search GitLab” textbox (node [146], visible, empty) — available but not necessary for this task.

The goal is to assign the issue about linking to an accessibility statement to Rohan within the a11y-webring.club project. I’m currently on the project’s main page, as confirmed by the breadcrumb and project header. To perform assignment, I need to navigate to the project’s Issues list first. The left sidebar under Project navigation has a clearly labeled “Issues” link with a visible count of 4, which is the most direct way to access all issues for this project. I should click this “Issues” link to reach the issues list where I can locate the specific issue and then assign it to Rohan.

The goal is to assign the specific issue about linking to an accessibility statement to Rohan. I’m already on the project’s Issues list page with the “Open 4” tab selected. I can see the exact issue titled “[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement” (Issue #71) in the first row, and it’s currently “Assigned to Byte Blaze.” To change the assignee, the standard GitLab flow is to open the issue details page and use the sidebar to modify the Assignee. Therefore, the next best action is to click the issue link “[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement” (bid 736) to open its detail view, where I can change the assignee to Rohan.

✅ Current Progress: Attempted to open the target issue (“Support linking to an accessibility statement”) from the project’s Issues list. No assignment changes have been made yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page appears blank or failed to load. The accessibility tree only shows a RootWebArea with no interactive elements, and the screenshot is empty. This is off the critical path because the issue details (with the Assignee control) are not accessible from this state.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Refresh the page to load the issue details. If the issue page loads, locate the Assignee control in the sidebar and change it to “Rohan.”
- If refresh doesn’t work, use the browser Back action to return to the Issues list, then open the issue titled “[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement” again to proceed with assignment.
