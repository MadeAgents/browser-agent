The user wants me to notify Grace Nguyen in their most recent pending order with a specific message. In Magento Admin, the proper way is:
1) Go to Sales > Orders.
2) Filter to Pending status, then sort by Purchase Date descending to ensure we get the most recent pending order (this aligns with the benchmark tip requiring sorting).
3) Filter by Customer Name "Grace Nguyen" or search for the customer in the grid.
4) Open the topmost order (most recent pending).
5) In the order view, use the Comments History area to add a comment, check "Notify Customer by Email", and submit the comment with the message provided.

From the current page (Dashboard), I need to navigate to the Orders grid. The top navigation shows a "SALES" link, which usually leads to the Orders page or opens a menu where "Orders" is the first option. The simplest next action is to click the "SALES" menu link to get into the Sales section (ideally Orders). I will click the SALES link [156].

- Link 'Invoices' (id: 171), 'Shipments' (id: 174), etc. — visible but not needed for the goal.

After clicking Orders, you can locate Grace Nguyen’s most recent Pending order and add a customer notification comment with the provided message.

The goal is to notify Grace Nguyen on their most recent pending order with a specific message. To do this in Magento, I need to navigate to the Orders grid first. From the Dashboard, the Sales menu is already open on the left, and I can see the "Orders" link (bid 168). Clicking "Orders" will take me to the orders list where I can filter by status "Pending", sort by Purchase Date descending (as required by the benchmark), then search for "Grace Nguyen" to find their most recent pending order.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the Sales > Orders grid. The Status filter “Pending” is already applied.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to the goal, but the current keyword filter is incorrect and yields no results.
- Textbox “Search by keyword” (id: 852) — visible, filled with “Jane Doe” (incorrect for the goal).

- Button “Clear all” (id: 874) — available if filters need resetting.
- Orders table shows “0 records found”; column header “↑ Purchase Date” (id: 1412) — clickable for sorting (currently ascending).

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Replace the keyword: type “Grace Nguyen” into the textbox labeled “Search by keyword” (id: 852), then click the “Search” button (id: 853).
- After results load, click the “Purchase Date” column header (id: 1412) to sort by most recent first.

The user's goal is to notify Grace Nguyen in their most recent pending order with the provided message. I have already navigated to the correct order page (#000000065) which is Pending and belongs to Grace Nguyen. In the "Notes for this Order" section, the Comment textbox [1033] contains the exact message "sorry we are bankrupt, please contact our customer service for refund". The "Notify Customer by Email" checkbox [1037] is currently checked (checked='true'), which ensures the customer will receive an email notification. To complete the task, I need to submit the comment so it is recorded on the order and the email is sent. The appropriate control is the "Submit Comment" button [1043]. The next best single action is to click that button.

The user asked me to notify Grace Nguyen on her most recent pending order with a specific message.
