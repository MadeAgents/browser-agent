The user wants a storage option for Nintendo Switch game cards to fit all 23 cards. The homepage shows a top navigation menu with a "Video Games" category (element 1189) that has a popup submenu. Per site tips, it's better to use the dropdown navigation than the search. The next step is to hover over "Video Games" to reveal subcategories like Nintendo Switch accessories or storage cases.

✅ Current Progress: Hovered the “Video Games” category, revealing its submenu. The “Nintendo Switch” submenu item is visible and ready to select.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the site’s home with general product showcases (not yet filtered to Nintendo Switch). This is on the critical path since the “Video Games” menu is open and “Nintendo Switch” is available to click.
- Relevant elements:
  - Menuitem “Video Games” (id 1189), hasPopup=menu, visible.
  - Submenu item “Nintendo Switch” (id 1235), visible/clickable.
  - Search input combobox labeled “Search” (id 386), empty, focusable; Search button (id 391) is currently disabled until text is entered.
  - Link “Advanced Search” (id 389), visible.
The product grid and “Add to Cart” buttons shown are unrelated to the goal until we navigate to Nintendo Switch accessories/cases.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “Nintendo Switch” category page, showing a product grid (Items 1–12 of 51). Category selection from the main menu is complete.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward finding a storage solution for Nintendo Switch game cards, but results are broad (controllers, cables, cases, etc.) and not yet filtered to “game card holder/case” products that specify capacity (≥23).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Search field: combobox labeled “Search” (id 388), empty, focusable; Search button (id 393) is currently disabled until text is entered; “Advanced Search” link (id 391) is visible.
  - Sorting: “Sort By” combobox (id 1502), set to “Position”; options include “Product Name” and “Price”.
  - Product grid items with title links and “Add to Cart” buttons:
    - Example item link (id 1520): “PowerA 1506261-01 Wired Controller for Nintendo Switch - Mario” — not relevant to card storage.
    - Example item link (id 1566): “Accessories Bundle for Nintendo Switch OLED Model(2021) Super Kit with Carrying Case…” — includes a carrying case but not clearly a dedicated game card holder or stated capacity.
  - View toggle: “View as List” link (id 1494), visible.
- No filters specifically targeting “game card cases/holders” are apparent in the “Shop By” section; using search is likely necessary to locate a card holder with a capacity of at least 23.

The user needs a storage option for 23 Nintendo Switch game cards. We’re currently on the Nintendo Switch category page showing a variety of accessories, not specifically game card storage. The fastest way to find a dedicated card holder with specified capacity is to use the site’s search bar. The “Search” combobox (id 388) is available and the Search button (id 393) is disabled until text is entered. I will enter a targeted query like “Nintendo Switch game card case” to bring up relevant products that typically list slot counts (e.g., 24/28 slots), then I can evaluate to ensure it fits 23 cards.

The user needs a storage option for 23 Nintendo Switch game cards. We’re on the Nintendo Switch category page, and I already filled the site search field with the query "Nintendo Switch game card case." To get relevant results showing card holders (which usually list slot capacity like 24 or 28), I should execute the search. The Search button (id 393) is visible next to the search combobox (id 388). Clicking the Search button should take us to a results page where I can identify a case that fits at least 23 cards. Using the search is consistent with the benchmark tips emphasizing search over scrolling.
