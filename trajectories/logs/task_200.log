✅ Current Progress: The Sales menu has been opened from the Magento Admin dashboard. No navigation to the Orders list has occurred yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is the Magento Admin Dashboard, which is on the path to the goal since the Orders list is accessible from the Sales menu. The Sales flyout is visible and expanded.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link: “Orders” (axtree id: 168) — visible, enabled/clickable.
  - Link: “Invoices” (171) — visible, enabled (not directly needed for the goal).
  - Link: “Shipments” (174) — visible, enabled (not needed).
  - Other dashboard controls (e.g., “Reload Data” button 714) are unrelated to the goal.
To retrieve the billing name of the oldest complete order, the next critical page is the Orders grid (via “Sales” > “Orders”), where filtering by Status = Complete and sorting by Purchase Date ascending can be performed.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal. To get the billing name of the oldest complete order, the list must be filtered to Status = Complete and sorted by Purchase Date (oldest first), after which the “Bill-to Name” of the first row can be read directly from the grid.
- Relevant elements:
  - Filters panel toggle: button labeled “Filters” (id: 845) — visible, enabled.
  - Active filter indicator: “Active filters: Status: Pending” — currently restricting results to Pending only.
  - Clear filters: “Clear all” button (id: 857) — visible, enabled.
  - Sorting control: column header “Purchase Date” (id: 1390, currently shows “↑ Purchase Date”) — clickable to change sort order.
  - Data to extract: column “Bill-to Name” (header id: 1392) — cells visible per row.
  - Status column (header id: 1400) — confirms current rows show “Pending,” so not yet matching the goal condition (“Complete”).
  - Row-level “View” links (e.g., id: 1479, 1555, 1609, etc.) — optional; not required if the billing name is readable from the grid.

The task is to get the billing name of the oldest complete order. I’m on the Orders grid in Magento Admin with the Filters panel open. To identify the oldest complete order, I should:
1) Filter the orders by Status = Complete.
2) Ensure sorting by Purchase Date is ascending (oldest first). The header shows "↑ Purchase Date", which suggests ascending sort is already applied.
3) Read the Bill-to Name from the first row after filtering, since with ascending sort the first row would be the oldest.

The accessibility tree shows the Status field as a combobox with options including "Complete" (element id 972). I should use select_option on that element to choose "Complete".
