The user wants the top-3 best-selling products in January 2023. The Dashboard shows a Bestsellers widget, but it doesn't allow setting a date range, so it's not sufficient.

Therefore, the next step is to navigate to REPORTS to find the Bestsellers report and apply the January 2023 date filter.

The user needs the top-3 best-selling products for January 2023. The Dashboard widget shows some bestselling items but lacks date filtering.

The next best step is to click on "Bestsellers" to navigate to that report page, where I will apply the date range for January 2023 and then view/sort the results to identify the top 3.

The task is to find the top-3 best-selling products in January 2023 using the Bestsellers report page currently open. The report shows "0 records found" because the filters (Period, From, To) are not set. To get January 2023, I should set Period to "Month" and then set the From and To date range to cover January 2023. The first step is to change the Period combobox from "Day" to "Month" to enable month-level aggregation. After that, I will set the date range and run the report.

The user asks for the top-3 best-selling products in January 2023. I’m already on the Bestsellers Report page with Period set to Month and the date range From 1/1/23 to 1/31/23. I clicked “Show Report” and the table shows one interval (1/2023) with products and their order quantities. I need to read off the top-3 by Order Quantity. The table lists:
- Impulse Duffle — 2
- Overnight Duffle — 2
- Hawkeye Yoga Short-32-Blue — 2
- Fiona Fitness Short-28-Green — 1
- Atlas Fitness Tank-L-Blue — 1
Thus, the top-3 items are the three with quantity 2. I will now report these names exactly as shown, along with quantities to give clear context.
