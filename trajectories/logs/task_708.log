The user requests to generate a tax report for this year, with “today” being 3/15/2023. In Magento, tax reports are under the REPORTS menu. From the dashboard, I should navigate to REPORTS to access the tax reporting options. Once in REPORTS, I’ll look for a “Tax” (or “Sales > Tax”) section where I can set the date range. The appropriate date range for “this year” would be From 01/01/2023 to 03/15/2023. The next step is to open the REPORTS menu first to find the Tax report page. On the current page, the top navigation bar contains a link with the label REPORTS (bid 339). I will click that to proceed to the reports section where I can then select the tax report and set the date range.

The user asked to generate a tax report for this year with today being 3/15/2023. I navigated to Reports > Sales > Tax, set From to 01/01/2023 and To to 03/15/2023, kept Date Used as Order Created, Period as Day, Order Status as Any, Empty Rows as No, and clicked Show Report. The results table shows “0 records found,” meaning there are no taxable orders in that date range under the current filters and scope (All Websites). Since exporting is discouraged by task tips, the best next step is to inform the user that the report has been generated and report the result, and offer to adjust filters (e.g., Period to Month/Year or show empty rows) if they want a different presentation. I will send a concise message summarizing the filters and outcome and ask how they’d like to proceed.
