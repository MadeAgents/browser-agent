The user wants to compare walking and driving times between two Pittsburgh locations. On the OpenStreetMap homepage, I see the search bar and a link labeled "Find directions between two points" (bid 167), which corresponds to the directions tool (the "two arrow" button mentioned in tips). Clicking this should open the directions panel where I can enter the start and end locations and select transport modes (walking and driving). This is the correct first step before entering addresses and computing routes.

The goal is to compare walking and driving times between two points in Pittsburgh using the OpenStreetMap directions panel currently open on the left. The panel shows:
- Mode radios: Car (checked), Bicycle, Foot
- Directions service: OSRM
- Textboxes: "From" [194], "To" [199]
- Reverse button

To proceed, I should input the start and destination. Following the tips, provide clear Pittsburgh context to avoid mislocation. First, I will fill the "From" field with "5000 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA". After that, I’ll fill "To" with "UPMC family health center, Pittsburgh, PA" and trigger routing. But since only one action is allowed per step, start by filling the From field.

The task is to compare walking and driving times between two Pittsburgh locations using the OpenStreetMap directions tool. The directions panel is already open with:
- Mode radios: Car (checked), Bicycle, Foot
- Service: OSRM
- From field [194]: already resolved to the full address of 5000 Fifth Avenue in Pittsburgh
- To field [199]: "UPMC family health center, Pittsburgh, PA" and currently focused

No route results (time/distance) are visible yet, meaning the route likely hasn't been computed. On OSM, after filling From/To, pressing Enter in the To field typically triggers route calculation. While there is an unlabeled button [518] that could be a compute button, the most reliable next step is to trigger the computation by pressing Enter in the focused To field. This will produce the driving route first (since Car is already selected). Once the driving time appears, I can switch to the Foot radio to compute the walking time and then compare.

Therefore, the immediate next action is to press Enter on the To field [199] to compute the driving route.

The directions panel is already open with Car selected. The "From" field is the full address for 5000 Fifth Avenue in Pittsburgh, and the "To" field has been refined to "UPMC Shadyside Family Health Center, Pittsburgh, PA" and is currently focused. Previously, an Enter press caused a search failure for the ambiguous term; now that the destination is specific, the next step is to trigger route calculation. On OpenStreetMap, pressing Enter in the focused "To" field typically computes the route.
