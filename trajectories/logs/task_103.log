The user wants to display issues in the kkroening/ffmpeg-python repository that have labels related to questions. I’m currently on the Projects dashboard. Per the provided tips, the global search bar is not working, and I should use the specific search URL format to find repositories. The correct approach is to navigate to the search page using the project name only, which is "ffmpeg-python". From there, I can click into the kkroening/ffmpeg-python project, go to its Issues tab, and then filter by labels like "question". My next best single action is to navigate to the search URL for ffmpeg-python.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to GitLab search results for “ffmpeg-python”; the target project “Karl Kroening / ffmpeg-python” is visible in results.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward the goal. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link [323] “Karl Kroening / ffmpeg-python” — visible and enabled; leads to the repository page.
- Category link [293] “Issues 99” — visible and enabled; lists search-matched issues across GitLab (not necessarily scoped to the repository).
- Searchbox [231] “Search for projects, issues, etc.” — filled with value “ffmpeg-python”; buttons [235] “Search” and [232] “Clear” are visible and enabled.
- Filters: [240] button “Any” (Group) and [263] button “Any” (Project) — visible, collapsed menus.

The most relevant next interaction is the project link [323] to access the repository, then navigate to its Issues tab and filter by labels related to questions.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward the goal of listing issues with question-related labels. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link [326] “Issues” (Project navigation) — visible and enabled; shows count “402”; this will lead to the repository’s issue list where labels can be filtered.
- Link [295] “Repository” — visible and enabled; not needed for issue listing.
- Textbox [146] “Search GitLab” — visible; global search and not scoped to this repository’s issues.
- Top navigation link [177] “Issues” — visible; likely site-wide and not scoped to the current project.

No progress made yet on filtering by labels; the next step requires accessing the repository’s Issues page to apply label filters.

The goal is to display issues in the kkroening/ffmpeg-python repository that have question-related labels. I’m already on the repository’s Issues page with the Open tab selected. The most efficient way to filter is to use the “Search or filter results…” textbox visible on this page (element [555]) and apply a label filter. Since there is no visible “Labels” dropdown in the accessibility tree and scrolling is not supported, I’ll use the search/filter input’s token syntax. A common, likely-to-work filter is “label:question” to match issues with the “question” label. The next step is to fill the search field with this filter, then in a subsequent step click the Search button to apply it. I’ll first fill the input with “label:question”.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened the “Karl Kroening / ffmpeg-python” repository’s Issues page.
- Entered the label filter “label:question” into the issues search/filter textbox.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is directly on the critical path to the goal (repository-scoped Issues list).
- Relevant elements:
  - Textbox [1221] “Search or filter results…” — value set to “label:question”, visible, enabled, focused.
  - Button [557] “Search” — visible and enabled.
  - Tabs: [507] “Open 402” (selected), [511] “Closed 221”, [515] “All 623” — all visible and enabled.
  - Issues list [621] — visible. It’s unclear if results are filtered yet because an earlier Search click targeted a different input; the latest fill into [1221] has not been followed by a confirmed Search action.
- No off-track indicators; page is correct.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button [557] “Search” to apply the “label:question” filter.
- If you need both open and closed question-labeled issues, after applying the filter click tab [515] “All 623”.

The goal is to display issues in the kkroening/ffmpeg-python repository that have question-related labels. I am on the repository’s Issues page with the Open tab selected. The “Search or filter results…” textbox (bid 1221) is already filled with "label:question", which is the correct GitLab filter syntax. To apply this filter and update the issue list, I should click the adjacent “Search” button (bid 557). This will display the filtered list of issues tagged with the “question” label. If needed later, I could switch to the "All" tab to include both open and closed, but first I need to apply the filter.

The user’s goal is to display the list of issues in the kkroening/ffmpeg-python repository that have labels related to questions. I navigated to the repository’s Issues page and used the built-in “Search or filter results…” box, which supports GitLab query tokens. The textbox currently shows value “label:question”, meaning the filter for issues labeled “question” is applied. The issues list below reflects this filter. The Open tab is selected, so these are currently open issues with the “question” label. To confirm completion and offer next steps (e.g., include closed issues), the appropriate next action is to inform the user that the filtered list is displayed and ask if they want all (open and closed) issues.
