The user wants me to draft a refund message via the site's "Contact Us" form for a phone case purchased in March 2023, including the order ID, reason, and refund amount. I need the order ID and the amount from the user's purchase history. The Task Tips say to go to My Account > My Orders to find previous purchases. On the current homepage, I see a "My Account" link in the banner (bid 227). The best next step is to click "My Account" to access account details and then find "My Orders" for March 2023 to retrieve the order ID and price. After obtaining these, I can navigate to "Contact Us" and fill in the message. For now, I will click "My Account".

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path because the goal requires the order ID and refund amount from a past purchase (March 2023), which should be found in order history.
- Relevant elements:
  - Link “View All” (axtree id [1418]) — visible/enabled; use to access full order history beyond the most recent entries.
  - Table “Recent Orders” (axtree id [1422]) — visible; contains per-order action links such as “View Order” (visible in the screenshot within the Action column), which are needed to open order details and item pricing.
  - Footer link “Contact Us” (visible in the screenshot) — needed later to open the contact form to draft the refund message. The form is not yet open.
- The current page does not yet provide the contact form; it is appropriate for gathering the order ID and amount first. No deviation detected.

The user needs a refund message via the site's "Contact Us" form that includes the order ID, reason, and amount for a phone case bought in March 2023. To draft an accurate message, I must first retrieve the specific order ID and the total (or item price) from the user's order history. The current page is "My Account" and shows a side navigation with "My Orders" (bid 1502). This should lead to the full order history where I can locate orders from March 2023 and identify the phone case purchase. Clicking "My Orders" is the most direct way to access the complete order list, more reliable than the "Recent Orders" which only shows 2025 entries. After I find the order details, I will navigate to "Contact Us" to draft the message and fill the message field with the required info, ensuring not to submit. The next step is to click "My Orders".

The user wants me to draft a refund message via the "Contact Us" form for a phone case purchased in March 2023, including the order ID, reason, and amount to refund, and not submit it yet. To draft an accurate message, I need the order ID and the item amount from the specific order. On the current "My Orders" page, I can see two March 2023 orders: 000000180 dated 3/11/23 with $65.32, and 000000166 dated 3/10/23 with $17.99. The $17.99 total strongly suggests a single low-cost item like a phone case. To confirm the item details and capture the exact refund amount, I should open the order details for the 3/10/23 entry. The “View Order” link for this row is [1412]. Clicking it will show the order contents, including the product name and price, enabling me to accurately draft the message later on the Contact Us form.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the order details page for Order #000000166 (Order Date: March 10, 2023). The page shows item price $12.99, shipping $5.00, and grand total $17.99. No refund message has been drafted yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This is an order details page, but it does not contain the phone case—the item listed is “Kosher MRE Meat Meals…”, so it appears to be the wrong March 2023 order for the goal. The correct path is to locate the March 2023 phone case order and then draft the message via the “Contact Us” form.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Heading “Order # 000000166” [1355] — visible.
  - “Reorder” link [1363] — visible, enabled (not needed).
  - “Print Order” link [1365] — visible, enabled (not needed).
  - Left account navigation link “Orders” [1471] — visible, enabled; returns to the full orders list.
  - Footer “Contact Us” link [1603] — visible, enabled; to be used after confirming the correct order details.
  - “Items Ordered” table [1374] — visible; shows non-phone-case item.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the left navigation link labeled “Orders” (element [1471]) to return to the orders list.
- In the orders list, open the March 2023 phone case order by clicking the “View Order” link for Order #000000180 (element [1401]) to confirm the item and capture the order ID and refund amount before navigating to “Contact Us” [1603].
