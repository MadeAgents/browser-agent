 <think>
The user's goal is to add the current product to their wishlist. On the product page, I see a clear "Add to Wish List" link with accessibility id [1693]. The user is already logged in (banner shows "Welcome, Emma Lopez" and "My Wish List 14 items"), so clicking this should add the product to the wishlist without needing to sign in. While the product has required options for Color and Size for adding to cart, Magento typically allows adding configurable products to the wishlist and may prompt for options later when moving from wishlist to cart. Therefore, the best next step is to click the "Add to Wish List" link.

The user asked to add “this product” to their wishlist. In the prior step, I clicked the “Add to Wish List” control. Now I’m on the “My Wish List” page, and there’s a clear green success alert [1414] stating: “iPhone 13 Pro Max Case, Neon Turtle iPhone 13 Pro Max Cases, Tempered Glass Back+Soft Silicone TPU Shock Protective Case for Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max has been added to your Wish List.” The header and sidebar both indicate “My Wish List 14 items,” which corroborates that the product has been added. Since the task goal is achieved, the appropriate next step is to confirm success to the user via a message, referencing the exact product name and optionally offering next steps. No further page interaction is necessary.
