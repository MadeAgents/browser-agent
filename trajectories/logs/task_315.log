The user requests the email addresses of the top 3 contributors to the "Pytorch GAN" repository, ranked by number of commits. I’m on the GitLab dashboard. The general tips indicate that the global search bar is not working and I should instead use the search URL directly. Therefore, the best next step is to navigate to the search page using the special search URL with the project name. I will search for "Pytorch GAN" using the encoded URL. Once on the project page, I’ll navigate to the repository’s Contributors tab to get commit counts and hopefully email addresses; if the email addresses are not displayed there, I may need to click into contributors or commits to extract emails. First, I need to find the repository via the search URL.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated from search results into the target repository page: “Erik Linder-Norén / PyTorch-GAN” on GitLab.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward the goal. You are on the project overview, which provides access to commits and analytics needed to identify top contributors and retrieve their emails.
- Navigation link: [291] “Repository” — visible and clickable. Likely leads to repository sub-sections (e.g., Files, Commits, Contributors).
- Navigation link: [421] “Analytics” — visible and clickable. May include contributor statistics.
- Overview metric link: [594] “193 Commits” — visible and clickable; opens the commit list, where commit detail pages typically expose author emails.
- Breadcrumb: [498] “PyTorch-GAN” — confirms correct repository context.
No errors or deviations detected; the next required information (top contributors by commits, then emails from their commits) should be reachable via the Repository/Analytics sections and commit pages.

The user asked for the email addresses of the top 3 contributors to the PyTorch-GAN repository, ranked by number of commits. We are on the project’s main page for “Erik Linder-Norén / PyTorch-GAN.” To identify the top contributors by commit count, the most direct route is to navigate to the repository’s Contributors view. Based on GitLab’s UI, the repository section includes a sub-navigation with links like Commits, Branches, Tags, and often Contributors. On this page, I see a clickable metric “193 Commits,” which should lead to the commits page, where the sub-navigation typically includes a "Contributors" tab. Clicking “193 Commits” is the logical next step to access the sub-navigation and then proceed to the Contributors tab to get the ranking by commit counts. From there, I can open a top contributor’s commits to extract their email from a commit detail page. First, I will navigate to the commits page via the visible “193 Commits” link.
