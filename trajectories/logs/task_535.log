The user asked me to follow three specific users on GitLab. I need to find their user profiles and click the Follow button on each. From the current dashboard page, there is no direct user search, and the "Filter by name" applies to projects. A likely path is via the "Explore" section, which often includes tabs for Projects, Users, and Groups where I can search or browse users. Therefore, the best next step is to click the "Explore" link to navigate to the explore area and look for a Users tab or search functionality for users.

✅ Current Progress: No progress made yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: You are on “Projects · Explore · GitLab,” which lists projects, not users. To follow users, you need to reach user profile pages or a users search/results page. Relevant elements:
- textbox labeled “Search GitLab” (node [111]) — visible, enabled, currently empty.
- searchbox “Filter by name” (node [254]) — applies to projects only; not useful for finding users to follow.
This page is not directly on the critical path to following users.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the textbox labeled “Search GitLab” (node [111]), type “Jakub K”, and press Enter to navigate to search results where you can find the user profile to follow. Repeat for “ghost” and “Benoît Blanchon” after completing the first search.

Goal: Follow three users on GitLab: 'Jakub K', 'ghost', 'Benoît Blanchon'. I am currently on a 404 "Not Found" page at /explore/users. The page shows a small navigation with a "Home" link, which should take me back to a more functional area of the site to proceed with finding users. The prior attempt to click "Home" used a bid that didn’t exist (294). The accessibility tree shows a link 'Home' with identifier [21]. Based on past interactions, these identifiers often map to valid element bids. To recover from the 404 and continue, the best next step is to click the "Home" link using bid '21'. After returning home, I can look for a users listing (possibly via /users) or other navigational options to find and follow the specified users. Only one action is allowed now, so I will click the "Home" link.

The goal is to follow three users: 'Jakub K', 'ghost', and 'Benoît Blanchon'. I’m on the Projects dashboard, which is not directly useful for finding user profiles. The global search bar is noted as not working, but the task tips recommend using the search URL endpoint for repository searches; GitLab’s search results page typically supports multiple scopes including Users. A practical next step is to use the search URL with the query for one of the target usernames and see if the results page provides a Users tab or directly lists user accounts. I will start with 'ghost' since it’s a distinctive username and likely to appear.

The goal is to follow three users: 'Jakub K', 'ghost', and 'Benoît Blanchon'. I've already followed 'ghost' and 'Jakub K'. I’m on the search results page for "Benoît Blanchon" with the Users scope active and see a single matching user listed as "Benoît Blanchon @bblanchon". To follow him, I first need to open his profile page where the Follow button will be available. The link with bid [317] corresponds to "Benoît Blanchon @bblanchon". The best next step is to click this link to navigate to his profile.
