The user asks for the zip code of Columbia University. I need to use the OpenStreetMap website currently open. The best way is to use the search bar rather than trying to navigate the map manually. The search textbox (bid 162) is focused and visible with a "Go" button (bid 165). I will first enter "Columbia University" into the search field, then in the next step click the Go button to retrieve results, and subsequently select the correct entry to view its address details including the ZIP code.

✅ Current Progress: Entered the query “Columbia University” into the OpenStreetMap search field.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page (OpenStreetMap home) is appropriate for finding location details needed to obtain the zip code. Key elements:
- [162] textbox labeled “Search” — filled with “Columbia University”, focused, visible, enabled.
- [165] button “Go” — visible and enabled; needs to be clicked to run the search.
- [217] button “Close” (welcome panel) — optional; can be closed but not required for the search workflow.

The user asks for the zip code of Columbia University and the OpenStreetMap page is already open with the search textbox focused and containing "Columbia University". According to the task tips, I should use the site’s own search rather than any external engine. The next logical step is to execute the search by clicking the "Go" button associated with the search field. This should bring up search results, from which I can select the appropriate entry (likely in New York, NY) to view details including the ZIP code. I will not close the welcome panel yet since it’s not blocking the search. I will click the Go button (bid 165) to proceed.

The user needs the ZIP code of Columbia University. I'm on the OpenStreetMap search page, and I already clicked "Go" for "Columbia University," but the results show a loading spinner and no entries yet. To expedite and ensure the correct result (in New York), I should refine the query to "Columbia University, New York, NY" to disambiguate and help Nominatim return the exact campus entry that includes a ZIP code. The search textbox [162] is present and previously used; I'll fill it with the refined query. After this, the next step would be to press "Go" to load results, then select the correct result to view its full address and extract the ZIP code.
