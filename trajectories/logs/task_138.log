The user's goal is to find the estimated driving time between "the big apple" (New York City) and "the city with the most authentic Philly cheesesteaks" (Philadelphia). On the OpenStreetMap page, the best way is to use the built-in directions feature rather than manually panning/zooming. The interface shows a link labeled "Find directions between two points" with bid 167. Clicking it should open the directions panel where I can enter the start and end locations, choose driving mode, and compute the route. This aligns with the provided task tips about using the two-arrow button for routes. The first step is to click that directions link.

The user wants the estimated driving time between “the big apple” (New York, NY) and “the city with the most authentic Philly cheesesteaks” (Philadelphia, PA). The OpenStreetMap Directions panel is already open with “Car” selected (best for driving time). To compute a route, I need to enter the origin and destination into the “From” and “To” textboxes, then trigger route calculation (usually by pressing Enter after filling the “To” field). Since only one action is allowed per step, I will begin by filling the “From” field with “New York, NY”. Next steps will be to fill the “To” field with “Philadelphia, PA” and press Enter to get the route and its estimated driving time.

No route results (time/distance) are visible yet, implying the route hasn’t been calculated. On OSM, pressing Enter in the "To" field typically triggers route computation. The task tips also suggest using the press action after inputting both fields.
