The user wants to add a very specific product to their wish list. The fastest way to locate it is to use the site's search bar rather than navigating categories. On the current homepage, there is a search combobox labeled "Search" with bid 273 and a disabled Search button that likely enables after typing. My next step is to enter the full product name into the search field to retrieve relevant results, after which I can proceed to add the item to the wish list.

✅ Current Progress: Entered the full product name into the site’s Search field.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page (homepage) is on the critical path toward the goal. The search combobox labeled “Search” (element [273]) is focused and contains the exact target product name. The “Search” button (element [278]) is present and visible. “Advanced Search” (element [276]) is also available but not necessary. The header shows “My Wish List 3 items” (element [229]), confirming the account is logged in and a wish list exists. Product showcase tiles on this page include “Add to Wish List” links (e.g., [1410]), but they are for different products; the next step is to run the search to locate the specific product page where its own “Add to Wish List” control will be available.

The user’s goal is to add a specific product to their wish list. I already entered the exact product name into the search combobox (element [273]), which is focused and shows the full query. The next logical step is to execute the search to navigate to the results page containing this product. On the current page, the Search button (element [278]) is visible. Clicking it should trigger the search, display matching products, and then I can proceed to locate the exact item and use its “Add to Wish List” control. Since the environment discourages scrolling and I’ve already populated the search field, clicking the Search button is the best next action.

✅ Current Progress: Executed the search and arrived on the search results page. The exact target product appears in the results grid.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward the goal. Relevant elements:
- Product link with visible text “DkRgVNY Lace Spcling Lingerie Womens Sexy Hollow Out Underwear Bodysuit One Piece Snap Crotch Clubwear Teddy Bodysuit” — visible and clickable in the results grid.
- “Add to Cart” button under product tiles (e.g., element [1418], enabled) — not the desired action for adding to wish list.
- Header link “My Wish List 3 items” (element [230], visible) — confirms the wish list exists and can be viewed after adding items.
No “Add to Wish List” control is visible directly on the grid tiles, so the likely next step is to open the product detail page where the wish list action is typically available.
