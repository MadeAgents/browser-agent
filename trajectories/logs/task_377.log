✅ Current Progress:
- Map is centered on CMU ArtPark Lab.
- “Query features” mode is active, and a map click was registered; the left panel now shows results with “Nearby features: Park — CMU ArtPark Lab.”

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- On-track: This OpenStreetMap “Query Features” page is appropriate for finding nearby restaurants.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - [401] Map area — visible/clickable; used to query nearby POIs. Current click returned only the park feature, suggesting the click was on the park itself.
  - [603] “Nearby features” list — visible; currently lists “Park — CMU ArtPark Lab” (link).
  - [605]/[610] “Enclosing features” — visible; lists boundaries (Neighborhood, City, County, etc.).
  - [454] “Query features” toggle — visible/active.
  - [434] “Zoom In” and [436] “Zoom Out” — visible/enabled; can adjust scale to better target POIs.
  - [162] “Search” textbox — filled with “CMU ArtPark Lab, Pittsburgh, PA” (editable).
  - [165] “Go” button — visible/enabled.
  - [209] “Close” — visible/enabled; closes the left panel if more map space is needed.
- To surface restaurants, clicks should target the map [401] near labeled places north of Forbes Avenue (e.g., “Union Grill,” “Orient Express,” “Starbucks”), or zoom in/out to refine targeting.

The user wants restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab. I’m on the OpenStreetMap Query Features page with the map centered on CMU ArtPark Lab. Clicking the map container [401] queries features at the center, which returned only the park. To surface restaurants such as Union Grill, Orient Express, or Starbucks, I need to query slightly north and west of the lab (across Forbes Avenue) where those labels appear. Since clicking image tiles doesn’t work and the environment doesn’t support drag, I can pan the map using arrow keys. The map container [401] is already focused (the accessibility tree shows the map generic element focused), so pressing ArrowUp should move the center north toward the restaurant area. After panning, I can click the map again to query features at the new center and identify restaurants. The best next single action is to press ArrowUp to begin panning toward the area with restaurants.

The user wants restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab. We’re on OpenStreetMap’s Query Features page with the query tool enabled.

Since clicking the map container [401] always clicks the center, I need to pan the map so the center lies over the cluster of restaurants north of the park.

✅ Current Progress:
- Located “CMU ArtPark Lab, Pittsburgh, PA” via search and opened the result.
- Enabled “Query features” mode.
- Panned and clicked on the map; the “Nearby features” list is populated (roads/parking/building), but no restaurants have been captured yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- On-track: Yes. The OpenStreetMap “Query Features” view is appropriate for finding nearby restaurants.
- Relevant interactive elements and states:
  - [401] Map container — focused and clickable; clicking queries the map center. Supports arrow-key panning.
  - [434] “Zoom In” link — visible/enabled.
  - [436] “Zoom Out” link — visible/enabled.
  - [454] “Query features” link — active (panel with instructions is visible).
  - [162] “Search” textbox — filled with “CMU ArtPark Lab, Pittsburgh, PA”; [165] “Go” button — available but not needed further.
  - “Nearby features” panel [730]/[735] — currently lists:
    - Service Road “Flossie Way” (link present)
    - Parking “#313330278” (link present)
    - Service Road “#945363989” (link present)
    - University Building “TCS Hall” (link present)
    - Footpath “#1267200353” (link present)
- Interpretation: The last query point is centered around Flossie Way/TCS Hall, not directly over the restaurant POIs visible on the map (e.g., Lucca Ristorante, Union Grill, Orient Express, Starbucks). Panning slightly toward those labels (northwest of the current center near Forbes Ave/S Craig St) and clicking again should surface restaurant entries in “Nearby features.”

The user's goal is to find restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab using the OpenStreetMap Query Features tool. The map is centered near TCS Hall and Flossie Way, as indicated by the current “Nearby features” list (Service Road Flossie Way, Parking, TCS Hall, Footpath). Visible restaurant labels (Union Grill, Orient Express, Starbucks, Lucca Ristorante) are to the west/northwest of the current center (around South Craig Street and Forbes Avenue). Since clicking the map container [401] queries only the map center, I need to pan the center toward that restaurant cluster. The map container is focused, so arrow keys can pan. Pressing ArrowLeft will shift the center west toward Union Grill/Orient Express/Starbucks, after which I can click to query and surface those POIs.

Objective: Find restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab using the current OpenStreetMap “Query Features” tool.

Current state:
- We are on the OSM Query Features page centered near CMU ArtPark Lab.
- Query mode is active; the left panel instructs “Click on the map to find nearby features” and shows a “Nearby features” list.
- The current nearby features list shows Flossie Way, Parking, TCS Hall, and a Footpath — indicating the query point is still to the east/southeast of the restaurant cluster.
- The screenshot shows several restaurant POIs west/northwest along South Craig Street and Forbes Avenue: Union Grill, Orient Express, Starbucks, Subway, Lucca Ristorante, Rose Tea Cafe.

Recent actions:
- Clicking the map container [401] timed out (element not stable). Repeating the same click immediately is discouraged.
- Arrow key panning has worked previously to reposition the map center before querying.

Plan:
- Pan the map center west toward South Craig Street where the restaurants are concentrated (Union Grill/Orient Express/Starbucks visible).
- After panning, I will click the map to refresh the Nearby features list to include those restaurants.

Rationale for next action:
- Using ArrowLeft on the focused map container [401] will shift the center toward the visible restaurant cluster, setting up the next query click.
- This avoids repeating the action that just timed out (click on [401]) and progresses toward surfacing restaurant POIs.

Goal: List restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab using the OpenStreetMap Query Features tool.

Current state: We’re on the Query Features panel with the map centered near CMU ArtPark Lab. Restaurant POIs (Union Grill, Orient Express, Starbucks, Lucca Ristorante, Subway, Rose Tea Cafe) are visible to the west/northwest around South Craig Street and Forbes Avenue. I’ve already panned the map west (ArrowLeft) to move the center toward that restaurant cluster. To surface the specific POIs, I need to query at the current map center by clicking the map container, which updates the “Nearby features” list in the left panel. The last step was a pan, so the appropriate follow-up is to click the map to get the refreshed list, which should now include restaurants.

The user wants restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab. I'm on OpenStreetMap’s “Query Features” view with the query tool active.

The visible map shows multiple restaurants along South Craig Street and Forbes Avenue (Union Grill, Orient Express, Starbucks, Subway, Rose Tea Cafe, Lucca Ristorante). I have panned north and west using arrow keys to bring the map center closer to that cluster. After the most recent action (ArrowLeft), I haven’t queried again, so the “Nearby features” list still reflects the previous center (Flossie Way/TCS Hall). To surface restaurants, I should click the map container [401] to query the current center position. This should update the “Nearby features” list with nearby POIs, likely including restaurants.

✅ Current Progress:
- Located “CMU ArtPark Lab, Pittsburgh, PA” on OpenStreetMap.
- Enabled “Query features” mode.
- Panned and queried multiple times; current results show general nearby map features but no restaurants yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- On the critical path. The “Query Features” tool is appropriate for identifying nearby restaurants.
- Visual context shows several restaurant POIs just west/northwest of the lab around South Craig Street and Forbes Avenue (e.g., Union Grill, Orient Express, Starbucks, Subway, Rose Tea Cafe, Lucca Ristorante). The current query center appears slightly east (near Zebina Way/Flossie Way), so restaurant POIs aren’t included in the results yet.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - [401] Map container (“Zoom In … Query features …”): focused/visible; accepts clicks to query the map center; arrow keys pan the map.
  - [454] “Query features” link: visible and active (panel says “Click on the map to find nearby features.”).
  - [822] “Nearby features” heading with [827] list: visible; currently lists non-restaurant items (e.g., “University Building — Carnegie Mellon University,” “Building — 411 South Craig Street,” “Service Road — Zebina Way,” “Service Road — Flossie Way,” “Parking — #313330278,” “Steps — #324870337,” “Retail Area — #924423038,” “University — Carnegie Mellon University”).
  - [434]/[436] “Zoom In”/“Zoom Out” links: visible/enabled (optional for adjusting view).
  - [162] Search textbox (filled with “CMU ArtPark Lab, Pittsburgh, PA”) and [165] “Go” button: visible/enabled but not needed further.

The user wants restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab. I’m on OpenStreetMap’s Query Features page with the “Query features” tool active. The current “Nearby features” list shows general items like a university building and service roads, which suggests the query point is still centered slightly east of the visible restaurant cluster. The map shows multiple restaurant POIs along South Craig Street and Forbes Avenue (Union Grill, Orient Express, Starbucks, Subway, Rose Tea Cafe, Lucca Ristorante) to the west/northwest of the current center. Since clicking the map container queries the center point, I need to pan the center toward that cluster first. The map container [401] is focused, so arrow keys can pan. The most effective immediate move is to pan left (west) toward South Craig Street, then I can click to query in the next step.
