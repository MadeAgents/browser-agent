The user wants to know who has the most commits to the thoughtbot/administrate project. On GitLab, the Contributors tab within a repository shows contributors and their number of commits. To reach that project efficiently, I should use the instance’s search since scrolling through projects would be slow. The instructions warn that the global search bar is not working, and provide a specific search URL pattern to use: http://10.177.37.113:8023/search?search=<repository-name>&nav_source=navbar. Therefore, the next best step is to navigate directly to the search results for "administrate" (without the group prefix), then I can click into the thoughtbot/administrate repo and proceed to the Contributors tab. I will first go to the search results page for "administrate".

The user's goal is to identify who has the most commits to the thoughtbot/administrate project. I navigated to the repository’s Contributors page, which shows contributors with their commit counts for the main branch and states “Excluding merge commits. Limited to 6,000 commits.” Scanning the list, the top entry is “Grayson Wright” with “200 commits (wright.grayson@gmail.com)”. Other high counts include “dependabot-preview[bot]” with 190 and “Nick Charlton” with 170, but none exceed 200 in individual entries. There are duplicate entries for some contributors under different emails, but even if summed (e.g., Nick Charlton 170 + 12 = 182), they still don’t surpass 200. Therefore, the correct answer is Grayson Wright with 200 commits. I will send this concise result to the user.
