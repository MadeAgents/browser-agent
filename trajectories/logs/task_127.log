The user asks which brands appear most frequently among the top search terms. On the Magento Admin Dashboard, there is a "Top Search Terms" table listing search terms and their "Uses." The entries are:
- hollister — Uses: 19
- Joust Bag — Uses: 4
- Antonia Racer Tank — Uses: 2
- tanks — Uses: 1
- WP10 — Uses: 1

Among these, the clear brand name is "hollister" (others are product names or generic terms). Therefore, the brand that appears most frequently among the top search terms is "hollister" with 19 uses.
