The goal is to like (upvote) all submissions created by the user Don_Gato1 in the New York forum. I’m currently on the /f/nyc forum page, which lists submissions and includes a search box labeled “Search query” [57]. Scrolling isn’t supported and the visible posts don’t include Don_Gato1. Using the forum’s search is the most efficient way to locate that user’s submissions within this forum, matching the general tips to leverage search instead of browsing manually. Since I’m unsure of special filter syntax, entering the exact username string “Don_Gato1” should match the “Submitted by” text of relevant posts. The next step is to fill the search box with “Don_Gato1”; after that, I can submit/press Enter to run the search.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the user profile for “Don_Gato1” and clicked the Upvote button on the visible nyc submission (“Fox News Hosts Cast New York as Crime-Ridden…”) [350].

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page (user profile for “Don_Gato1”) is on the critical path. It shows mixed content under “Overview.”
- Relevant navigation:
  - “Submissions” [113] link (visible/enabled) — will list all submissions by the user.
  - “Overview” [111], “Comments” [115].
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Submission card “AI experts disown Musk-backed campaign…” with forum link “technology” [131] and Upvote button [142] (enabled) — not part of the goal since it’s not in nyc.
  - The nyc submission “Fox News Hosts Cast New York as Crime-Ridden…” shows an Upvote button [350] (clicked). Comments/vote controls on replies (e.g., Upvote [197]) are present but irrelevant to the goal.
- To progress toward the goal, use “Submissions” [113] to view all of Don_Gato1’s submissions and Upvote only those whose forum link indicates “nyc” (New York).
