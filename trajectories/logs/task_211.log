The user wants the customer name and email associated with a specific phone number (8015551212). In Magento Admin, the most direct way is to use the Customers grid (Customers > All Customers) and filter by the Phone/Telephone column. From the Dashboard, I should navigate to the CUSTOMERS section first. Once on the Customers page, I can apply a filter on the phone column with the provided number to find the matching record. Therefore, the next best action is to click the "CUSTOMERS" menu link to open the customers grid.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the CUSTOMERS menu from the Magento Admin Dashboard; the Customers submenu is visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is the Dashboard with the CUSTOMERS submenu expanded—this is on the path toward the goal, but not yet at the customer list. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link “All Customers” (id: 214) — visible, enabled. This is the primary path to access the customer grid and apply filters (e.g., by phone).
- Links “Now Online” (id: 217), “Login as Customer Log” (id: 220), “Customer Groups” (id: 223) — visible, enabled, but not relevant for finding a customer by phone.
- Top search textbox (id: 679) — visible, empty; global search and not specific to customer filters.

The goal is to find the customer name and email associated with the phone number 8015551212. In Magento Admin, the most appropriate way is to navigate to Customers > All Customers, then use the filters to search by the Phone column. Currently, the CUSTOMERS submenu is expanded on the Dashboard, and I see the "All Customers" link (bid 214). The next step is to click "All Customers" to open the customers grid where I can apply the phone filter.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the Customers list in Magento Admin; the customer grid is visible with 70 records. No filtering by phone has been applied yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal since it shows the full customer grid with Name, Email, and Phone columns.
- Button “Filters” (id: 859) — visible, enabled; required to filter specifically by the Phone column.
- Textbox “Search by keyword” (id: 854) — visible, empty; general search, may be less precise for phone matches.
- Button “Search” (id: 855) — visible, enabled.
- Table columns: “Name” (id: 1606), “Email” (id: 1608), “Phone” (id: 1612) — visible; rows currently unfiltered.
- Other controls (e.g., “Add New Customer” id: 716, “Export” id: 839) are not relevant to the goal.
No row with phone number 8015551212 is immediately visible; applying a Phone filter is necessary to locate the matching customer.

The user wants the customer name and email for phone number 8015551212. I am already on the Customers grid page in Magento Admin, which lists Name, Email, and Phone columns. Scanning the visible rows in the table, I find a row where the Phone column shows 8015551212. The corresponding Name is "Sean Miller" and the Email is "sean.miller@gmail.com". Since the information is already visible and unambiguous, the next step is to relay this information back to the user succinctly using send_msg_to_user.
