The user wants to check merge requests assigned to them. On the current GitLab dashboard page, the top navigation bar includes a direct "Merge requests" link (node [157]). Clicking this is the most straightforward way to access the merge requests section, where there are usually tabs/filters like "Assigned to me." I will click the "Merge requests" link to proceed to that page.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the top navigation “Merge requests” menu; the submenu is visible with an “Assigned to you (3)” option.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the GitLab dashboard (Projects list), but the “Merge requests” menu in the header is expanded, which is on the critical path to viewing merge requests assigned to you.
- link [157] “Merge requests” — expanded=True, visible, focusable.
- link [165] “Assigned to you 3” — visible, enabled; this is the primary action to reach your assigned merge requests.
- link [168] “Review requests for you 5” — visible, enabled; secondary filter not required for the stated goal.
The main content shows project listings and is not directly relevant to the goal.

The user's goal is to view merge requests assigned to them. On the current GitLab dashboard, the top navigation "Merge requests" menu is already expanded, showing submenu items including "Assigned to you 3" (bid 165). To directly navigate to the list of merge requests assigned to the user, the best next step is to click the "Assigned to you 3" link. This will filter merge requests specifically to those assigned to the logged-in user (byteblaze) and fulfills the goal efficiently without needing to scroll or search further.
