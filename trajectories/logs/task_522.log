The goal is to fork all repositories from the "facebook" namespace on this GitLab instance. Starting from the Projects dashboard, the most efficient way to locate repositories is to use the site’s dedicated search URL (the global search bar is noted as not working). According to the tips, I should navigate directly to the GitLab search page with the query "facebook" to find repositories under that group or with that term. Once I see the results, I can identify the "facebook" group and its repositories and begin forking them one by one. The first step is to go to the search results page for "facebook".

The objective is to fork all repositories under the “facebook” namespace. I’m currently on the fork form for Meta/create-react-app. The form shows the destination namespace set to my account (button displays “byteblaze”), the visibility is set to Public, and required fields are filled. However, the “Fork project” button is disabled and an error banner previously indicated a fork failure. In GitLab, a disabled submit button often means a validation issue—commonly that the project slug already exists in my namespace. I updated the slug once to “create-react-app-fork,” but the button remains disabled, suggesting that slug likely still conflicts. To resolve this, I should make the slug more unique (e.g., include my username) to avoid any existing paths in my namespace and re-trigger validation. The slug textbox [577] is focused and currently set to “create-react-app-fork,” so I will change it to a more unique value, such as “create-react-app-byteblaze,” which should help enable the fork button.

The goal is to fork all repositories under the "facebook" namespace. I’m currently on the fork page for Meta/create-react-app. The form shows:
- Namespace: byteblaze (selected).
- Project name: create-react-app.
- Project slug: create-react-app-byteblaze.
- Visibility: Public.

However, the "Fork project" button [614] remains disabled, which typically indicates a validation issue, most often that the project slug already exists in my namespace. I previously changed the slug a couple of times, but the button is still disabled. To try to resolve this, I will update the slug to an even more unique value to ensure there is no collision. If this clears validation, the button should enable, allowing me to proceed with the fork. The slug field is [577], so I’ll input a new unique slug.

The user’s goal is to fork all repos from the facebook namespace. I’m currently on the “Fork project · Meta / create-react-app” form. The destination namespace is set to “byteblaze,” visibility is Public, and both required fields (Project name and Project slug) are filled. However, the “Fork project” button remains disabled, indicating a validation issue still exists.

- Located the “Meta @facebook” account and opened the “create-react-app” repository.
- Initiated the fork flow and selected the destination namespace (“byteblaze”).
- Updated required fields: Project name [508] and Project slug [577] both set to “create-react-app-byteblaze-2”.
- Prior error banner was dismissed; the fork has not been submitted yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (“Fork project · Meta / create-react-app · GitLab”) is directly on the critical path to the goal of forking repositories from the facebook namespace.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Textbox “Project name” [508] — required, visible, focused, filled (“create-react-app-byteblaze-2”).
  - Textbox “Project slug” [577] — required, visible, filled (“create-react-app-byteblaze-2”).
  - Namespace selector button [518] — visible, hasPopup=menu, expanded=False, labeled “byteblaze” (destination is set).
- The form appears configured for a fork; the submit control (“Fork project” button) isn’t shown in the provided axtree, so its current enabled/disabled state is unknown. No off-track indicators detected.

The user’s goal is to fork all repositories from the facebook namespace. I’m currently on the “Fork project · Meta / create-react-app” page, but the “Fork project” button remains disabled despite multiple attempts to adjust the project slug and name. This strongly suggests a constraint such as an existing fork in my namespace preventing another fork, which is common behavior in GitLab (you generally can’t fork the same source project into the same namespace more than once). Rather than continuing futile adjustments, I should proceed to fork the other repository (“buck”) under Meta @facebook. The quickest way to get back to the Meta profile page (where “buck” is listed) is to use the breadcrumbs and click “Meta.” From there, I can select the “buck” repository and attempt to fork it.

✅ Current Progress:
- Located the “Meta @facebook” account and viewed its repositories.
- Opened “Meta / create-react-app” and entered the fork flow; selected destination namespace “byteblaze” and attempted various name/slug adjustments.
- Returned to the Meta profile page via breadcrumb “Meta” [484]. No repositories have been successfully forked yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (“Meta · GitLab” user profile) is on the critical path to the goal of forking facebook’s repositories.
- Relevant interactive elements on this page:
  - Link “Personal projects” [282] — visible/enabled; leads to the full list of repositories under this account.
  - Link “Contributed projects” [280] — visible/enabled; may show projects the account has contributed to.
  - Navigation tabs: “Overview” [274], “Activity” [276] — visible/enabled; less directly relevant.
  - Button “Follow” [240] — visible/enabled; not required for forking.
- The screenshot shows at least two personal projects (“create-react-app” and “buck”) listed and clickable. Forking actions are performed on each project’s page.

The objective is to fork all repositories under the "facebook" (Meta) namespace. I’m currently on the Meta user profile page, which lists personal projects. I can see two repositories: “create-react-app” and “buck.” I already attempted to fork “create-react-app” but encountered a persistently disabled “Fork project” button, likely due to an existing fork or validation conflict. To continue progress toward the goal, I should proceed to fork the other visible repository, “buck.” The most efficient next step is to navigate to the “buck” project page by clicking its link, where I can look for and use the Fork action.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (“Meta / buck · GitLab”) is directly on the critical path toward the goal of forking facebook’s repositories.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link “Fork” [591] — visible and enabled; initiates the forking process for this repository.
  - Link “Meta” in Breadcrumbs [499] — visible; useful to return to the account page to access other repos after forking.
  - Link “Request Access” [523] — visible; not required for forking public projects.
  - Alert “You can't push or pull… add an SSH key” [486] with “Dismiss” [484] — visible; informational, does not block forking.
- The page shows this is a public project (“buck Public”) and includes standard project navigation; the key next action is the “Fork” link.

  - Textbox “Project name” [503] — required, filled with “buck”, visible/editable.
  - Button “Select a namespace” [513] — hasPopup=menu, expanded=False, visible; destination namespace must be chosen (e.g., your user).
  - Textbox “Project slug” [572] — required, filled with “buck”, visible/editable.
  - Link “Create a group” [574] — visible; optional, not needed for forking.
  - Breadcrumb links: “Meta” [479], “buck” [482], “Fork project” [486] — visible; useful for navigation.
- Selecting a valid destination namespace and ensuring a unique project slug are typically required before the “Fork project” submit becomes available. No indication of error on this form yet.

- Attempted to fork “create-react-app,” but the submit button remained disabled.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page shows only “RootWebArea '', focused” with a blank screenshot, indicating no visible content or interactive elements. This page is not on the critical path toward the goal, and it’s unclear whether the “buck” fork succeeded.
- No relevant interactive elements are present in the current axtree (no buttons, links, or inputs visible), so progress cannot be made from this state.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Page appears blank/unrelated—use the browser Back to return to the previous fork page or the “Meta / buck” project page, then verify whether the fork redirected to your namespace (“byteblaze”).
- If the page remains blank, try a browser Reload to recover the page and re-attempt navigation to the Meta profile to continue forking remaining repositories.
