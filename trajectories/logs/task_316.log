The user asks for the top 3 contributors (by commits) to "facebook's guide on building react apps" repo in this GitLab instance. To find this, I should locate the specific repository, open its "Contributors" tab under Repository, and read the names and commit counts, ranking them. The current page is the Projects dashboard; using tips, the global search bar is not working, but the provided search URL is recommended. Since I don't know the exact repository name, the most efficient approach is to search for "facebook" to list repos related to Facebook, then identify the repository that matches "guide on building react apps". After that, I will navigate to the repository and its Contributors tab. Therefore, the next best action is to navigate to the search page with the query "facebook".

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the GitLab global Search page and executed a search for “facebook”. The “Projects” category shows 0 results.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is relevant to the goal (finding the specific repository and then its contributors). Key interactive elements:
- Search input [227] labeled “Search for projects, issues, etc.” — current value: “facebook”, enabled and editable.
- “Search” button [231] — enabled and visible.
- “Clear” button [228] — enabled and visible.
- Filters: “Group” dropdown [236] (set to “Any”, closed), “Project” dropdown [259] (set to “Any”, closed).
- Result category links: “Projects 0” [285] (no project results), “Issues 99” [289] (link available), “Merge requests 99” [294] (link available), “Users 1” [303] (link available).
The page reports “We couldn’t find any projects matching facebook”. To proceed toward the goal, a more targeted query (e.g., including “guide on building react apps” or “react”) will likely be needed to locate the correct repository before accessing its contributors list.

Goal: Find the top 3 contributors (by commits) to "facebook's guide on building react apps" repo on this GitLab instance, then list their names ranked by commit count.

Analysis:
- The search results for "facebook" show 0 projects; the repo may not include "facebook" in its name. The likely project name is "create-react-app" (Facebook’s guide/tool for building React apps).
- As per tips, I should use the search URL directly instead of the global search bar. I’ll search for "create-react-app" to locate the repository.
Plan:
1) Navigate to the search URL with query "create-react-app".
2) If the project is found, open it.
3) Go to Repository > Contributors tab to get the top contributors and their commit counts.

Next best action: Navigate to the search page with "create-react-app".
