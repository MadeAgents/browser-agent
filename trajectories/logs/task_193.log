The user's goal is to get the total payment amount of the last 2 completed orders. To achieve this, I should navigate to the Orders list where I can filter by order status (Completed), sort by Purchase Date in descending order (as required by the task tips), identify the last two completed orders, and sum their payment amounts (likely the "Grand Total" or "Total Paid" values). 

From the current Magento Admin dashboard, the top navigation bar contains a "SALES" link (bid 156). The first step is to click SALES to access the Sales section, typically leading to the Orders grid or revealing the Orders option. This is the logical first action; further steps will involve filtering by status, sorting by Purchase Date descending, and then extracting totals and calculating their sum using the calculate() function.

I will start by clicking the SALES menu item.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly relevant to the goal. However, the pagination indicates the view is on page 2 of 2 (older orders), so the newest orders are not currently visible. No status filter is applied yet, so “Completed” orders are not isolated.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Filters button (id/text: ‘\ue605Filters’, node [845]) — visible/enabled, currently closed.
  - Pagination:
    - Left arrow button (node [1123]) — enabled (to go to previous page, likely page 1).

The goal is to get the total payment amount of the last 2 completed orders. We are on the Orders grid, which shows many orders with their Status and Grand Total columns.

The task is to get the total payment amount of the last 2 completed orders. I’m on the Orders grid and have already explicitly sorted by Purchase Date descending to satisfy the benchmark rule. Scanning the most recent section of the list (near the bottom of the current page content because the rows appear in ascending order in the tree even though the header shows descending), the two most recent orders with Status "Complete" are:

- 000000217 (Dec 1, 2022) with Grand Total (Purchased) $121.00 and Status "Complete"
- 000000201 (Nov 20, 2022) with Grand Total (Purchased) $176.10 and Status "Complete"

There are no "Complete" orders between Nov 20 and Dec 1, and entries after Dec 1 don’t exist in this dataset, so these are the latest two completed orders.

Per rule 12, I must use the calculate() function for arithmetic, so I will compute 121.00 + 176.10 to obtain the total payment amount.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the Filters button [845] to open filters, then set Status to “Complete” and apply the filter. After filtering, read the first two rows (top of the grid with “↓ Purchase Date” [1380]) where the “Status” column [1390] shows “Complete”, take their “Grand Total (Purchased)” values [1388], and compute the sum using calculate().

The user needs the total payment amount of the last 2 completed orders. I’m currently on the Orders grid page with “Purchase Date” explicitly sorted in descending order (↓), which satisfies the requirement to sort by purchase date. To accurately identify the last two completed orders, it’s best to filter the grid by Status = Complete and then read the first two entries’ “Grand Total (Purchased)” values. The next step is to open the Filters panel to set Status to Complete. I see a Filters button [845] labeled “\ue605Filters” at the top of the grid. I will click it to open the filter options.

The task is to obtain the total payment amount of the last 2 completed orders. I’m on the Orders grid and have already performed the required sort by Purchase Date in descending order. To isolate only completed orders and easily pick the most recent two, I should apply a filter for Status = Complete in the Filters panel that’s currently visible. In the accessibility tree, the Status filter is a combobox with bid 967, and it includes an option labeled "Complete". The next step is to set this Status filter to "Complete" so that I can then apply filters and read the amounts from the first two rows in the sorted list.

Goal: Get the total payment amount of the last 2 completed orders.

Current page: Magento Admin > Sales > Orders grid. The Filters panel is open, and the Status combobox is already set to "Complete" (value shows Complete). Per Task Tip #11, I already performed an explicit sort by Purchase Date to descending by clicking the "Purchase Date" column header, ensuring the "↓" indicator is present. Now I need the grid to reflect the "Complete" status filter, so clicking "Apply Filters" will update the results to only completed orders. Once filtered, the most recent two completed orders will be at the top (due to descending sort), and I can extract their "Grand Total (Purchased)" to calculate the sum. I previously calculated a candidate sum (121.00 + 176.10 = 297.10) based on visible rows, but to follow the correct workflow, I should first apply the filter. Next action: click the "Apply Filters" button.
