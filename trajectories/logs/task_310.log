The user wants to know who has made the most commits to the AndroidSlidingUpPanel project. To find this, I should open the project's page and navigate to the Contributors tab, which lists contributors and their number of commits. From the current dashboard page, the fastest way to locate the repository is to use the provided direct search URL rather than the global search bar, as per tip #13.

The user needs to know which contributor has the highest number of commits in the AndroidSlidingUpPanel project.

I am currently on the GitLab search results page where the project “Umano: News Read To You / AndroidSlidingUpPanel” is listed. The next logical action is to click the project link to open its repository page, from which I can navigate to the Contributors view.

  - Link: “Repository” (id: [291]) — visible and clickable; leads to repository views where a “Contributors” tab is typically available.
  - Link: “361 Commits” (id: [594]) — visible and clickable; opens commit history, from which the “Contributors” tab is usually accessible.
  - Link: “Analytics” (id: [421]) — visible and clickable; may include contributor analytics depending on project configuration.
- The project is public (“AndroidSlidingUpPanel Public”), so no login barrier is present. No errors detected; navigation is on track.

The goal is to identify who has made the most commits to the AndroidSlidingUpPanel project. On GitLab, this information is typically found under the Repository section’s "Contributors" view, which lists contributors and their commit counts.

I’m currently on the project’s main page, with the left sidebar showing "Repository" as a navigable item (bid [291]). Clicking "Repository" should either navigate to the repository overview or expand its submenu to reveal sub-options like "Commits", "Branches", and "Contributors". Since I need the "Contributors" page, the next logical step is to click "Repository" to access or reveal the sub-navigation where "Contributors" will likely be available. After that, I can click "Contributors" to view the list and determine who has the most commits.

Given the instruction not to scroll and to use navigation instead, clicking the "Repository" link is the appropriate next step to reach the Contributors view.

🔍 Current State Analysis:

  - Branch selector button “master” (id [494]) — visible/enabled; the charts are scoped to this branch.
  - Heading “Commits to master” (id [514]) — confirms current scope; merge commits excluded.
  - “History” link (id [511]) — available but not required for aggregate contributor counts.
  - Contributor cards — multiple visible panels, each labeled with a contributor’s name and a small bar chart of commits over time; the axtree is truncated so individual ids aren’t listed, but the cards are visible on the page. Typically these are ordered by total commits, so the first card should correspond to the top contributor.
- No errors or off-track indicators detected; the page content is relevant to the goal.
