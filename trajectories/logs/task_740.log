The user wants directions between two points: Carnegie Mellon University (in Pittsburgh, PA) and the home stadium of NYC’s NBA team (Madison Square Garden). On the OpenStreetMap page, the most efficient way is to open the directions panel rather than searching each location separately. I see a link labeled “Find directions between two points” near the search and Go buttons (bid 167). Clicking this should open the directions interface with fields for the start and end points, where I can then input the two locations. This aligns with the task tips, which recommend using the dedicated directions tool instead of manual scrolling.

The user wants directions from Carnegie Mellon University to the home stadium of NYC’s NBA team. On the current OpenStreetMap directions page, I see the directions interface with two textboxes: “From” [194] and “To” [199], and travel mode set to Car. To start generating a route, I should first fill the “From” field with a precise origin. Providing “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” will help the map pinpoint the correct campus in Pittsburgh. After this, I will fill the “To” field with the destination (likely Madison Square Garden, New York, NY) and then trigger the route calculation (usually by pressing Enter in the “To” field). Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best single action is to fill the “From” field.
