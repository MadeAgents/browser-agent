The user wants the path and travel time between the homes of the 1980 and 1991 Super Bowl champions. Based on the task tips, the hint about looking up locations in Pittsburgh, PA suggests the 1980 champions are the Pittsburgh Steelers (Super Bowl XIV held in January 1980). For the 1991 champions, common interpretation is the team that won the Super Bowl held in 1991, which is the New York Giants (Super Bowl XXV in January 1991). To compute a route on OpenStreetMap, I should use the directions feature. The current page shows the "Find directions between two points" link (bid 167) near the Go button. The best next step is to click that to open the route planner panel with From/To fields, then in subsequent steps enter "Pittsburgh, PA" and "New York, NY" and compute the route to get the travel time. I'll start by clicking the directions link.
