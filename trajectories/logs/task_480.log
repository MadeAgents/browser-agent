The goal is to invite "yjlou" as a collaborator to the "solarized-prism-theme" project. I am on the Project members page with the "Invite members" modal open. The username "yjlou" has been entered and the suggested account was selected, as indicated by the listbox showing "avatar yjlou". The role dropdown (combobox) is currently set to "Guest". Since "collaborator" typically implies the ability to contribute code, setting the role to "Developer" is appropriate before sending the invite. To change the role, I need to open the role combobox to reveal its options, and then I can select "Developer" in a subsequent step. Therefore, the next best single action is to click the role combobox (bid 940) to open it.

Since collaborator typically means someone who can contribute code, "Developer" is the appropriate role.

The username "yjlou" is already selected in the invite field (listbox shows the selected option). The role combobox is currently set to "Guest". In my last attempt, I tried clicking the "Developer" option (bid 943), but it failed because the option was not visible—the combobox likely wasn't expanded. To avoid visibility issues and ensure the role is changed correctly, I will use the select_option action on the role combobox (bid 940) to directly set it to "Developer". After this, the next step will be clicking the "Invite" button to send the invitation.
