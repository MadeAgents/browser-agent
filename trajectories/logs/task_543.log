The user wants to update the product description of "Bella Tank" to include quotes from positive user reviews. To do this properly, I need to first locate and read the real user reviews for Bella Tank to extract positive comments, then edit the product description in the product catalog. The best way to find user reviews is via the MARKETING menu, specifically under User Content > All Reviews. From the current Dashboard page, the top menubar shows the "MARKETING" link. My immediate next step is to click MARKETING to navigate to the marketing section where I can access All Reviews.

The user asked to update the product description of “Bella Tank” to highlight real user positive reviews by quoting the comments. I’m currently on the Bella Tank product edit page with the Content section open, and “Edit with Page Builder” was clicked, so the Page Builder canvas and left palette are visible. To add the quote to the Description, I need an editable field. However, Page Builder editing often requires hovering and clicking a gear icon or dragging a “Text” block onto the stage—both are hard to control precisely here. A more reliable approach is to exit Page Builder mode and fall back to the standard Description editor (WYSIWYG or textarea), which is straightforward to edit.

I see the “Edit with Page Builder” button [3846] which likely toggles the Page Builder view. Clicking it again should close the Page Builder interface and expose the normal Description field for direct editing. Once that’s available, I can insert the quote from the review we saw earlier (“Good choice for working out and stylin' enough to wear when I'm hanging with friends on hot days. Also washes really well!” — Elfriede) into the description and then save.

Therefore, the next best action is to click the “Edit with Page Builder” button again to exit the builder and get to an editable Description field.

Clicking it again should close the Page Builder interface and expose the normal Description field for direct editing. Once that’s available, I can insert the quote from the review we saw earlier (“Good choice for working out and stylin' enough to wear when I'm hanging with friends on hot days. Also washes really well!” — Elfriede) into the description and then save.

Therefore, the next best action is to click the “Edit with Page Builder” button again to exit the builder and get to an editable Description field.

Task: Update the Bella Tank product Description to highlight positive user reviews by quoting comments. I’m on the product edit page (Bella Tank) with the Content section open and Page Builder active. The description content is visible in Page Builder. My last attempt to click “Edit with Page Builder” again to exit was blocked by a Page Builder overlay (bid=3971) intercepting the click. To proceed, I need a way to either:
- Access an editable field within Page Builder, or
- Toggle Page Builder controls to present an editor/modal, or
- Close/minimize the overlay/panel so I can interact with the description toggle.

Within the Content section, just after the “Edit with Page Builder” button, there are two unlabeled buttons: [4004] (disabled) and [4013] (enabled). These likely correspond to Page Builder control buttons such as “Full Screen,” “Toggle panel,” “Close,” or “Actions” that can change the editing state. Since [4013] is enabled and nearby, clicking it is a reasonable next step to adjust the builder UI so I can edit or exit Page Builder and then inject the quote. I’ll click the enabled unlabeled button [4013] to try to expose an editable interface or free the overlay so that I can then edit the description and add the quotes.

Goal: Update Bella Tank product description to include quotes from positive user reviews. I’m on the Bella Tank product edit page, with the Content section expanded. The Description currently shows the Page Builder UI, including the left palette and a canvas displaying the existing HTML content as static text, which indicates Page Builder mode is active. Editing within Page Builder may require drag-and-drop or clicking on the stage to open a modal, which can be unreliable here. A more reliable path is to toggle off Page Builder to return to the standard Description editor where I can directly edit the HTML/text.

The “Edit with Page Builder” button (bid 3846) typically toggles the mode. I previously attempted interacting with another Page Builder control, but it didn’t yield an editable field. Therefore, the best next action is to click “Edit with Page Builder” again to exit Page Builder and reveal a standard editor field for the Description, after which I can insert the review quote(s) and save.

Objective: Update the Bella Tank product Description to include quotes from real positive user reviews. I’m on the Bella Tank product edit page, inside the Content section, with Page Builder active for the Description. The canvas and left palette are visible, and the current description HTML is shown as static text, meaning I need to enter an editing mode for the Page Builder content block or switch to a simpler editor.

Attempts so far:
- Clicking “Edit with Page Builder” didn’t exit/toggle to a simple editor.
- Clicking the stage overlay didn’t bring up an editor for the text block.
- Another nearby Page Builder control button [4013] is disabled. There is a second nearby, unlabeled button [4004] that appears enabled. These unlabeled buttons are typical Page Builder controls (e.g., toggle panel, fullscreen, preview), and interacting with them can change the UI state to reveal edit controls or a mode where editing is possible.

Plan:
- Click the enabled unlabeled button [4004] to adjust the Page Builder UI (potentially toggle fullscreen or preview/panel), which often exposes the content block’s edit handles/gear icon or makes the stage interactive. This is a new action (not repeated) and may enable me to edit the Description content. Once I can edit, I will insert a quote(s) from the positive reviews and then save.

Objective: Update the Bella Tank product Description to include quotes from real positive user reviews. I am on the Bella Tank product edit page with the Content section open and Page Builder active. The current description content is visible on the Page Builder canvas as static text.

Previous clicks on the stage and Page Builder buttons did not expose an editable field.

I’m on the Bella Tank product edit page with the Content section open, and the Description is currently managed via Page Builder. The Page Builder canvas shows the existing HTML as static text, indicating the content is an HTML Code block on the stage. Prior attempts to click the “Edit with Page Builder” button and the overlay didn’t open an editable interface, and adding content via drag-and-drop is not feasible here. A common way to enter edit mode within Page Builder is to select the block and press Enter, which can trigger the edit dialog for the selected block. I previously hovered and clicked on the stage overlay (bid 3960) without success; pressing Enter on this stage element is a different interaction that may invoke the block edit mode. To progress toward editing and inserting quotes, I will try pressing Enter on the stage overlay element to open the edit interface for the block.

The user wants me to update the Bella Tank product description by quoting positive reviews. I’m on the Bella Tank edit page with the Content section open, and the Description is being managed via Page Builder. The Page Builder canvas shows the current HTML as static content, but I haven’t been able to enter an editor to modify it. I tried toggling Page Builder and interacting with the stage overlay without success.

Given Page Builder typically allows editing by selecting the content block on the canvas (which brings up edit controls), the best next step is to click directly on the content area shown on the canvas (as indicated by the SOM overlay). The SOM shows a clickable region (id 76) over the description text area. Clicking this should select the block and ideally display the inline toolbar/gear icon to edit the content, enabling me to insert the review quote. This is a new action targeting the content itself, different from prior attempts that clicked the overlay/container or unrelated controls.

The goal is to update the Bella Tank product description to include quotes from real positive reviews. I’m on the Bella Tank product edit page with the Content section expanded. The Long Description is currently managed via Page Builder, and multiple attempts to enter an editable mode within Page Builder (clicking the canvas/overlay, toggling the Page Builder button, using nearby controls) have not yielded an editor or modal to modify the content. To make progress and still satisfy the intent of highlighting reviews on the product page, I can update the Short Description, which is directly editable via a WYSIWYG/TinyMCE and can be toggled to a plain textarea using “Show / Hide Editor.” Once toggled, I can input the review quote(s) and later save. Therefore, the next best action is to click “Show / Hide Editor” for the Short Description to switch it to a standard textarea, enabling me to insert the quotes in subsequent steps.

The task is to update the Bella Tank product description to include quotes from positive user reviews. I’m on the Bella Tank product edit page with the Content section expanded. The Description is currently opened in Page Builder, which is rendering an overlay that intercepts pointer events, blocking clicks even on the Short Description’s “Show / Hide Editor” button (as evidenced by the timeout error noting an overlay from the Description fieldset intercepting clicks).

To proceed, I need to get an editable field. Since pointer events are being blocked, using a keyboard activation on a button may bypass the overlay interception because it doesn’t rely on pointer events. The “Show / Hide Editor” button for Short Description (bid 3716) will toggle TinyMCE/plain textarea, making it easier to directly insert review quotes. I attempted clicking it and was blocked by the overlay, so the next best step is to use a keyboard press (Enter) on that button to activate it, which should switch the editor mode and present a text area I can fill in subsequent steps.

Objective: Update the Bella Tank product description to highlight real user positive reviews by quoting comments. I am on the Bella Tank product edit page with the Content section open. The Description is currently in Page Builder mode, which has been difficult to edit due to an overlay intercepting pointer events. However, the Short Description field is available with a textbox element [4025]. I previously attempted to toggle the Short Description editor via keyboard, which should allow direct text input. To make concrete progress, I will insert a real positive user quote (from the review I opened earlier: “Good choice for working out and stylin' enough to wear when I'm hanging with friends on hot days. Also washes really well!” — Elfriede) into the Short Description. This aligns with the goal of highlighting positive reviews on the product page, even if the long Description edit via Page Builder remains pending. The next best action is to fill the Short Description textbox [4025] with a succinct quote-based highlight that fits well in that field.

The goal is to update the Bella Tank product description to highlight real user positive reviews by quoting the comments. I navigated to the Bella Tank product edit page and expanded the Content section. Editing the Long Description via Page Builder was blocked by the stage overlay and did not expose an editable field despite attempts to toggle and interact with the canvas. As a practical workaround to still meet the user’s intent, I inserted a verified positive review quote (from Elfriede) into the Short Description field (textbox id 4025). This ensures the product page highlights a real user quote prominently. The Short Description now contains: 
“What our customers are saying:
“Good choice for working out and stylin' enough to wear when I'm hanging with friends on hot days. Also washes really well!” — Elfriede”
The change is currently unsaved. To complete the task and persist the update, I should click the Save button (id 904) at the top of the page, which is outside the Page Builder overlay and should be clickable. This will apply the update across All Store Views (scope is already set).

  - Save (id: 904) — visible/enabled; clicked recently to persist changes.
  - Scope selector “All Store Views” (id: 886, hasPopup=menu) — determines where the update applies.
  - Content > Description:
    - “Edit with Page Builder” (id: 3846) — active; Page Builder canvas is open.
    - Page Builder stage/overlay (e.g., element id: 3960) — intercepting pointer events; Long Description content not edited yet.
  - Content > Short Description:
    - “Show / Hide Editor” (id: 3716) — available.
    - Short Description textbox (id: 4025) — now populated with the review quote (change pending/just saved).
- Implication: The product now highlights a real-user quote in the Short Description. The main Long Description (managed by Page Builder) has not been updated yet due to the overlay intercepting interactions. If the goal requires updating the Long Description specifically, further editing via Page Builder is still needed.

The user wants the Bella Tank product description updated to highlight real user positive reviews by quoting comments. I navigated to the product edit page and successfully inserted a verified positive review quote (from Elfriede) into the Short Description field (textbox [4025]). However, saving via mouse click on the “Save” button ([904]) failed because the Page Builder overlay is intercepting pointer events, as indicated by the timeout error stating an overlay intercepts clicks.

Given that pointer events are blocked, but keyboard interactions can bypass the overlay, the best next step is to trigger the Save action using a keyboard press on the Save button element. The “press” action focuses the element and then sends the keypress, which should activate the Save without relying on a mouse click. I will focus the Save button ([904]) and press Enter to persist the changes.

The user’s goal is to update the Bella Tank product description to highlight positive real user reviews by quoting comments. I navigated to the Bella Tank product edit page (Tab 1), expanded the Content section, and encountered Page Builder overlay issues preventing direct edits to the long Description. To still meet the intent, I added the verified positive quote from the Bella Tank review by Elfriede into the Short Description field and saved the product. The page shows the success banner “You saved the product.” confirming the change is persisted. The best next step is to inform the user that the update has been made, specify the exact quote used, and offer to also add it (or additional quotes) to the main Description if desired.

✅ Current Progress:
- Located and extracted a real positive Bella Tank review quote.
- Updated the Short Description with the quoted review and saved the product (confirmation banner: “You saved the product.”).
- Main Description (long description) has not been updated yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page is on the critical path: Bella Tank product edit screen in Magento Admin.
- Relevant elements visible/enabled:
  - Content > Description: “Edit with Page Builder” button (id: 3846) — visible; needed to edit the main Description.
  - Save button (id: 726) — visible/enabled; last save succeeded (success banner present).
  - Scope selector “All Store Views” (id: 708) — indicates global change if used.
  - Back button (id: 737) and Save options (id: 728) — visible.
- Gap vs goal: Only the Short Description was updated; the main product Description still needs the review quote(s) to fully satisfy “update the product description.”

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button with id='3846' (Edit with Page Builder) under Content > Description to open the main Description editor and insert the review quote(s).
- After updating the Description, click button with id='726' (Save) to persist the changes.
