To calculate this, I should access the user's order history and filter by date (January 2023) and by relevant categories (Hair Care and Hair Styling).

✅ Current Progress: Reached the “My Account” dashboard. No filtering to January 2023 or category-specific spending has been performed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward the goal because it provides access to order history needed to calculate spending. Relevant interactive elements:
- Left sidebar navigation: link “My Orders” (visible/clickable) — the primary entry point to full order history.
- Main content → “Recent Orders” table: each row includes a “View Order” link (visible/clickable) to open order details. Current visible orders show 2025 dates, so they are not in Jan 2023.
- Top search: combobox “Search” [266] and “Search” button [271] (button is disabled) — not relevant to the goal.
- “Sign Out” link [225] — unrelated to the task.

The next step is to open the full order history (via “My Orders”) or expand to older orders, then locate orders from January 2023 and review their line items to identify hair care/hair styling purchases and sum their totals.

The goal is to find the total amount spent specifically on hair care and hair styling in January 2023 by reviewing the user's order history. I'm currently on the "My Orders" page, which lists orders with pagination: "Items 1 to 10 of 45 total" and page links 1–5. Page 1 shows mostly 2025 orders and a couple from May 2023. January 2023 will be further back. To efficiently reach Jan 2023, I should use the pagination controls rather than scrolling (scrolling is discouraged and may not be supported). Given there are 45 orders and 10 per page, Page 5 contains the oldest orders; January 2023 is likely among pages 4 or 5. The fastest way is to click "Page 5" (bid 1506), then if needed, adjust to Page 4. Once on the correct page, I can open each "View Order" to inspect line items for hair care/hair styling and sum amounts for January 2023. The next best single action is to click the "Page 5" link to navigate to the oldest orders.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened and reviewed Order #000000148 dated January 29, 2023.
- Identified line items (topiary trees and indoor/outdoor speakers) as non–hair care/hair styling products; contribution to January 2023 hair spend from this order: $0.
- Still need to review other January 2023 orders (e.g., those listed on the My Orders page such as Jan 16, 2023) to compute the total.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (Order #000000148) is on the critical path toward the goal (verifying January 2023 orders and summing hair-related spend).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - “Items Ordered” table [1374]: shows products unrelated to hair care/styling (prices seen at [1393] $260.69 and [1417] $169.95; Grand Total [1440] $440.64). No hair items present.
  - Navigation back options: left-sidebar link “My Orders” [1502] (visible, enabled) to return to the orders list and open other January 2023 orders.
  - Other links on this page: “Reorder” [1363] and “Print Order” [1365] (visible, enabled; not needed for this task).

Task: Determine total spending on hair care and hair styling during January 2023.

Current page: Order #000000148 (dated January 29, 2023). I reviewed the Items Ordered table: it contains an artificial topiary tree and indoor/outdoor speakers—neither are hair care/styling items. Therefore this order contributes $0 to the January hair-related spend.

Next step: I need to check other January 2023 orders listed on the My Orders page (there was also an order on January 16, 2023). To do that efficiently, I should navigate back to the orders list via the left sidebar "My Orders" link present on this page. Once on the orders list, I can open the January 16, 2023 order to review items and compute the total spend.

Action: Click the "My Orders" link in the left sidebar (bid 1489) to return to the orders list.

Objective: Calculate total spent on hair care and hair styling in January 2023 by reviewing order details and summing relevant line items.

Current page context: I’m on the My Orders list page (page 1) showing recent orders (mostly 2025) and a couple from May 2023. January 2023 orders won’t be on this page; earlier I saw that January 2023 orders were on page 2. To efficiently locate January 2023 orders, I should navigate via the pagination controls instead of scrolling.

Plan: Click the Page 2 link to access orders around early 2023 (including January), then open each January order (e.g., 1/29/23, 1/16/23), inspect line items for hair care/hair styling, and sum the amounts.

Goal: Determine how much was spent on hair care and hair style during January 2023.

Current page: "My Orders" page, pagination shows Items 11 to 20 of 45 total, which corresponds to page 2. In the orders table, I can see two January 2023 orders:
- 1/29/23 (Order #000000148) with "View Order" [1467] — I already opened this earlier and confirmed it had no hair-related items (so $0 contribution).
- 1/16/23 (Order #000000163) with "View Order" [1478] — I need to open this to inspect line items for hair care/styling categories.

Plan: Click the "View Order" link for the 1/16/23 order to review its items and identify relevant hair care/styling products. After gathering that, I will sum the amounts and, if necessary, confirm whether there are any other January 2023 orders (but currently only two are visible on this page, so likely just these two). The last attempted action to click a pagination link timed out; I should avoid repeating it and proceed directly with the January 16 order link.

Next action: Click "View Order" for the 1/16/23 order (bid 1478).

The user wants the total amount spent on hair care and hair styling during January 2023. I navigated to the My Orders list and opened the two January 2023 orders.

- Order #000000148 (January 29, 2023): contained non-hair items (topiary tree, speakers) → $0 for hair-related.
- Order #000000163 (January 16, 2023): Items Ordered show:
  - Alaffia Everyday Shea Conditioner — $50.52 (hair care)
  - 10PCS Crystal Headband Pearls Hairbands — $11.99 (hair styling accessory)
  - Revlon Colorsilk Haircolor (Pack of 3) — $17.99 (hair color)
  - Clinique Deep Comfort Body Butter — $31.74 (not hair-related; excluded)

Sum of hair-related subtotals: 50.52 + 11.99 + 17.99 = 80.50. Shipping is order-level and not specific to hair items, so it is excluded per typical interpretation for category spend.

Thus, the total spent on hair care and hair styling in Jan 2023 is 80.50. As per instruction, return just the decimal.
