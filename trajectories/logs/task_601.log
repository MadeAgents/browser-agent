The user wants to post a question in a relevant forum where they'll likely get an answer. On Postmill, "Forums" correspond to subreddits. The correct workflow is to navigate to the relevant forum first, then click Submit to create the post there. The current page shows the home feed and a top navigation bar with a "Forums" link (bid 42). To find an appropriate forum (e.g., something like f/NYC or f/AskNYC), I should click "Forums" to browse or use alphabetical sorting to identify the best match.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward posting the question. Relevant interactive elements:
- Searchbox labeled “Search query” [50]: visible, empty, enabled.
- Forum links: e.g., “AskReddit — AskReddit” [144] (enabled, visible), plus other forum links like “relationship_advice” [164], “worldnews” [184], “news” [204], etc.
- Top navigation “Submit” link [58]: visible, enabled (will open the submission form, but posting should ideally occur within a chosen forum).
- “Sort by: Submissions” button [120]: visible, enabled (dropdown).
- “Create forum” link [139]: visible, enabled (not needed for the goal).

No deviation detected; the agent is on track to select a suitable forum (e.g., AskReddit or a NYC-specific forum, if available via search) before submitting the question.

The goal is to post the question "is car necessary in NYC" in a relevant, active, specialized forum to maximize the chance of getting answers. On the current "List of forums" page, I see many general forums (AskReddit, news, etc.) but nothing NYC-specific in the visible list. Following the tips, the best approach is to use the search box to find a NYC-related forum (e.g., AskNYC or nyc). The page has a searchbox labeled "Search query" [50]. I will first enter "nyc" into the search field; if needed, the next step will be to submit the search (likely by pressing Enter). Using search is more efficient than browsing alphabetically or paging manually.

✅ Current Progress: Performed a site-wide search for “nyc” and arrived on the Search results page. No subreddit/forum has been selected and the question has not been posted yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page shows site-wide search results, which is adjacent but not directly on the critical path to posting in a relevant NYC-focused subreddit/forum. Key interactive elements:
- Searchbox “Search query” [112]: visible, enabled, value='nyc'.
- Button “Search” [115]: visible, enabled.
- Top navigation link “Submit” [56]: visible, enabled (generic submission; may require selecting a forum).
- Top navigation link “Forums” [36]: visible, enabled (leads to forum directory to choose an appropriate target).
- Subreddit links within results (e.g., “newjersey” [135], “Futurology” [180]): visible, enabled; these are examples from results but not NYC-specific.
The page is not yet scoped to an NYC-relevant forum, which is necessary to maximize answers to the question.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link “Forums” [36] to open the forum directory, then navigate to an NYC-relevant forum before submitting the post.

The goal is to post the user's question in a forum where they're likely to get answers. We’re currently on the “Create submission” page for the “nyc” forum, but the sidebar indicates “No subscribers 0,” suggesting low activity. Per the site tips, we should choose a more active, specialized forum (e.g., AskNYC). The submission form includes a “Forum” combobox [379] with an editable textbox [380] currently set to “nyc.” To move toward posting in a better forum, the next step is to change the forum selection. I will attempt to update the forum combobox to “asknyc” by filling the textbox. After changing the forum, I can then fill the Body and submit in subsequent steps.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Expand the forum combobox [379] and select an active NYC-related forum if available; or type “asknyc” into the forum textbox [380] and press Enter to apply the change.
- If no suitable forum appears, use the searchbox “Search query” [53]: type “asknyc” and press Enter, then navigate to that forum and use its “Submit” to post.

The task is to post the user's question in a forum where they're likely to get an answer. We're on the "Create submission" page with Title already set to "is car necessary in NYC".

The user's goal is to post the question “is car necessary in NYC” in a forum where they'll likely get an answer. We’re on the “Create submission” page with Title and Body already filled, and the Forum combobox shows “nyc.” When I tried to click “Create submission,” the action failed because the open Forum dropdown (select2) intercepted pointer events, as indicated by the timeout message mentioning a span “nyc” overlay.

To proceed, I need to close the dropdown so that the “Create submission” button becomes clickable. The safest way to close the select2 dropdown without changing the forum selection is to send an Escape keypress to the combobox. After the dropdown collapses, I can submit the post in the next step.

The user’s goal is to post their question “is car necessary in NYC” in a forum where they’re likely to get an answer. We navigated to the NYC forum and opened the “Create submission” page. The Title [138] and Body [143] are already filled with the exact question, and the Forum combobox [379] is set to “nyc” and currently collapsed (I previously closed it with Escape to avoid overlay issues). The preview shows the content correctly. Per the site tips, leaving the URL field empty is acceptable since content goes in the Body. The next step is to submit the form by clicking the “Create submission” button [396]. Previously, clicking submit was blocked by the open dropdown; now that the dropdown is closed, the button should be clickable. Submitting will complete the posting in the specialized NYC forum, which is appropriate for this question.

✅ Current Progress:
- The question has been successfully posted as a new submission in forum “nyc”. The post title and body both read “is car necessary in NYC”, and it shows “0 seconds ago” with no comments yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page displays the published post and its comments section—posting is complete. However, the sidebar indicates “Subscribe No subscribers 0,” suggesting the “nyc” forum has no subscribers, which may not meet the “likely to get an answer” part of the goal.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Comment textbox labeled “Comment” [178]: required, empty, visible.
  - “Post” button [318]: visible.
  - Top navigation “Forums” link [45]: visible; can be used to find other forums.
  - Searchbox “Search query” [57]: empty; visible; can be used to locate a more active forum.
  - “Submit” link [65]: visible (for creating posts, typically within the current forum).
  - Sidebar “Subscribe” button [341]: visible; shows “No subscribers 0”.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- To satisfy the “likely to get an answer” requirement, navigate to find a more active forum:
  1) Click link “Forums” [45].
  2) Type “asknyc” into the searchbox “Search query” [57] and press Enter to locate a more active NYC Q&A forum, then proceed to submit the question there.

The post has been created in the nyc forum, but the sidebar indicates “No subscribers 0,” which suggests low activity and may not meet the “likely to get an answer” requirement. To find a more active, specialized forum (e.g., AskNYC), I should navigate to the Forums directory, which is better for locating specific subforums. From there, I can use the search to find a more suitable forum and then submit the question. The top navigation includes a “Forums” link [45]; clicking it is the optimal next step.
