The user wants to display issues in the keycloak/keycloak repository with labels related to flaky-test. I’m currently on the GitLab dashboard. The site-specific tips say not to use the global search bar and instead navigate directly to the search URL format to find repositories. Therefore, my next step is to go to the GitLab search page with the query "keycloak" to locate the "keycloak/keycloak" project. Once I find it, I can navigate to its Issues tab and apply a label filter for "flaky" or "flaky-test". But first, I need to open the search results. I will use goto with the prescribed URL pattern: /search?search=keycloak&nav_source=navbar.
