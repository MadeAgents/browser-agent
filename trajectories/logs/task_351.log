The user wants me to list products from the PS4 accessories category, sorted by ascending price. According to the tips, I should navigate using dropdown menus instead of search when browsing categories. On the current homepage, there is a top navigation menu with a "Video Games" item (menuitem with id [1189]) that likely has subcategories. To access "PS4 accessories," I should hover over "Video Games" to reveal its submenu and then look for a PS4 or PlayStation 4 accessories subcategory to click. The first step is to hover on "Video Games" to expose the nested menu options.

The user wants products from the PS4 accessories category listed by ascending price. I’m already on the correct category page, confirmed by the breadcrumb and the heading. To sort the products by ascending price, I should use the “Sort By” combobox. It currently shows “Position” and has options including “Price.” There’s also a “Set Descending Direction” link, which implies the current direction is ascending; clicking it would switch to descending, which we don’t want. Therefore, the best next step is to change the “Sort By” combobox to “Price” to sort the items in ascending price order.
