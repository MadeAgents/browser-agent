The user wants the path and travel time from "the big apple" (New York City) to the biggest city in Maine (Portland, Maine). On the OpenStreetMap page, to get directions, I should open the directions interface rather than using the basic search box. The Accessibility Tree shows a link labeled "Find directions between two points" with bid 167, which corresponds to the two-arrow directions button mentioned in the tips. Clicking this should open the directions panel where I can enter the origin and destination and then compute the route to get distance and travel time. Therefore, the next step is to click that directions link.

The user wants the route and travel time from “the big apple” (New York City) to the largest city in Maine (Portland). The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with Car mode and OSRM selected. The From field shows “City of New York, New York, United States” and the To field shows “Portland, Cumberland County, Maine, United States.” The results area displays “Distance: 507km. Time: 6:35” and shows a turn‑by‑turn list. Since the information is already computed and visible, I don’t need further interactions. I should send a concise summary including the travel time and a clear route overview using the main roads, matching names from the page. I will use send_msg_to_user to provide the result succinctly.
