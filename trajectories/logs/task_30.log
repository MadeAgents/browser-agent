The user asks for the count of comments with more downvotes than upvotes for the user who made the latest post on the space forum. To do this, I need to:
1) Navigate to the list of forums to find the "space" forum. The tips indicate using the Forums tab and possibly an alphabetical list.
2) Open the "space" forum and identify the latest post (likely by sorting by "New" or viewing the top item if already sorted by newest).
3) Open the post details via the "comments" link (not the title, per the platform tips) to reliably stay within the site, but I mainly need the poster’s username.
4) Navigate to that user's profile to access their Comments list.
5) Determine which comments have more downvotes than upvotes and count them.

Currently on the home page with navigation visible, including a "Forums" link (bid 42). First step: click Forums to reach the forum list so I can find "space".

The user wants the count of comments with more downvotes than upvotes for the user who made the latest post in the space forum. I’m currently on the space forum page, but it’s sorted by “Hot,” not by the latest posts.

The next step is to click this button to access the sort options, then I can select “New” afterward. This aligns with the benchmark tip to use filters and sorting rather than scrolling.
