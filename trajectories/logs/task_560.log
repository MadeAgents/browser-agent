The user's goal is to create a repository named "nolan_academy_awards" with a README containing movies that won Academy Awards by Christopher Nolan. On the current GitLab dashboard page, I can already see an existing project titled "Byte Blaze / nolan_academy_awards" in the list of repositories (accessibility tree entry [667]). Since the repository appears to exist, the next step is to navigate into it to check if a README exists and, if not, add one; or if it exists, edit it to include the list of Nolan's Oscar-winning films. To proceed, I should click the repository link to open its page where I can add or edit files. I will click the "Byte Blaze / nolan_academy_awards" link.
