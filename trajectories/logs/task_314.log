The user wants the top 3 contributors by commits for the prime/design repo. On the dashboard, I see a project listed as "Primer / design," which likely corresponds to the intended repo (possibly a typo by the user). To get contributor information, I should open the project and then locate the "Contributors" tab under the repository section since it shows contributors and their number of commits. The current page shows the "Primer / design" project entry with a clickable link element [320] labeled "Primer / design." The appropriate next step is to click this link to enter the repository page, where I can then navigate to the Contributors view.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward the goal; the contributors list is typically accessible from the repository or analytics sections.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link “Repository” (id: [295]) — visible/enabled; should expose repository subpages including Contributors.
  - Link “921 Commits” (id: [642]) — visible/enabled; navigates to commits view (may provide navigation to contributors from there).
  - Link “Analytics” (id: [469]) — visible/enabled; may include a contributors view with commit counts.

The user wants the top 3 contributors by commit count for the Primer/design repository. On GitLab, contributor statistics are typically accessible via the Repository section under a "Contributors" subpage. The current page shows the repository’s Files view, with sidebar navigation including a "Repository" link (bid 295). To reach the Contributors page, I should first interact with the "Repository" item to reveal or navigate to its submenus, where "Contributors" should be available. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best action is to click the "Repository" link to expose or navigate to the repository subpages, enabling me to select "Contributors" in a subsequent step.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly relevant to the goal. It lists contributors with commit activity and is the correct place to identify the top committers.

The user asks for the names of the top 3 contributors to the Primer/design repository, ranked by number of commits. I’m already on the Contributors page for Primer/design (the breadcrumb shows Primer / design and the heading “Commits to main”). The page lists contributors with their commit counts and appears sorted by commits in descending order at the top. 

From the top entries displayed:
- Shawn Allen — 95 commits
- Inayaili León — 77 commits
- Aurora Pleguezuelo — 66 commits

These are clearly the top three by commit count. The user requested names only, ranked, so I will provide a concise enumerated list with the names in order.
