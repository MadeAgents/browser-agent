The user asks for key aspects customers dislike about "Circe ice fleece." To answer, I need to find customer reviews for that specific product. The Magento Admin provides reviews under MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews per the tips. The Marketing menu is already open, and I can see the "All Reviews" link (accessibility node [287]). Clicking it should take me to the reviews grid where I can filter by product name (e.g., "Circe ice fleece") and read the review details to extract negative feedback themes.

The user asks for key aspects customers don’t like about the “Circe ice fleece.” I’m currently on the Edit Review page for one review (ID 353) of “Circe Hooded Ice Fleece.” This review provides multiple negative points: poor material quality (pilling), bad fit (short sleeves, baggy body), not warm, oversized hood, and not worth the price. However, earlier I saw that the reviews grid had “2 records found” for this product (IDs 353 and 352). To ensure I capture “customers” (plural) sentiments and identify key recurring or additional dislikes, I should open the other review as well. The Edit Review page has a “Next” button (bid 697), which in Magento typically navigates to the next record in the filtered collection. Clicking “Next” should take me to the second review without returning to the grid. That will let me extract any additional negative themes or confirm patterns.

The reviews grid previously indicated 2 records for this product, so to capture all customer dislikes, I should open the other review as well. The page provides navigation controls including a “Previous” button (bid 695), which should move to the other review in the filtered set. My last attempt to use “Save and Previous” (bid 697) timed out; therefore, I will avoid repeating that action and instead click “Previous.” After viewing the other review, I can synthesize the key negative themes across both reviews.

The user asks for the key aspects customers don’t like about the “Circe ice fleece.” I’m on the Edit Review page for one review (ID 353) of “Circe Hooded Ice Fleece,” which contains several negative points (material pilling, poor fit, not warm, oversized hood, poor value). Earlier, I saw there were 2 reviews total for this product. To ensure I capture all disliked aspects across customers, I should navigate to the other review as well. The page has a “Next” button (bid 697) that should move to the next review record in the filtered set. My last action attempted “Previous” and timed out; I will avoid repeating that and instead click “Next” to view the second review and then synthesize both.

The user wants the key aspects customers don’t like about the Circe ice fleece. I’m currently on the Edit Review page for “Circe Hooded Ice Fleece” (review ID 352), which mentions the color being more muted than expected. Earlier, I opened the other review (ID 353) for the same product from the reviews grid and noted several additional negative points: pilling after one wash, poor fit (short sleeves and baggy body), not warm enough, oversized hood that falls over the face, and not worth the price. Combining both reviews provides a comprehensive list of disliked aspects. Since I already have the necessary information from both reviews, the best next step is to send the summarized answer to the user.
