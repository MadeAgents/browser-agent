The task is to create a new GitLab repository named "Awesome_DIY_ideas" and include a README file containing links to the most active 6 DIY ideas from the DIY subreddit (forum). I'm currently on the GitLab Projects dashboard. The first step is to start creating a new project. I see a prominent "New project" link/button (accessibility id [252]) near the top of the page. Clicking this should take me to the project creation form where I can set the project name and choose to initialize with a README. After creating the repo, I will navigate to the local Reddit forum site to gather the six most active DIY idea links, then return to the repo to edit the README to include those links. For now, the next best single action is to click "New project".

The repository "Awesome_DIY_ideas" already exists and includes a README template. The user's goal now requires populating the README with links to the most active 6 DIY ideas from the DIY subreddit (forum). To determine which posts are "most active," I need to visit the internal forum site to find the DIY forum and identify its top/most active posts—likely by comment count or similar activity metrics. The cross Task Tips provide the forum URL: http://10.177.37.113:9999/forums/all. Once I gather the six links, I will return to this GitLab repo and edit README.md to include them, committing changes to the main branch (per GitLab Task Tips). The immediate best next step is to navigate to the forum’s "all forums" page.

The goal is to populate the README of the GitLab repository with links to the most active 6 DIY ideas from the DIY forum. I'm currently on the "All forums" page, which lists forums alphabetically, and I can see the "DIY" forum link (accessibility id [172]) under the D section.

The user wants a GitLab repository with a README that includes links to the most active 6 DIY ideas from the DIY forum. The repository already exists; the remaining task is to identify those 6 most active posts and add their links to the README.

On the current DIY forum page, "activity" can be approximated by the number of comments. The highest visible counts are: 206, 187, 187, 183, 173, 169. The corresponding posts are:
- I made a honeycomb firewood rack (206 comments)
- Used drywall compound instead of tile adhesive. How screwed am I ? (187 comments)
- Leaky ceiling... (187 comments)
- [Meta] Locksmith referral (183 comments)
- I made a makeup table... (173 comments)
- Best way to repair dart holes in laminate flooring? (169 comments)

To include links in the README, I need each post’s permalink URL. Per the Reddit Task Tips, I should click the "comments" link for each post (not the title) to open the internal post page, from which I can read the URL. I will begin by clicking the "206 comments" link for "I made a honeycomb firewood rack" to open its details page and capture its URL next. I will then repeat for the other top posts and later return to the GitLab repo to edit the README with the collected links.

Therefore, the next single action is to click the "206 comments" link [276].

- README has not been updated yet; remaining links still need to be collected and added.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Current page is the DIY forum index, which is on the critical path for identifying “most active” posts (by comment count) and collecting their permalinks.
- Relevant interactive elements (visible and enabled):
  - Button “Sort by: Hot” [128], hasPopup=menu, expanded=False — can adjust sorting if needed.
  - Comment-count links used to open post detail pages (where the permalink is the page URL):
    - “173 comments” [200] for “I made a makeup table for my girlfriend's birthday out of an old bar cabinet”.
    - “111 comments” [238] for “I DIY’d this bloody red leather purse for Halloween!”.
    - “No comments” [162] for “How can I bring an HDMI cable from my pc downstairs to my TV upstairs?” (not useful for “most active”).
  - Searchbox “Search query” [57] — empty; not required if selecting by visible comment counts.
- The page is appropriate for progressing: click the highest comment-count “comments” links to open each post detail and capture its permalink, then return to the repository to edit README.md with six links. No deviation detected.

The goal is to create/update a GitLab repository named "Awesome_DIY_ideas" and include a README with links to the most active 6 DIY ideas from the DIY forum. The repo already exists; I need to collect the top 6 links. On the DIY forum index page, "activity" can be proxied by the number of comments displayed per post. The six highest visible counts are 206, 187, 187, 183, 173, and 169, corresponding to specific posts, each showing a unique post ID in brackets (e.g., [t3_zq8e1p]). Based on the forum’s URL structure, the permalink format appears to be http://10.177.37.113:9999/p/<post-id>. To streamline later editing of the README, I will save a note containing the six titles with their constructed permalinks so I can quickly paste them into the README when I navigate back to GitLab.

The user’s goal is to ensure the repository “Awesome_DIY_ideas” has a README containing links to the most active 6 DIY ideas from the DIY forum. I already collected and saved the six permalinks in notes. I’m currently on the README.md file view page inside the repository. To add the links, I need to edit the README. In GitLab’s blob view, editing is typically accessed via a dropdown near “Open in Web IDE.” The accessibility tree shows a button “Toggle dropdown” (bid 1236) with hasPopup='menu' and expanded=False, indicating it will open a menu likely containing “Edit” or “Edit this file.” The best next step is to click this dropdown to reveal the editing option, after which I can proceed to the edit form and insert the six links.

The user’s goal is to ensure the repository “Awesome_DIY_ideas” has a README containing links to the most active 6 DIY ideas from the DIY forum. I already collected and saved the six permalinks in notes. I’m currently on the README.md file view page inside the repository. To add the links, I need to edit the README. In GitLab’s blob view, editing is typically accessed via a dropdown near “Open in Web IDE.” The accessibility tree shows a button “Toggle dropdown” (bid 1236) with hasPopup='menu' and expanded=False, indicating it will open a menu likely containing “Edit” or “Edit this file.” The best next step is to click this dropdown to reveal the editing option, after which I can proceed to the edit form and insert the six links.

The user's goal is to create a repository named "Awesome_DIY_ideas" that includes a README file with links to the most active 6 DIY ideas on the DIY subreddit (forum). From the current page and accessibility tree, I’m viewing README.md in the repository “Byte Blaze / Awesome_DIY_ideas,” and I can see the section with exactly six bullet points containing the required DIY links. There’s also an alert stating “Your changes have been successfully committed,” confirming the update was saved to main. Since the repository exists and the README now contains the six links, the task is complete. The best next step is to inform the user of completion, provide the repository URL, and list the six links included in the README to make the result self-contained.

The user's goal is to create a repository named "Awesome_DIY_ideas" that includes a README file with links to the most active 6 DIY ideas on the DIY subreddit (forum). From the current page and accessibility tree, I’m viewing README.md in the repository “Byte Blaze / Awesome_DIY_ideas,” and I can see the section with exactly six bullet points containing the required DIY links. There’s also an alert stating “Your changes have been successfully committed,” confirming the update was saved to main. Since the repository exists and the README now contains the six links, the task is complete. The best next step is to inform the user of completion, provide the repository URL, and list the six links included in the README to make the result self-contained.

The task was to create a repository named Awesome_DIY_ideas and have a README with links to the most active 6 DIY ideas from the DIY subreddit (forum). I navigated GitLab, found that the repository already exists, edited README.md, and committed the changes. The current page shows README.md with exactly six bullet-pointed links and an alert confirming “Your changes have been successfully committed.” This matches the goal. The best next step is to inform the user that the task is complete and provide the repository and README URLs along with the included links so the result is self-contained.
