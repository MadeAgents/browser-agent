The user's goal is to identify the customer(s) with the second most number of completed orders across the store's entire history. Based on the Task Tips, this is best found via the Reports menu, specifically an "Order Count" report. To proceed, I should navigate to REPORTS from the Magento Admin Dashboard. From there, I will look for a report such as "Customers" > "Order Count" where I can set the date range from Jan 1, 2022 to today (entire history), then interpret the results to find the second-highest order count and identify the customer(s). The current page shows the Dashboard with a top navigation bar including a "REPORTS" link (bid 339). The next step is to click REPORTS.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the Reports section from the Magento Admin dashboard; the Reports menu overlay is visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is on the critical path toward the goal. The Reports overlay shows the “Customers” reports, which include:
- Link labeled “Order Count” (id: 417) — visible and clickable; this is the key report needed to find customers by number of orders.
- Link labeled “Order Total” (id: 414) — visible and clickable; not essential for this goal.

Next expected step toward the goal is to access “Customers > Order Count” (id: 417) to view customers ranked by number of orders, then identify the customer(s) with the second-highest completed order count.

The user asks: Which customer(s) has completed the second most number of orders in the entire history? To answer, I should use Magento’s Reports > Customers > Order Count report. The Task Tips indicate a standard approach: go to Reports > Order Count, set the date range from 01/01/2022 to Today (entire store history), and choose Show By: Year. Additionally, since the question specifies “completed” orders, I should set the Order Status filter to “Specified” and select “Complete” (not a dropdown but a 1-of-n selection UI per tip #5). 

Currently, I’m on the Dashboard and I opened the Reports overlay already. I can see the “Order Count” link (id 417) within the Customers section of the Reports menu. The next step is to click “Order Count” to open that report page where I can configure filters (date range, status, etc.). Only a single action is allowed per step, so I will click the Order Count link now.

The user’s question is to identify the customer(s) with the second most number of completed orders over the store’s entire history. I’m on the Magento Admin page for Reports > Customers > Order Count, with the date range set from 01/01/2022 to 12/18/2025 and Show By = Year. The table is populated with rows grouped by year. I need to find the highest order count across the entire table, then identify the second highest distinct count and list all customers who match it.

From the 2022 group, the highest count is 8 (Jane Smith). The next distinct count is 5, and several customers have 5 orders in 2022: John Smith, Jane Doe, Bob Johnson, Matt Baker, Grace Nguyen, Lucy Garcia, Ava Brown, Adam Garcia. In 2023, the maximum is 5 for Michael Nguyen. There are no records for 2024 and 2025. Therefore, the second-most order count across the entire history is 5, and the customers with that count are the nine listed above.

I will now send the answer to the user with the full customer names, as required by the instructions.
