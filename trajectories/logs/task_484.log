The user wants me to invite Jakub Klinkovský to the dotfiles repository as a guest. From the tips, "dotfiles" is one of the repositories, and the recommended way to find a repo is to use the search URL directly rather than the global search bar. So first, I should navigate to the GitLab search results for "dotfiles." Once I find and click into the dotfiles project, I will go to Project information > Members and use the "Invite members" button to invite Jakub Klinkovský with the Guest role. For now, the immediate next step is to open the search page for "dotfiles."
