The user wants to browse products in the "Cabinets, Racks & Shelves" category. On the homepage, there's a left-side vertical navigation with top-level categories, each marked as a menuitem with hasPopup='menu', which suggests submenus appear on hover. To follow best practices for browsing tasks (use dropdown menus via hover), I should hover over the likely parent category to expose subcategories. "Cabinets, Racks & Shelves" most likely falls under "Tools & Home Improvement" (bid 867). The next step is to hover over "Tools & Home Improvement" to reveal its submenu and look for "Cabinets, Racks & Shelves".

✅ Current Progress: Began navigating categories by hovering the “Tools & Home Improvement” menu to expose its submenu.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the One Stop Market homepage with the vertical category navigation—this is on the critical path to reach “Cabinets, Racks & Shelves.”
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - menuitem “Tools & Home Improvement” [867]: visible, enabled, hasPopup=menu (currently hovered/expanded).
  - submenu [870]: visible; contains menuitem “Lighting & Ceiling Fans” [872] (not the target).
  - Other top-level categories (all visible/enabled, hasPopup=menu): “Office Products” [835], “Home & Kitchen” [708], etc.
  - Search combobox [386] (empty, can accept text) with “Search” button [391] disabled until input is provided.
- The target subcategory “Cabinets, Racks & Shelves” is not yet visible in the current submenu.

The user wants to browse the "Cabinets, Racks & Shelves" category. From the homepage, the left vertical navigation shows multiple top-level categories with hasPopup='menu', meaning subcategories appear on hover. I already hovered "Tools & Home Improvement" (867) and saw only one subcategory "Lighting & Ceiling Fans" (872), which likely doesn't contain "Cabinets, Racks & Shelves." The target could plausibly be under "Office Products" or "Home & Kitchen."

The goal is to browse products in the "Cabinets, Racks & Shelves" category. The site uses a vertical navigation with nested dropdowns that appear on hover. I previously hovered "Office Products" (835), which revealed a submenu including "Office Furniture & Lighting" (856). "Cabinets, Racks & Shelves" is likely a subcategory under "Office Furniture & Lighting." To expose the next level of subcategories, I should hover "Office Furniture & Lighting" to reveal its submenu, then I can click "Cabinets, Racks & Shelves" once it appears. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best single action is to hover "Office Furniture & Lighting."
