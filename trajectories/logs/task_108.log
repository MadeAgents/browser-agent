The user asks for monthly count of successful orders from January to May 2023. In Magento Admin, such data is typically obtained via REPORTS > Orders, where we can set a date range, choose Order Status (using the 1-of-n selection UI per tip #5), and show results grouped by Month. From the current Dashboard page, I should first navigate to the REPORTS section. The accessibility tree shows a top navigation menubar with a link labeled "REPORTS" (bid 339).

- link “Orders” [383] — visible, enabled/clickable.
Other links present but likely not needed for monthly successful order counts:
- link “Order Count” [417] — visible, enabled (under Customers; not the Sales Orders report).
- link “Refresh Statistics” [448] — visible, enabled.
The “Orders” report [383] is the essential next destination to configure date range (01/2023–05/2023), order status (successful), and grouping by month to obtain MM:COUNT.

The user needs the monthly count of successful orders between January and May 2023 in MM:COUNT format.

The user wants monthly counts of successful orders from January through May 2023 in MM:COUNT format. I am on the Orders Report page where I can configure filters. The Period is already set to Month, and the From date is already set to 01/01/2023. The To date is currently empty, so the immediate next step is to fill it with 05/31/2023 to constrain the report to the requested range. After that, I will set Order Status to “Specified” and choose the status representing successful orders (typically “Complete”), then click Show Report to retrieve counts by month. Since only one action is allowed now, I will fill the To date field.

The task is to present the monthly count of successful orders from January to May 2023. We’re on the Orders Report page with filters visible. The Period is already set to Month, the From and To dates are set correctly (01/01/2023 to 05/31/2023). To interpret “successful orders,” I should select orders with the status “Complete.” To do that in Magento’s Orders Report, I must switch the Order Status combobox from “Any” to “Specified,” which will then reveal the list of individual statuses in a 1-of-n selection UI (per tip #5). The Order Status combobox is currently expanded with “Any” selected; I need to click “Specified” to proceed, after which I can pick “Complete” and then click Show Report to get the counts.

The goal is to present the monthly count of successful orders (interpreted as "Complete" status) for 01/2023–05/2023 in MM:COUNT format. I'm on the Orders Report page with filters. The Period is set to Month, From is 01/01/2023, and To is 05/31/2023. The Order Status combobox currently shows value "Any" and is expanded. My previous attempt to click the "Specified" option failed due to it not being visible. To avoid repeating the same click and hitting the same visibility issue, a better approach is to use keyboard navigation to change the Order Status from "Any" to "Specified" by focusing the combobox and pressing ArrowDown, which should select the next option ("Specified"). Once set to "Specified", I can then pick the "Complete" status in the subsequent step and run the report.

Objective: Present the monthly count of successful orders from 01/2023 to 05/2023 in MM:COUNT format.

Current page: Orders Report in Magento Admin. Filters show:
- Date Used: Order Created
- Period: Month
- From: 01/01/2023
- To: 05/31/2023
- Order Status: Specified (value now set to Specified; status selection UI not visible yet)
- Empty Rows: No
- Show Actual Values: No
- Results show "0 records found"

Considerations:
- We need monthly counts for Jan–May 2023. If there are months with zero orders, they won't appear unless "Empty Rows" is set to Yes. To ensure we get a row per month (even zeros), we should set Empty Rows to Yes before running the report.
- After ensuring Empty Rows = Yes, we should click "Show Report" to populate the grid. Then we can read monthly "Orders" counts for each interval.

Plan:
1) Change "Empty Rows" from No to Yes (so months with zero will appear).
2) Click "Show Report" to refresh.
3) Read the table rows for January–May 2023 and return in MM:COUNT format.

Since only a single action is allowed per step, do step 1 now by switching "Empty Rows" to Yes. Using keyboard navigation (ArrowUp) on the combobox is efficient to change from "No" to "Yes".

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the Orders Report page.
- Set Period to “Month”.
- Entered date range From 01/01/2023 to 05/31/2023.
- Changed “Order Status” to “Specified”.
- Set “Empty Rows” to “Yes”.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path to the goal (monthly counts for 01/2023–05/2023).
- Relevant interactive elements and current states:
  - combobox “Date Used” [741] — value: “Order Created”, visible.
  - combobox “Period” [749] — value: “Month”, visible.
  - textbox “From *” [757] — value: “01/01/2023”, filled.
  - textbox “To *” [764] — value: “05/31/2023”, filled.
  - combobox “Order Status” [771] — value: “Specified”, visible.
  - listbox (specific statuses) [779] — multiselect; currently one status is selected (appears to be “Payment Review”), which does not match “successful” (“Complete”).
  - combobox “Empty Rows” [793] — value: “Yes”.
  - combobox “Show Actual Values” [800] — value: “No”.
  - button “Show Report” [714] — visible/enabled.
- Results grid shows “0 records found,” likely due to the current (incorrect) status selection.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- In the Order Status listbox [779], select “Complete” (deselect any others), then click the “Show Report” button [714] to populate monthly counts for 01/2023–05/2023.

The user needs the monthly count of successful orders (interpreted as “Complete” status) from January to May 2023 in MM:COUNT format. We are on the Orders Report page with filters:
- Period: Month
- From: 01/01/2023
- To: 05/31/2023
- Order Status: Specified
- The listbox of statuses [779] is visible and currently has “Payment Review” selected (option 785).
- Empty Rows: Yes

To get the correct data, I must change the selected status in the listbox to “Complete” and then run the report. Since the listbox is already focused (last action clicked it), the most reliable way to navigate is to press Home to go to the first item (“Canceled”), then I can move down to “Complete” in subsequent steps. For now, I will press Home to position at the start of the list, ensuring predictable navigation to “Complete” next.
