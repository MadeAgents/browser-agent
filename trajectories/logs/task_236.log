The user wants the nearest pharmacy from Carnegie Mellon that can be walked within 20 minutes. On OpenStreetMap, the best approach is:
1) Search for the starting location (Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA) using the Search box to get centered on the area.
2) Then find nearby pharmacies and compare walking routes/times using the directions tool (two arrows) to ensure it’s within 20 minutes.

Given only one action per step, I will first enter "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" into the Search textbox that is currently focused (element [162]) to locate CMU on the map. After this, I will click Go in the next step.

- Search textbox labeled “Search” (id/index [162]): populated with “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA”, focused.
- “Go” button next to search (id/index [165]): visible; triggers the search to center the map on CMU.
- “Find directions between two points” link (id/index [167]): visible; will be useful to estimate walking time once a candidate pharmacy is selected.
- “Query features” link (id/index [454]): visible; can inspect map objects after navigating to CMU.
- “Welcome to OpenStreetMap!” panel with “Close” button (id/index [217]): visible; may be dismissed if it obstructs interaction.

Goal: Find the nearest pharmacy from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) that can be walked within 20 minutes, using the current OpenStreetMap interface. The map is already centered on CMU with search results showing the university. To identify nearby pharmacies efficiently, the best next step is to use the search bar with a location-biased query so Nominatim returns pharmacies near the current map center. Then, after identifying candidates, I can use the directions tool to estimate walking time and ensure it’s within 20 minutes.

Given only one action per step, I will now replace the search text with “pharmacy near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” to retrieve nearby pharmacy results. After results appear, I can select the closest option and then use the directions tool to compute walking time from CMU to that pharmacy.

✅ Current Progress:
- OpenStreetMap is open.
- The search box has been updated to “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA”.
- The map/results are still centered around Tucson; no nearby CMU pharmacy identified and no walking time evaluated yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is relevant but currently off-track. The map shows University of Arizona/Tucson and a pharmacy pin there, not Pittsburgh.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Search textbox “Search” [162]: value = “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA”; visible, focused, editable.
  - “Go” button [165]: visible and clickable; needs to be used to recenter on CMU.
  - “Find directions between two points” link [167]: visible; to be used after selecting a nearby pharmacy.
  - Search Results list [515]: currently shows unrelated pharmacy results (e.g., Tucson); indicates the search hasn’t been re-submitted for CMU.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the “Go” button [165] to center the map on Carnegie Mellon University.
- After the map centers on CMU, type “pharmacy” into the Search textbox [162] and click “Go” [165] to list nearby pharmacies.

Goal: Find the nearest pharmacy from Carnegie Mellon that can be walked within 20 minutes. The current OpenStreetMap page shows a search textbox [162] containing “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA,” but the map and results are still centered around Tucson (University of Arizona), indicating the new CMU query hasn’t been executed yet.

The user asks for the nearest pharmacy from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) that can be walked within 20 minutes. We're on OpenStreetMap centered on CMU. To find nearby pharmacies efficiently, I should use the search bar with “pharmacy” so Nominatim returns pharmacies within the current map view around CMU. After results appear, I can select a nearby pharmacy and then use the directions tool (two arrows icon) to compute a walking route/time from CMU to confirm it’s within 20 minutes.

We’re on OpenStreetMap with the map centered on CMU, and the search box currently contains “pharmacy.” To retrieve nearby pharmacies, I should execute the search. The Search textbox [162] already has the right query, and the “Go” button [165] will submit it. After results appear, I’ll identify the closest candidate and then use the directions (two-arrow) tool to compute a walking route and time to verify it’s within 20 minutes. The immediate next step is to click the “Go” button to get the list of nearby pharmacies.

✅ Current Progress:
- OpenStreetMap is open and the map appears centered around Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Pittsburgh.
- The “pharmacy” query has been entered and submitted via the “Go” button.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is generally on the critical path (map near CMU, search interface available), but current search results are off-target: the results list shows pharmacies in distant locations (e.g., Tucson, Cameroon), not near CMU.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Search textbox [162] (“Search”): value = “pharmacy”; visible, editable.
  - “Go” button [165]: visible, enabled; used to submit searches.
  - “Find directions between two points” link [167]: visible; for routing once a local pharmacy is selected.
  - Search Results list: visible; current items show non-Pittsburgh locations (links clickable but irrelevant to the goal).
  - “Close” button [209]: visible; closes the results panel if needed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Refine the search to be location-specific: type “pharmacy Pittsburgh, PA” into the search textbox [162], then click the “Go” button [165].
- After local results appear, select the closest pharmacy and use “Find directions between two points” [167] to compute a walking route/time from CMU.

The goal is to find the nearest pharmacy to Carnegie Mellon University that is walkable within 20 minutes using the OpenStreetMap directions panel. The current page shows:
- Directions panel open with From set to CMU (correct).
- Mode set to Foot (correct).
- To field contains “pharmacy near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” which failed to resolve, and there is a “Search failed” modal dialog blocking interaction.

To proceed, I first need to dismiss the blocking “Search failed” dialog so I can edit the To field. After closing it, I will enter a location-biased query like “pharmacy” in the To field to get nearby results around CMU, then compute walking time. For now, the optimal next single action is to click Close on the modal.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened OpenStreetMap’s Directions panel.
- Set origin correctly: “From” textbox [194] = Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA.
- Travel mode is set to Foot (radio [179] checked).
- Dismissed earlier “Search failed” modal and attempted destination search.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Partially on track: Using Directions with correct origin and Foot mode, but the destination is incorrect.
- Destination field: “To” textbox [199] = “pharmacy near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” (editable/visible). Despite this, routing shows a long-distance route.
- Evidence of being off-track: Directions table shows Distance 3266km, Time 37:17 [716–719] and step list consistent with a cross-country route, indicating the destination resolved far from Pittsburgh (map shows a route toward Tucson).
- Relevant controls:
  - Mode radios: Car [173]=unchecked, Bicycle [176]=unchecked, Foot [179]=checked.
  - Directions service combobox [182]=OSRM (fine to keep).
  - Reverse Directions button [200] available.
  - Close button for the routing panel [187] (not needed now).

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Replace the incorrect destination with a local query: type “pharmacy, Pittsburgh, PA” into the “To” textbox [199] to bias results to CMU’s area.
- If the route does not recompute in walking mode, click the “Foot” label [180] to ensure Foot routing is applied.
