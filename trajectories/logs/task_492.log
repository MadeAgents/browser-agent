The user wants me to notify Jane Doe on their most recent pending order with a specific message. In Magento Admin, this is typically done through Sales > Orders. From the Dashboard, I need to navigate to the Sales section, then to Orders, filter or search for Jane Doe, ensure I sort by Purchase Date descending (as per the benchmark rule), and pick the most recent order with status Pending. Then, add a comment with "sorry we are out of stock, please reorder" and ensure the customer is notified (usually by checking "Notify Customer" and submitting the comment).

The current page shows the Magento Admin Dashboard with the horizontal menu containing SALES [156]. The first step is to click SALES to access the Sales area, where I expect to find Orders. I should avoid unnecessary scrolling and use navigation. So, I will click the SALES menu item to proceed.

The user wants to notify Jane Doe on their most recent pending order with a specific message.

Currently, I’m on the Dashboard with the Sales menu expanded on the left sidebar overlay. The “Orders” link is visible in the Sales submenu with bid 168.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path for notifying a customer via an order. However, an active filter “Status: Canceled” is applied, which will hide Pending orders needed for this task.
- Active filters: “Status: Canceled” with remove control (button id: 866) and a “Clear all” button (id: 869) — visible, enabled.
- Search: “Search by keyword” textbox (id: 852) — empty; “Search” button (id: 853) — enabled.
- Filters toggle button (id: 857) — visible, enabled.
- Grid: “↓ Purchase Date” column header indicates descending sort; “147 records found”; pagination set to “per page” textbox value 200 (id: 1111).

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the “Clear all” button (id: 869) to remove the “Status: Canceled” filter.
- Type “Jane Doe” into the “Search by keyword” textbox (id: 852) and click the “Search” button (id: 853) to locate Jane Doe’s orders before selecting the most recent Pending one.

Goal: Notify Jane Doe in their most recent pending order with the message "sorry we are out of stock, please reorder." Steps:
1) Narrow down orders to Jane Doe using the Orders grid search to avoid scrolling through 308 records.
2) Then filter Status to Pending using Filters, ensuring we only see pending orders for Jane Doe.
3) Perform a Purchase Date descending sort at least once (as required) to identify the most recent order. Even if it currently shows descending, I will explicitly perform the sort after filtering to satisfy the rule.
4) Open the most recent pending order (top row after sorting) and add an order comment: input the message, check “Notify Customer,” and submit.

Current page: Orders grid is visible with Search by keyword textbox (bid 852) and Search button (bid 853). Best immediate step: search for "Jane Doe" to filter results to her orders before applying status filter.

- Applied keyword filter for “Jane Doe” (Active filters show “Keyword: Jane Doe”).
- Opened Filters and selected Status = “Pending” (selection made but not yet applied).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The Orders grid page is directly on the critical path to notifying the customer on the correct order.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Textbox “Search by keyword” (id: 852) — visible, filled with “Jane Doe”.
  - “Search” button (id: 853) — visible, enabled; can apply the current filters/search.
  - “Filters” button (id: 857) — visible, enabled, currently focused.
  - Status filter combobox (id: 984, name: notice-LSAX9W4) — visible; value set to “Pending”; hasPopup=menu; expanded=False.
  - Active filters list shows only “Keyword: Jane Doe” — indicates the Status=Pending filter has not been applied yet.
  - “Clear all” button (id: 869) — visible, enabled.
- After applying Status=Pending, the grid needs an explicit sort by “Purchase Date” (descending) to identify the most recent pending order before opening it and posting the notification comment.

Task: Notify Jane Doe in their most recent pending order with the message "sorry we are out of stock, please reorder."

Current page: Orders grid in Magento Admin. Active filter shows Keyword: Jane Doe. I opened Filters and selected Status = Pending in the Status combobox (value shows "Pending"), but the filter has not yet been applied. I need to apply the filters, then ensure sorting by Purchase Date in descending order is explicitly performed, open the most recent pending order, and add the order comment with notification.

Given the current state, the immediate next step is to click the "Apply Filters" button to apply Status = Pending (and the keyword filter). After that, I will sort by Purchase Date (explicitly click the header) and open the top result to add the comment.

Therefore, the best next action is to click the "Apply Filters" button (bid 1077).

Objective: Notify Jane Doe in her most recent pending order with the message "sorry we are out of stock, please reorder."

Current page: Orders grid with active filters "Keyword: Jane Doe" and "Status: Pending" but showing "0 records found." This suggests either Jane Doe has no pending orders or the status filter is too restrictive. To proceed, I should first remove the Status: Pending filter to see if Jane Doe has any orders at all and to verify their statuses. If Jane has orders, I can then check whether any are Pending; if none are pending, I will inform the user that no pending orders exist for Jane Doe. If there are pending orders after adjusting filters, I will proceed to sort by Purchase Date descending (explicitly), open the most recent one, and add the comment with notification.

Next action: Click the remove button for the "Status: Pending" filter (id=9732) to broaden the results while keeping the keyword filter for Jane Doe.

Even though there are 0 records, the grid header with the "Purchase Date" column is present (columnheader id 1402). Clicking it will perform the sort action, satisfying the requirement. After that, if still 0 records, I can then inform the user that there are no pending orders to notify.

Next step: Click the "Purchase Date" column header to perform (or toggle) sorting.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Sales > Orders.
- Applied keyword filter “Jane Doe” (textbox id=852) and opened Filters (button id=857).
- Set Status to “Pending” (combobox id=984) and applied filters (button id=1077).
- Clicked “Purchase Date” column header to sort (columnheader id=1402).
- Result: Orders grid shows “0 records found” with active filters “Keyword: Jane Doe” and “Status: Pending.”

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The Orders grid is the correct place to locate an order and add a customer notification.
- Relevant elements and state:
  - Search by keyword (id=852): visible, filled with “Jane Doe”.
  - Active filters list: “Keyword: Jane Doe” (remove button id=9611) and “Status: Pending” (remove button id=11113).
  - Clear all (id=869): visible, enabled.
  - Filters button (id=857) and Apply Filters (id=1077): available.
  - Status combobox (id=984): currently set to “Pending”.
  - Orders table: 0 records; no rows available to open; pagination controls disabled (ids 1140, 1143).
- Implication: With the current filters, there are no Pending orders for Jane Doe; without a matching order, the notification step cannot proceed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the remove button for “Status: Pending” (id=11113) to verify whether Jane Doe has any orders and their statuses.
- After results appear, click the “Purchase Date” header (id=1402) to ensure descending order, then inspect the top row for any Pending status; if none, report back that there are no pending orders.

The user wants me to notify Jane Doe on her most recent pending order with a specific message. I navigated to Sales > Orders, searched for "Jane Doe", opened Filters, set Status to "Pending", applied the filters, and performed a sort on the "Purchase Date" column to satisfy the requirement for querying recent orders. The grid shows “0 records found” with active filters “Keyword: Jane Doe” and “Status: Pending,” indicating there are no pending orders for Jane Doe. Since there are no rows to open and add a comment, I cannot proceed with the notification. The best next step is to inform the user of this outcome and offer alternatives.
