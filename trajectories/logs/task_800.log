The user wants to create a new group named "x-lab" and add specified members. From the current GitLab dashboard, the most direct way to start creating a group is via the "Create new..." link in the top navigation, which typically opens a dropdown with options like "New project" and "New group". The page already has a "New project" button, but we need "New group", which should be under "Create new...".

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal (creating the group before adding members).
- textbox “Group name” (id=261): required; visible; value “x-lab”; filled.
- textbox “Group URL” (id=271): required; visible; currently shows “x-lab3”; focused; flagged invalid (alert: “Group path is unavailable. Path has been replaced with a suggested available path.”).

- button “Create group” (visible text): visible and enabled.
- button “Dismiss” (id=505): visible; optional informational banner.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Resolve the invalid URL: accept the suggested unique slug by ensuring the “Group URL” textbox (id=271) contains an available value (e.g., leave “x-lab3” or type a unique value), then confirm the error clears.
- Click the button labeled “Create group” to submit the form and proceed to add members.

The user’s goal is to create a new group named “x-lab” and then add specific members. I’m on the “Create group” form. The Group name is already set to “x-lab”. The Group URL was auto-suggested to “x-lab3” because “x-lab” path is unavailable. I attempted to change the URL back to “x-lab,” but given the earlier alert about unavailability, it may still be invalid. The most efficient next step is to try submitting via “Create group.” If the submission fails due to an unavailable path, I can then accept the suggested available path (like x-lab3) and resubmit. After successful creation, I’ll proceed to the Members tab to invite the specified users. Therefore, I will click the “Create group” button now.

The goal is to add specified members to the newly created group “x-lab.” I’m on the group’s overview page (URL shows /x-lab3), and there’s a prominent banner with a blue “Invite your colleagues” button, which is intended for inviting members to this group. This is the most direct path to open the invite dialog where I can add users by their usernames. Therefore, the next best action is to click the “Invite your colleagues” button to start inviting the listed users (JonasVautherin, dilipchandima, dawiss1337, bmyun, DCMJY).

The goal is to finish adding all specified members to the newly created “x-lab” group. The “Invite members” modal is open, and four users (Jonas Vautherin, Dileepa Chandima, Davis, 윤보미) are already added as tokens. The textbox currently contains “DCMJY,” and a suggestion menu shows “DCMJY DCMJY” (menuitem bid 1653). To include this final user, I need to select the suggestion so it becomes a token in the invite list. After this, I will be able to click Invite to send all invitations. Therefore, the next best single action is to click the suggestion for DCMJY.
