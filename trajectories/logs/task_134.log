The user asks for the number of commits made by "kilian" to the a11yproject on 3/1/2023. On the GitLab dashboard, I see a project named "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com." This likely corresponds to the target repository. To answer the question, I should:
1) Navigate to the project page for "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com".
2) Go to the repository's Commits view.
3) Locate commits on 2023-03-01 and filter by author "kilian" (or visually scan and count if filters are limited).
The first step is to open the project by clicking its link. I will click the link with bid [394] labeled "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com".

✅ Current Progress: Arrived at the a11yproject.com project page on GitLab (project overview). This positions us to access the repository’s commit history.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to the goal of determining how many commits “kilian” made on 3/1/2023. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link “2,320 Commits” (id: 687) — visible and enabled; should open the repository’s commit history.
- Link “Repository” (id: 297) — visible and enabled; repository navigation that can also lead to commits.
- Textbox “Search GitLab” (id: 146) — visible; global search (less direct for filtering commits within this repo).

Recommended path is to open the commits view via “2,320 Commits” (id: 687), then filter or scan by author “kilian” and date 2023-03-01.

- Button labeled “Author” (id: 800), hasPopup=menu, expanded=False — visible and enabled; use this to filter commits by author “kilian.”
- Button labeled “main” (id: 588), hasPopup=menu, expanded=False — visible; branch filter (already showing main).
- Searchbox “Search by message” (id: 842) — visible and empty; not suited for author filtering.
- Commit list sections show date headers (e.g., “01 Mar, 2023 1 commit”) with individual commit entries that include author names and commit metadata; currently not filtered.
