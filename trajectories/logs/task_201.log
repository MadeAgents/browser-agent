The user asks for the customer name of the earliest fraud suspect order. In Magento, "Suspected Fraud" is an order status. The most direct way to find individual orders and their customers is via the Sales > Orders grid, where I can filter by Status = Suspected Fraud and then sort by purchase date ascending to identify the earliest order, and extract the customer name.

From the dashboard, I should navigate to the Sales section first. The top navigation includes a "SALES" link. Clicking that should take me to the Sales area, likely defaulting to Orders. Once there, I will filter by the "Suspected Fraud" status and proceed with sorting by date ascending. For now, the next best step is to click the SALES link.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal. To find the earliest fraud-suspect order, the status must be filtered to “Suspected Fraud” and the earliest row identified by Purchase Date.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - button “Filters” [845] — visible/enabled; opens filter controls.
  - Active filter chip “Status: Complete” with remove button [854]; “Clear all” [857] to remove all filters.
  - column header “Purchase Date” [1390] — currently shows “↑” (ascending).
  - column header “Bill-to Name” [1392] — will contain the customer name to report.
  - column header “Status” [1400] — shows each order’s status after filtering.
  - “Search by keyword” textbox [840] and “Search” button [841] — not required for status filtering.
- Note: With “Status: Complete” applied, “Suspected Fraud” orders are excluded. You’ll need to remove the current filter and set Status to “Suspected Fraud” before reading the earliest row’s Bill-to Name.
