🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward the goal. The left slide-out Sales menu is visible and expanded. Relevant interactive elements for progressing:
- link “Orders” (id [168]): visible and enabled.
- link “Invoices” (id [171]): visible and enabled (not needed for the goal).
- link “Shipments” (id [174]): visible and enabled (not needed for the goal).
The focused top-level navigation item is “SALES” (link [156]). The main content is the Dashboard; no order filters are present yet. To look up orders on hold, the next necessary step is to navigate to the Orders grid via the “Orders” link.

The user asked to look up orders that are on hold. From the Dashboard, I previously opened the SALES menu, which is now expanded on the left sidebar showing options like Orders, Invoices, Shipments, etc. To access the orders grid where I can filter by status (e.g., "On Hold"), the next logical step is to click the "Orders" link in the SALES menu. This will navigate to the Orders listing page where I can apply the appropriate status filter. Only one action is permitted per step, so I will click "Orders" now.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the Sales > Orders grid in Magento Admin. The orders list is displayed.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to the goal. However, the active filter is “Status: Complete,” which does not match the goal (“On Hold”).
Relevant interactive elements:
- button “Filters” [857]: visible and enabled.
- active filter chip “Status: Complete” with remove button [866]: visible; removing will clear the “Complete” filter.
- button “Clear all” [869]: visible and enabled; clears all active filters.
- textbox “Search by keyword” [852]: visible, currently empty; button “Search” [853] enabled.
- table with column “Status” [1412]: rows listed; “153 records found” shown.
- button “Actions” [1082], button “Export” [837], button “Columns” [760]: visible (not required for the goal).
- pagination: “per page” textbox [1111] value=200; navigation arrows [1140], [1143] disabled; spinbutton “of 1” [1141] indicates a single page.

The current filter shows only “Complete” orders; to look up on-hold orders, the status filter needs to be changed to “On Hold.” No deviation detected.

- Opened the Filters panel and set Status to “On Hold.”
- Applied filters; the grid now shows “Active filters: Status: On Hold” and reports “0 records found.” ✅ Task completed: On-hold orders view is displayed (no matching orders currently).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is the Magento Admin Orders grid, which is directly on the critical path for looking up on-hold orders.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Active filter chip “Status: On Hold” [7422] with remove button [7425]: visible, enabled.
  - “Clear all” filters button [869]: visible, enabled.
  - “Filters” button [857]: visible, enabled (to adjust filters).
  - “Search by keyword” textbox [852]: visible, enabled, empty; “Search” button [853]: visible, enabled.
  - Results area shows “0 records found” and the orders table [1380] with headers; pagination controls [1140], [1143] are disabled, per-page textbox [1111] value='200' visible, enabled.
- Conclusion: The Orders grid is correctly filtered to “On Hold,” but there are currently no records matching this status.
