The user wants the total cost of their latest complete order. According to the Task Tips, I should navigate through My Account > My Orders to find order details. The page indicates the user is logged in (“Welcome, Emma Lopez!”) and shows a “My Account” link at the top (element [227]). The next logical step is to click “My Account” to access account-related pages, then proceed to “My Orders.” I will click the “My Account” link.

 <think>
The user wants the total cost of their latest complete order. On the current "My Account" page, the "Recent Orders" table displays multiple orders with their statuses. The most recent statuses are Canceled and Pending for May 2023 entries. The only row marked "Complete" is dated 3/11/23 with an "Order Total" of $65.32. Since the request is specifically for the latest complete order, that row qualifies. Based on the instruction to return just the decimal when asked how much is spent, I will provide "65.32" without additional text.
