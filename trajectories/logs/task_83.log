The user wants the total duration for a two-leg trip: walk from Carnegie Mellon University to Apple Store Shadyside, then drive to Starbucks on Craig Street. On OpenStreetMap, I should use the built-in directions feature (the two arrows icon / "Find directions between two points") to compute routes. Since the website generally handles one mode at a time, I'll compute two separate routes: first with walking mode from CMU to Apple Store Shadyside, record the duration, then switch to driving mode from Apple Store Shadyside to Starbucks on Craig Street, record duration, and then sum them for the final answer. The first step is to open the directions panel by clicking "Find directions between two points".

✅ Current Progress: No progress made yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap with the Directions panel visible, which is on the critical path to compute walking and driving durations. Relevant elements:
- Mode radios: 
  - Car [173] (checked, enabled, visible)
  - Bicycle [176] (unchecked, enabled, visible)
  - Foot [179] (unchecked, enabled, visible)
- Combobox “Directions services” [182] value='OSRM' (enabled, collapsed)
- Text inputs:
  - “From” textbox [194] (empty, enabled, visible)
  - “To” textbox [199] (empty, enabled, visible)
- “Reverse Directions” button [200] (enabled, visible)
- “Close” [187] (enabled; would hide the panel — not needed)

To achieve the goal, first compute a Foot route from “Carnegie Mellon University” to “Apple Store Shadyside,” note the duration, then switch to Car and compute a route from “Apple Store Shadyside” to “Starbucks on Craig Street,” and sum durations.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the radio labeled Foot [179].
- Type “Carnegie Mellon University” into the “From” textbox [194] and “Apple Store Shadyside” into the “To” textbox [199] to generate the walking route.

The user asks for the duration of a two-leg trip: 1) walk from Carnegie Mellon University to Apple Store Shadyside, and 2) drive to Starbucks on Craig Street. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open and currently shows the first leg (walking) with OSRM foot routing selected and a computed result: Distance 1.4km, Time 0:18. So the walking duration is 0:18.

Next, I need to compute the driving duration from Apple Store Shadyside to Starbucks on Craig Street. To do that, I must switch the routing mode to Car and then set the origin and destination accordingly. The interface shows radio buttons for modes with labels; the Car label [174] is available. Clicking it should switch the mode to Car. After switching, I will use the Reverse Directions button to swap "From" and "To" so that Apple Store becomes the origin, then update the destination to “Starbucks on Craig Street,” and finally compute the route (likely by pressing Enter in the To field). The immediate next best step is to switch the mode to Car by clicking the Car label.

The user asks for the total duration of a two-leg trip: (1) walk from Carnegie Mellon University to Apple Store Shadyside, and (2) drive from Apple Store Shadyside to Starbucks on Craig Street. I’m using the OpenStreetMap directions panel. The current UI shows:
- Mode radios with Car checked (173 checked true).
- From [194]: Apple Store, Walnut Street, Shadyside...
- To [199]: Starbucks, Craig Street, Pittsburgh (focused).
- A results panel shows Distance 1.5km and Time 0:03 with step list that appears to end at Forbes Avenue near CMU, which suggests the route may not yet be updated to Starbucks on Craig Street.

Given that the To field is already filled with "Starbucks, Craig Street, Pittsburgh" but the step list suggests an older destination, the route likely hasn’t recomputed. On this site, pressing Enter in the To field typically triggers recalculation. I already have the walking leg time from earlier (0:18) saved in my reasoning; now I need the correct car leg time to Starbucks on Craig Street. The best next step is to press Enter on the To field [199] to compute the correct car route and update the time.
