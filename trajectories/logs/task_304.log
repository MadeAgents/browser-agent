The user asks for the number of commits Eric made between Feb 2023 and May 2023 in the current GitLab project. To find this, I should navigate to the commits list where filters for author and date range may be available. On the current page, I see a metrics section with a clickable link "2,320 Commits" (bid 687). Clicking this should bring me to the commits page. From there, I can look for filtering options (author filter for Eric and possibly date filters), or manually review the commit list around the specified dates.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is directly relevant to the goal (counting commits for a specific author within a date range). Key interactive elements:
- [800] button “Author”, hasPopup='menu', expanded=False — visible; used to filter commits by author (needed to isolate “Eric”).
- [842] searchbox “Search by message” — visible and currently empty; not essential for author/date filtering.
- [588] button “main”, hasPopup='menu', expanded=False — visible; indicates the branch filter (currently set to main).
- [847] list — visible commit list with date headers like “14 Mar, 2023” and per-day commit counts; includes entries spanning early 2023. Scrolling may be required to cover Feb through May 2023.
The page appears on the correct path to determine the commit count for Eric in the specified time window.

The current page is the Commits list for the repository and shows grouped dates around Feb and Mar 2023, including entries authored by Eric Bailey.

We need to count how many commits Eric made between Feb 2023 and May 2023. The current page is the repository’s Commits list on the main branch. The Author filter dropdown is already open (expanded=True), and within it there is a searchbox labeled “Search” (bid 812). The menu currently lists a few authors but not Eric yet. To efficiently narrow down the commit list to only Eric’s commits, the next logical step is to use the author search box to find and select “Eric Bailey”. This aligns with the tip to use filters rather than manually scanning through all commits. Therefore, I will type “Eric” into the author search field to bring up Eric Bailey in the menu for selection next.

We're on the Commits page of the repository, and an Author filter dropdown is open with "Eric" typed in the search box, but this won't easily give a total over a date range without scrolling/pagination. A better approach per the provided tips is to use the "Contributors" tab, which shows contributors and their number of commits and typically provides date range filters.

  - [613] SvgRoot “Number of commits” — time-series chart visible; likely the control for scoping the date range (exact interaction not shown in AX tree but it is the prominent timeline on this page).
  - Contributors list (multiple per-user panels with names and sparklines) — requires scrolling to locate “Eric” (e.g., “Eric Bailey”); specific node IDs for individual entries aren’t listed in the truncated AX tree.
  - [604] link “History” — navigates back to the commits list if needed.
- Next actions on this page should involve narrowing the date range (Feb 2023 to May 2023) via the chart if interactive, and then identifying Eric’s contributor panel to read the commit count within that range. The page appears relevant and no errors or blockers are evident.

Task: Determine how many commits Eric made between Feb 2023 and May 2023 in the current GitLab project. I’m on the Contributors page, which summarizes commits and often allows time-range selection via an interactive timeline. However, precisely counting for a specific date range is usually easier on the Commits (History) page with author filtering.

Analysis of current page:
- The page shows “Contributors · The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com · GitLab” with a “Commits to main” section and many per-author panels. Two entries for “Eric Bailey” exist (different emails), but the listed “X commits” values appear to be total across all time, not scoped to a date range unless the top timeline is adjusted. Manipulating the timeline might be complex (drag/zoom interactions) and may not present a straightforward numeric total.

Plan:
- Navigate to the "History" (commits list) page via the “History” link visible on this Contributors page.
- There, use the Author filter to select “Eric Bailey” so only his commits are shown.
- Then examine the commit list around Feb–May 2023 and count the commits in that range. If the list groups by dates (common on GitLab), I can count entries under headers for Feb, Mar, Apr, and May 2023.

Next best single action: Click the "History" link to go to the commits list where I can filter by author and find the count within the date range.

✅ Current Progress:
- Arrived on the repository’s Commits page for branch “main.”
- Opened the “Author” filter dropdown to begin narrowing results to the target author.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is directly on the critical path to the goal; it lists commits by date and supports filtering by author.
- Relevant interactive elements (visible and enabled unless noted):
  - [588] button “main” — branch selector; currently set to main.
  - [800] button “Author” — author filter; expanded=True (menu open).
  - [803] menu “Author” — focused; contains:
    - [812] searchbox “Search” — editable; use to find the target author (“Eric”).
    - [815] menuitem “Any Author” — selectable.
    - Additional author menu items (e.g., “Byte Blaze”, “Roshan Jossy”, “The A11Y Project”) — selectable.
- The commit list shows date-grouped entries (e.g., March 2023 visible on the page). Filtering the author to “Eric” and then reviewing commits between Feb 2023 and May 2023 will enable an accurate count. No off-track behavior detected.

The user asks: “How many commits did Eric make between Feb 2023 and May 2023?” I’m on the Commits page for the repository’s main branch. The page displays commits grouped by dates around February and March 2023, among others. To count Eric’s commits in that date range, the best first step is to filter the author to “Eric” so only Eric’s commits are shown. The “Author” dropdown is already open (expanded). Inside it, there’s a search box (bid 812) that allows narrowing to a specific author. Currently, the listed authors don’t include Eric, so I should type “Eric” into the search field to bring up “Eric Bailey” as a selectable option. Once “Eric Bailey” appears, I’ll select it, and then I can count the commits within the target months (Feb–May 2023), possibly navigating to newer pages for April and May if needed. The immediate next action is to fill “Eric” into the author search field.

- The author filter has not been applied yet (only searched), so the list still contains non-Eric commits. To count Eric’s commits between Feb–May 2023, the author must be selected from the menu, then review the date-grouped sections (scroll/paginate as needed) covering Feb, Mar, Apr, and May 2023.

The goal is to count Eric’s commits between Feb 2023 and May 2023. I’m currently on the Commits page with the Author filter dropdown open and “Eric” typed into the search box, but I don’t see a selectable “Eric Bailey” menu item in the accessibility tree. Also, the visible commit list presently covers Feb and Mar 2023 but not Apr or May, and I cannot scroll. To get a precise count across a broader date range, the Contributors tab typically provides a date-range control and per-author commit totals. From the left sidebar, there is a “Repository” link, which leads to a page with tabs like “Commits,” “Branches,” and “Contributors.” Navigating to “Repository” is the next step toward accessing the “Contributors” tab where I can set the date range (Feb–May 2023) and find Eric Bailey’s commit count directly.

✅ Current Progress:

- No filtering or counting of commits has been completed. Previously opened the commits page, but the workflow has navigated back to Files.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This Files view is adjacent but not on the critical path to counting commits. You need the Commits/History page to filter by author and date.
- Relevant interactive elements on this page:
  - [617] button “main” (branch selector) — visible, enabled.
  - [867] link “History” — visible, enabled; leads to the commits list.
  - [869] link “Find file” — visible, enabled (not relevant to the goal).
  - [872] link “Web IDE” — visible, enabled (not relevant).
  - [890] link “Clone” — visible, enabled (not relevant).
- Indicator text shows “Eric Bailey authored” for a specific commit, but this does not provide the total count between Feb–May 2023.
- You are slightly off-track: to count commits by Eric, you should be on the commits history page with author/date filtering.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link with text “History” [867] to open the commits list where you can filter by author and count commits in the Feb–May 2023 range.

The user asks for the count of commits authored by Eric between February 2023 and May 2023 on the current GitLab repository. We are on the Commits page (main branch) with a chronological list grouped by dates. The visible range includes February and March 2023 and then older months (January 2023 and earlier). There are no entries for April or May 2023 at the top of the list, which implies there were no commits in those months within this visible context (the list starts at March 14, 2023). 

I will count only commits where the author link is “Eric Bailey” within the February and March 2023 sections:

- March 2023:
  - Mar 14: 2 commits (both Eric Bailey)
  - Mar 12: 1 commit (Eric Bailey)
  - Mar 7: 1 commit (Eric Bailey; the other on that date is by Cooper Hollmaier)
  - Mar 5: 0 (Kilian Valkhof)
  - Mar 2: 2 commits (both Eric Bailey; third is Philip Wong)
  => March total = 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 6

- February 2023:
  - Feb 28: 2 commits (both Eric Bailey; one other by Philip Wong)
  - Feb 14: 2 commits (both Eric Bailey)
  - Feb 13: 0 (authors are Saptak Sengupta, Cooper Hollmaier)
  - Feb 12: 2 commits (two Eric Bailey; one other by Kyrre Gjerstad)
  - Feb 5: 1 commit (Eric Bailey)
  - Feb 2: 1 commit (Eric Bailey)
  => February total = 2 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8

- April 2023: no entries visible on the page
- May 2023: no entries visible on the page

Combined total from Feb through May (inclusive) = 8 (Feb) + 6 (Mar) + 0 (Apr) + 0 (May) = 14.

Given the current page scope and lack of April/May entries, the best answer is 14. I will report the number with a brief breakdown for clarity.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the repository’s Commits page for branch “main.”
- Manually counted Eric Bailey’s commits in February and March 2023 from the visible list and provided an answer (14).
- No author filter applied; April and May 2023 were not verified on the page.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to the goal (it lists commits by date and author).
- The visible commit list shows sections for March 2023 and February 2023 with multiple entries authored by “Eric Bailey.”
- April and May 2023 are not visible on the current screen; since the list appears chronological, those months are likely above (newer). Without filtering or scrolling to those months, counts for April/May were not confirmed.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - [801] button “Author” (hasPopup menu, expanded=False) — use to filter to “Eric Bailey”; currently not applied.
  - [589] button “main” (branch selector, expanded=False) — correct branch selected.
  - [843] searchbox “Search by message” — optional; not needed for author filter.
  - Commit list section headers (e.g., [849] “14 Mar, 2023 — 2 commits”) and individual commit entries with author links (e.g., [865] link “Eric Bailey”) — visible and enabled.
- The answer was given without validating April and May 2023; risk of an incomplete count.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button [801] “Author” to open the author filter, then use the dropdown’s search to select “Eric Bailey” so only Eric’s commits are shown.
- After filtering, scroll up in the commit list to locate the “May 2023” and “Apr 2023” headers and count Eric’s commits in those sections to confirm or correct the total.
