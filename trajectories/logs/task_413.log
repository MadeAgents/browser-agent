🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to changing the project’s license, as the next step is to access the repository file tree and locate or add a LICENSE file.

  - link 'Repository' [297] (visible/enabled): Navigate to the file tree to open or create the LICENSE file.
  - Breadcrumbs: 'Byte Blaze' [598] and 'a11y-syntax-highlighting' [601] (visible) for navigation context.
  - Non-blocking alerts are present (e.g., 'Add SSH key' [578]), but they do not affect editing files via the web UI.

The task is to change the repository’s license to a copyleft license that mandates all copies and derivative works remain under the same license. A common choice is GNU GPL (e.g., GPLv3). I’m currently on the repository overview page for byteblaze/a11y-syntax-highlighting, and I can see the file list which includes a LICENSE file (row with link 'LICENSE' [961]). To modify the license, I should open this LICENSE file first. From there, I will look for an Edit option to replace its content with a GPL template (GitLab often provides license templates in the file editor).

✅ Current Progress: Opened the LICENSE file in the Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting repository and confirmed the current license text is MIT (permissive, not copyleft).

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to changing the license. The LICENSE file is displayed with MIT License content. To switch to a copyleft license (e.g., GPL-3.0), the file must be edited and committed.

The user's goal is to change the repository's license to a copyleft license that mandates all copies and derivative works be under the same license. The current LICENSE file shows "MIT License," which is permissive and does not meet the copyleft requirement. We need to edit and replace the LICENSE with a copyleft license, such as GNU GPL v3. To make file changes via GitLab, the typical flow is to open the file in an editor. On this page, I see a clear "Open in Web IDE" link [1452], which will allow editing the LICENSE and committing directly to main (as per the task tips, default to main unless instructed otherwise). The "Toggle dropdown" likely contains an "Edit" option, but "Open in Web IDE" is the most straightforward editing interface.

Note: Current settings would commit to a new branch with an MR, which delays applying the license change to the default branch.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click radio “Commit to main branch” (id [2867]).
- Click the “Commit” button (id [2889]) to finalize the license change directly on main.

✅ Current Progress: Inserted GNU General Public License v3.0 text into LICENSE via the Web IDE; diff shows MIT removed and GPLv3 added. Commit panel is open with message “Update LICENSE.” No commit has been made yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page (GitLab Web IDE on LICENSE) is on the critical path to changing the repository’s license.
- Editor content shows GPLv3 text (textbox “Editor content…” [5289], filled). The removed MIT text appears in the diff (textbox [2943]).
- Commit controls:
  - Commit Message textbox [2861]: “Update LICENSE” (filled).
  - Radio “Commit to main branch” [2867]: unchecked.
  - Radio “Create a new branch” [2874]: checked; branch name textbox [2881] = “byteblaze-main-patch-08233”.
  - Checkbox “Start a new merge request” [2885]: checked.
  - “Commit” button [2889]: visible/enabled.
Current settings would create a branch and MR instead of applying the license change directly to main.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click radio “Commit to main branch” (id [2867]).
- Click the “Commit” button (id [2889]) to finalize the license change directly on main.

 <think>
The user wants the repository license to mandate that all copies and derivative works be under the same license. I already inserted the GNU General Public License v3.0 text into the LICENSE file via the Web IDE, which satisfies the copyleft requirement. Now I need to commit this change. The commit panel is open, but it’s currently set to "Create a new branch" and "Start a new merge request". Per the task tips, I should commit directly to the main branch. I attempted to click the radio button "Commit to main branch" [2867], but the click was intercepted by the label element [2868]. To resolve this, I should click the label associated with that radio option, which typically toggles the radio selection. After successfully switching to "Commit to main branch", I can proceed to click Commit in a subsequent step.
