The user asks: “Tell me the full names of the repositories where I made contributions and they got more than 100 stars.” On GitLab, to find highly starred repositories and verify whether the user (Byte Blaze) contributed, the most efficient approach is:
- Go to Explore to view repositories and use the “Most Stars” view (per tips #11).
- For each repository with >100 stars, open it and check the Contributors tab (per tip #7) to see if “Byte Blaze” appears.
The current “Projects · Dashboard” shows only a subset of the user’s projects and the star counts there look small; exploring “Most Stars” will let me quickly find candidates and then validate contribution status. I will click the Explore link now to access that section.

✅ Current Progress: No progress made yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is “Projects” with the “Topics” tab selected and shows “There are no topics to show.” This view is not on the critical path to identifying repositories you contributed to with >100 stars. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link “Byte Blaze” [180] (header, visible/enabled) — likely leads to the user profile where contributed projects can be found.
- Link “Explore” [240] (visible/enabled) — navigates to global project discovery, not filtered to your contributions.
- Tabs: “Yours 14” [234], “Starred 3” [237], “Topics” [242] (current), and a searchbox “Filter by name” [245] (empty). These do not directly list projects you have contributed to across GitLab.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link with text “Byte Blaze” [180] to access your profile, then proceed to the contributed projects section to identify repositories and check their star counts.
- Alternatively, click link “Explore” [240] to browse projects and verify contributor lists, but the profile route is more direct for your contributions.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path: it lists projects you’ve contributed to and shows star counts per project.
- Searchbox “Filter by name” [269] — visible, empty, enabled.
- Tab “All” [307] — visible, enabled, appears selected; “Personal” [309] is available.
- Project links (each opens the project page):
  - “Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting” [320] — visible, enabled; star count shown as link “1” [344] (below 100).
  - “Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club” [357] — visible, enabled; star count link “4” [381] (below 100).
  - “The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com” [394] — visible, enabled; star count link “40” [418] (below 100).
- Role labels confirm contribution status:
  - “Owner” appears for several Byte Blaze projects.
  - “Maintainer” appears for “The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com”.
All listed items currently show star counts below 100. To complete the goal, the agent needs to check the entire “Yours” list (scroll) and, if necessary, open individual project pages to verify star counts; none in the visible portion exceed 100.
