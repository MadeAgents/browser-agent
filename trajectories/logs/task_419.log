The user wants to set their GitLab status to "Enjoying life." According to the provided tips, to set the status I should click the profile button in the top-right corner (next to the Help/question mark icon) and then select "edit status." On the current page (Projects dashboard), I see in the top navigation bar a list item with a link labeled "Byte Blaze" which is likely the profile/avatar menu trigger (Accessibility Tree node [201]). The next logical step is to click this "Byte Blaze" link to open the user menu where the "Edit status" option should be available. After the menu opens, I will then look for and click "Edit status," and subsequently fill in the status text. For now, the single next action is to open the profile menu.

  - Close control “X” (marker [1155]) — visible.
- The modal still appears open in the current view, so the status may not have been saved yet.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the button labeled “Set status” (marker [1208]) to save the status.
- If the modal closes, verify by opening the profile menu and checking that the status shows “Enjoying life.”; if it remains open, look for validation messages and try again.
