The initial search for “Western Pennsylvania Hospital Heliport” returned “No results found” on OpenStreetMap, likely because the feature may be indexed under a slightly different name or requires geographic context.

The user wants the coordinates in decimal degrees (DD) for Western Pennsylvania Hospital Heliport using the current OpenStreetMap page. The "Share" panel is already open and shows:
- Link field with URL encoding the map center: https://www.openstreetmap.org/?#map=19/40.460761/-79.947003
- Geo URI: geo:40.460761,-79.947003?z=19

These reflect the current map center, which is positioned on the West Penn Hospital Heliport marker. Therefore, the coordinates are latitude 40.460761 and longitude -79.947003. The best next action is to send these coordinates to the user in DD format, concisely.
