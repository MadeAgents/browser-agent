The user wants to know when they last ordered toothpaste. Since we're already logged in (it shows "Welcome, Emma Lopez!"), the most direct route is to check the order history. On this site, the usual path is My Account → My Orders. From the current homepage, the "My Account" link is visible in the top banner (accessibility id [227]). Clicking it should take us to the account dashboard where we can access order history and then look for an order containing toothpaste. Therefore, the next step is to click "My Account".

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “My Account” dashboard where the “Recent Orders” table is visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is directly relevant to the goal. The “Recent Orders” section shows multiple past orders with columns for Order #, Date, Ship To, Order Total, Status, and Action. In the Action column, there are visible “View Order” links (e.g., markers such as [1490], [1494], [1498], [1502], [1506]) that appear enabled and clickable; these are essential to open order details and verify whether toothpaste was included, and to identify the most recent purchase date. A left-side navigation menu also includes a “My Orders” link (visible text) that should lead to the full order history if needed. The “Recently Ordered” widget is present but does not clearly show toothpaste, so order detail pages are the correct path to confirm the last toothpaste order.

The user asked for the last time they ordered toothpaste. The My Account dashboard is open and shows a “Recent Orders” table with five orders dated 12/22/25 and 12/18/25. To determine which order contains toothpaste, I should open the details of likely candidates and check the items. The $18.89 order (#000000201) dated 12/22/25 looks like a plausible single-item personal care purchase (potentially toothpaste), so the most efficient next step is to click its “View Order” link to see the order contents and confirm whether toothpaste was included. If it is, that would establish the date as 12/22/25; if not, I will check the next recent order. I will click the “View Order” link for order #000000201 (accessibility id [1502]).

The goal is to find the most recent order that contains toothpaste. I’m on the “My Orders” page, which shows a table of orders with dates, totals, and “View Order” links. We already ruled out the two most recent orders dated 12/22/25 (#000000202 and #000000201) for toothpaste. The next most recent date is 12/18/25, but those orders have large totals ($528.34, $255.80, $231.54), which are less likely to be a single toothpaste purchase. The following date is 12/16/25 with smaller totals: $15.27 (#000000197) and $29.99 (#000000196), which are more plausible for toothpaste. To confirm, I should open the order details to check the items. I will start with the most recent of these smaller orders, #000000197, by clicking its “View Order” link (bid 1434).

- Returned to the “My Orders” list.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current “My Orders” page is directly on the critical path to determine the last toothpaste purchase.
- The Orders table shows rows with “Action” links to open details:
  - link “View Order” [1379] for Order #000000202 (Date: 12/22/25) — visible/enabled.
  - link “View Order” [1390] for Order #000000201 (Date: 12/22/25) — visible/enabled.
  - link “View Order” [1401] for Order #000000200 (Date: 12/18/25) — visible/enabled.
  - Additional rows (e.g., #000000199, #000000198, #000000196, etc.) each have visible “View Order” links to inspect contents.
- No off-track behavior detected; continuing to open recent orders from most recent to older to find one containing toothpaste remains appropriate.

The user wants the date of their last toothpaste order. I’m on the “My Orders” page, which lists recent orders with “View Order” links.

To determine if toothpaste was purchased and thus identify the latest date, the best next step is to open #000000198’s details. I will click its “View Order” link.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened Order #000000195 (dated December 16, 2025) and confirmed the item is “Multi Pouch The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild for Nintendo Switch,” not toothpaste.
- Previously checked and ruled out for toothpaste: #000000202, #000000201 (12/22/25), #000000200, #000000199, #000000198 (12/18/25), and #000000197, #000000196 (12/16/25).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is the Order Details view for #000000195, which is on the critical path for identifying the last toothpaste purchase date.
- Key elements visible and relevant for progressing:
  - Link “My Orders” (id 1473) in the left account navigation — visible and enabled; use this to return to the full orders list to inspect earlier orders.
  - Link “Reorder” (id 1363) — visible and enabled; not relevant to determining the date.
  - Link “Print Order” (id 1365) — visible and enabled; not necessary for the goal.
  - Search combobox (id 266) with “Search” button (id 271) currently disabled — not needed for this task.
- No deviation detected; continuing to review earlier orders from the “My Orders” list remains the correct approach.

The user wants the date of their most recent toothpaste order. I’m currently on the details page for Order #000000195 (December 16, 2025), and the item listed is a Nintendo Switch pouch—not toothpaste—so this order doesn’t match. To continue the search, I should return to the full orders list where I can open other nearby orders (#000000194, #000000193, etc.) and inspect their items. The left sidebar includes a “My Orders” link (bid 1466) that will navigate back to the order history. Since the last attempted action (clicking a specific “View Order” link) timed out and I’m not on the orders list right now, the best next step is to click “My Orders” to get back to the list and proceed to check the next candidates.

✅ Current Progress:
- Returned to the “My Orders” list.
- Already inspected and ruled out for toothpaste: #000000202 and #000000201 (12/22/25), #000000200, #000000199, #000000198 (12/18/25), and #000000197, #000000196, #000000195 (12/16/25). None contained toothpaste.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (“My Orders”) is on the critical path to determine the last toothpaste purchase date.
- Relevant interactive elements on this page:
  - Orders table “Orders” with rows showing Order #, Date, Total, Status, and Action.
  - “View Order” links (visible/enabled) for each row, including:
    - Order #000000202 — link “View Order” (id 1379).
    - Order #000000201 — link “View Order” (id 1390).
    - Order #000000200 — link “View Order” (id 1401).
    - Additional “View Order” links are visible for subsequent rows on this page (e.g., orders #000000199, #000000198, #000000197, #000000196, #000000195, #000000194, #000000193), and are enabled.
  - “Reorder” links next to each order (visible/enabled) — not needed for the goal.
  - Pagination indicator “Items 1 to 10 of 50 total” and “Show 10 per page” — suggests older orders are accessible if needed.
- No deviation detected; continuing to open remaining recent orders on this page (e.g., #000000194 and #000000193) to inspect their items is appropriate.

The user wants the date of their most recent toothpaste order. I’m currently on the details page for Order #000000194 (December 16, 2025), and the “Items Ordered” table clearly shows a chandelier, so this is not toothpaste. To continue, I should go back to the orders list to check the remaining uninspected order on this page (#000000193, also dated 12/16/25) and, if necessary, older orders via pagination. The left account navigation includes a “My Orders” link (bid 1466), which will return me to the orders list.
