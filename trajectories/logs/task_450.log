The user wants to set their GitLab profile homepage URL to "a11yproject.contributor.me". According to the provided tips, to edit the profile I should use the profile button on the top-right (next to Help) and then choose "Edit profile." On the current dashboard page, I see in the top navigation a list item with a link labeled "Byte Blaze" (bid 201) which is likely the profile menu trigger. The correct next step is to click this "Byte Blaze" link to open the dropdown menu where I can select "Edit profile." Once in the profile edit page, I will look for the field corresponding to homepage/website and set it to the specified URL, and then save. First, I need to open the profile menu.
