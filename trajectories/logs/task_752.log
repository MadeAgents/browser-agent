Current settings do not yet match the goal: visibility is Public (should be Private), and the README initialization is enabled, which may not be desired for a “blank” repository. The project name still needs to be set to “web_agent.”

The task is to create a private blank repository named "web_agent" using the blank project template. I’m already on the "Create blank project" page, which is the correct template.

Because only a single action is allowed per step, the most logical next action is to fill the "Project name" textbox with "web_agent".

- Project name and slug are set to “web_agent”.
- Clicked the “Private” visibility radio ([319]) to change visibility.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path to the goal (GitLab new project form).
- Key elements and states from the current snapshot:
  - [273] textbox “Project name” — value='web_agent', required, focused.
  - [303] textbox “Project slug” — value='web_agent', required.
  - Visibility radios:
    - [319] “Private …” — clicked in the last action; snapshot shows checked=false (state change not yet confirmed).
    - [327] “Internal …” — checked=false.
    - [335] “Public …” — checked=true in snapshot (not aligned with goal).
  - [346] checkbox “Initialize repository with a README” — checked=true (not blank; conflicts with goal).
  - [283] button “Pick a group or namespace” — hasPopup, expanded=false (namespace selection available).
  - [357] button “Create project” — present and appears actionable.

    - [327] “Internal …” — checked=false.
    - [335] “Public …” — checked=false.
  - [346] checkbox “Initialize repository with a README” — checked=true (must be unchecked to keep the repository blank).
  - [283] button “Pick a group or namespace” — hasPopup, expanded=false (optional).
  - A “Create project” button is visible in the screenshot (state not confirmed in the truncated axtree).
- Conclusion: On the correct form with name and privacy set. The remaining requirement for a blank repository is to uncheck the README initialization, then submit the form.

The goal is to create a private blank repository named "web_agent" using the blank project template. I am on the "Create blank project" page with the project name and slug already set to "web_agent" and the visibility set to Private (radio [319] is checked). To ensure the repository is blank, I need to uncheck "Initialize repository with a README." My last attempt to click the checkbox [346] timed out because the associated label [347] intercepted pointer events. In such cases, clicking the label typically toggles the checkbox. Therefore, the next best action is to click the label [347] to successfully uncheck the README initialization.

- Project name and slug both set to “web_agent”.

- Attempted to create the project, but submission failed due to duplicate name/path in the current namespace.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to the goal, but the form shows blocking errors:

  - [347] checkbox “Initialize repository with a README” — checked=true (this would make the repo non-blank).
  - [358] button “Create project” — visible.
- The errors confirm the chosen namespace currently has a project/path named “web_agent”; to proceed, select a different namespace or adjust the slug, and ensure README is unchecked to keep the repository blank.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click checkbox [347] to uncheck “Initialize repository with a README” so the repo is blank.
- Click the namespace picker button [284] and choose a namespace that does not already contain a project named “web_agent”; then re-submit via the “Create project” button [358].

The goal is to create a private blank repository named “web_agent” using the blank project template.

However, the form shows blocking errors: “Project namespace name has already been taken,” “Name has already been taken,” and “Path has already been taken.” This indicates a collision in the current namespace for the project name/path.

To resolve this, I should change the project’s namespace to one where “web_agent” does not already exist. The Project URL section includes a namespace picker button [284] (hasPopup menu, expanded=False). Opening this dropdown will allow me to select a different namespace. After selecting a different namespace, I can ensure the repository is blank (uncheck README if needed) and then submit. Since only one action is allowed now, the best next step is to open the namespace menu by clicking the picker button.

The goal is to create a private blank repository named "web_agent" using the blank project template. I’m on the “Create blank project” form, which is the correct template. The Project name and slug are already set to "web_agent", and the Visibility Level shows Private is selected, satisfying the privacy requirement. However, the page shows errors: “Project namespace name has already been taken,” “Name has already been taken,” and “Path has already been taken.” This indicates there is already a project named "web_agent" in the currently selected namespace ("byteblaze").

To proceed while keeping the repository name "web_agent," I should change the project’s namespace to a different one where "web_agent" doesn’t exist. The Project URL section has a namespace picker button [284]. The best next step is to open this dropdown to select an alternative namespace (e.g., a group like "coding_friends"). I will click the namespace selector to open the menu; afterward, I can select another namespace and then uncheck the README to keep the repo blank and submit.

  - [284] namespace picker button — visible, hasPopup menu, currently expanded=True with menu [287].
    - Available menu items include: [1077] “crew”, [1081] “crew1”, [1085] “crew2”, [1089] “n-lab”, [1101] “x-lab”, [1105] “x-lab1”, [1109] “x-lab2”, [1073] “coding_friends”, [1115] “byteblaze”, etc.
  - [320] radio “Private …” — checked=true, visible.
  - [347] checkbox “Initialize repository with a README” — currently appears checked (visible in screenshot), which would create a non-blank repository.
- The namespace dropdown is open, so selecting a different namespace is the next required step to resolve the collisions while keeping the name “web_agent”.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click menuitem [1105] “x-lab1” in the open namespace menu to switch to a namespace where “web_agent” may be unique. If collisions persist, try [1077] “crew” or [1089] “n-lab”.
- Uncheck checkbox [347] “Initialize repository with a README” to ensure the repository is blank, then click the “Create project” button (e.g., [358]) to submit.

I am on the "Create blank project" form, which is the right template, with Project name and slug set to "web_agent". The Visibility Level shows "Private" is selected. The namespace selector shows "crew1", which should help avoid previous collisions. To ensure the repository is blank, I must uncheck "Initialize repository with a README" since it is currently checked (checkbox [347]). After unchecking, I can submit the form. Since only one action is allowed now, the best next step is to toggle off the README initialization by clicking the checkbox.

✅ Current Progress:

- “Project name” and “Project slug” are set to “web_agent”.
- Visibility Level is set to Private.
- Namespace currently selected: “crew1”.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to creating the repository.
- Blocking errors are present: “Project namespace name has already been taken”, “Name has already been taken”, and “Path has already been taken” (elements [240–245]), indicating a name/slug collision in the current namespace.
- Relevant interactive elements and states:
  - [274] textbox “Project name” — value='web_agent', required, enabled, visible.

  - [284] namespace selector button — label='crew1', hasPopup='menu', expanded=False, enabled, visible.
  - [320] radio “Private …” — checked=true, enabled, visible.
  - [347] checkbox “Initialize repository with a README” — checked=true, enabled, visible (this conflicts with the “blank repository” requirement).
  - [358] button “Create project” — enabled, visible.
- Submitting as-is will fail due to the collision and would not produce a blank repository because README is still enabled.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click checkbox [347] “Initialize repository with a README” to uncheck it (ensure the repository is blank).
- Click button [284] (namespace selector labeled “crew1”) to open the menu and select a different namespace where “web_agent” doesn’t already exist.

The goal is to create a private blank repository named "web_agent" using the blank project template. I’m on the “Create blank project” page with the project name and slug set to “web_agent,” and the visibility set to Private, which satisfies the privacy requirement. However, the form shows errors indicating a name/path collision in the current namespace (“crew1”), so I’ll need to switch to another namespace later.

To ensure the repository is truly blank, I must uncheck “Initialize repository with a README.” My last attempt to click the checkbox (bid 347) timed out because the label (bid 348) intercepted pointer events. The correct way to toggle it is to click the label itself. I’ll do that now to uncheck README; afterward, I can change the namespace to one without the collision and submit.
