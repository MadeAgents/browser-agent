The user wants to update the project's site title to "Title Wanted". On a static site, this usually means changing the HTML <title> element in index.html. We are on the project repository file list page for gimmiethat.space, and I can see an index.html listed. The right approach is to open index.html, then use the "Edit" function to modify the title tag, and commit the change to the main branch (as per tips, commit directly to main unless instructed otherwise). The first step is to click the index.html file to view its contents. I will click the 'index.html' link in the files table.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the repository “gimmiethat.space” and navigated to the index.html file view. The file content is visible, including the current <title> tag value.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to update the site title. You are viewing index.html (read-only viewer). Relevant interactive elements to proceed:
- Button/link “Edit” (file toolbar; visible/enabled) — needed to modify the file in-browser.
- Link “Open in Web IDE” (file toolbar; visible/enabled) — alternative edit path.
- Branch selector button “main” (id: [739]; visible/enabled) — indicates target branch for committing.
- Links “Find file” (id: [1151]), “Blame” (id: [1153]), and “History” (id: [1155]) — visible/enabled but not required for editing.
The code viewer shows the current HTML title tag, which needs to be changed to “Title Wanted,” but the content is not yet in edit mode.

The task is to update the site's HTML <title> to "Title Wanted" in index.html. We’re already on the GitLab single-file editor page ("Edit file") with the editor textbox focused (bid 1258). The current content shows "<title>Not an interesting site</title>" near the top of the file. To avoid overwriting the entire file using a fill action (which risks losing content below the visible portion), the safer approach is to precisely modify the title in place via the editor. The first step is to open the editor's find functionality to quickly locate the exact title text. I will use the editor shortcut to open the find dialog (Ctrl/Cmd+F) while the editor is focused, which positions the search to the correct field for subsequent replacement steps.

The goal is to change the HTML <title> to "Title Wanted" in index.html and commit. I’m on the single-file editor page with the find widget active, and the Find field already contains "Not an interesting site" with 1 of 1 match highlighted. To precisely modify only the title text, I should use the replace functionality. The UI shows a "Toggle Replace" button (currently collapsed). The next step is to expand the replace panel so I can input "Title Wanted" as the replacement and apply it to the highlighted match.
