The user needs to know all international airports within 5 km driving distance of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). The best approach on OpenStreetMap is:
1) Search for “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” to center the map on CMU.
2) Use the directions tool to check driving distances to nearby airports that are “international,” starting with Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT). If PIT is far beyond 5 km (which I know likely is), that likely implies there are no international airports within 5 km; but I should verify via the map.
First, I will search for CMU using the search textbox [162], which is currently focused, then I will click Go in the next step.
