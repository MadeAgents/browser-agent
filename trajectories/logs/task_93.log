 <think>
The user asks which US states border New Hampshire. This is a straightforward geography question; the bordering states are Maine to the east, Massachusetts to the south, and Vermont to the west. The task environment expects concise answers via the map site, but it's acceptable to provide the direct answer without navigating since it's general knowledge. I will send the concise list to the user using the send_msg_to_user action.
