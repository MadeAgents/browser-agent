✅ Current Progress: Opened the Reviews (2) section for the product and examined both visible reviews. Reviewers “Jay” and “Josef Bürger” do not mention price being unfair. No reviewers found who claim the price is unfair. ✅ Task completed.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the correct product detail view and directly shows customer reviews.
- Relevant elements:
  - Link “Reviews (2)” [1671] — active; reviews are visible.
  - Link “2 Reviews” [1534] — present and enabled; anchors to the review section.
  - Individual reviews (visible, non-interactive):
    - “Review by Jay” — content: “Nothing,....everyday use.” (no price complaint).
    - “Review by Josef Bürger” — content: “Die Haflinger sind wie beschrieben und erwartet sehr gut” (no price complaint).
  - “Add Your Review” [1537] and review form fields [1701, 1719, 1722, 1724, 1730] — enabled but not needed for the goal.

 <think>
The user wants a list of reviewers who mention that the price is unfair. The current page is the product detail page with the "Reviews (2)" tab already selected and visible. I reviewed the two customer reviews displayed:
- Review by Jay with the content “Nothing.....everyday use.” which does not mention price.
- Review by Josef Bürger with the content “Die Haflinger sind wie beschrieben und erwartet sehr gut” which also does not mention price.
Since neither review mentions anything about price being unfair, the correct response is to inform the user that none of the reviewers make such a claim and provide the brief review details as context. The best next step is to send this summary to the user using send_msg_to_user.
