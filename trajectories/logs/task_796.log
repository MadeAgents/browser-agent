✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “My Account” dashboard where addresses and recent orders are visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is on the critical path to changing the delivery address for the most recent order. Relevant interactive elements:
- “Recent Orders” section: Each order row contains a link with visible text “View Order” (links are visible and clickable). The top row corresponds to the most recent order.
- Address Book:
  - link “Manage Addresses” [1386] (visible, enabled).
  - link “Edit Address” under “Default Shipping Address” [1415] (visible, enabled).
These address links modify account-level addresses; changing the delivery address for an existing order typically requires using the order’s “View Order” link in the Recent Orders section. The Search control’s button [271] is disabled and not relevant.

The goal is to change the delivery address for the most recent order. I previously verified there’s no in-page option to edit the shipping address on the order details page, so the best alternative is to request the change via the Contact Us form. I’m currently on the Contact Us page where the required fields “Name*” and “Email*” are already filled, and I have populated the “What’s on your mind? *” textbox with a clear request referencing order #000000202 and the new address (155 5th Street, San Francisco, CA). The next logical step is to submit the form using the visible “Submit” button to send this request to support.

 <think>
The user wants to change the delivery address for their most recent order. I previously navigated to My Account → My Orders → the latest order (#000000202, status Pending). The order detail page did not present any “Edit” or “Change” controls for the shipping address. To accomplish the goal, I went to the “Contact Us” page and filled the message requesting the address change to “155 5th Street, San Francisco, CA” for order #000000202. 

On the current page, I see a success alert that reads: “Thanks for contacting us with your comments and questions. We'll respond to you very soon.” This indicates the request was successfully submitted. There’s no direct edit capability on the order page, so notifying support is the feasible path. Next, I should inform the user of the successful submission, the order’s status, and propose follow-up options.
