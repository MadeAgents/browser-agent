The user's goal is to measure the walking distance between Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the closest CVS using OpenStreetMap. The current page shows the search box already filled with "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" but the search hasn't been executed. To get a walking distance, I should use the directions tool (the two arrows icon), which provides A/B inputs and supports walking mode. The "Find directions between two points" control is visible as [167]. Opening the directions panel is the logical next step because it lets me enter CMU as the start and "CVS" as the destination, and then compute walking directions to (likely) the nearest matching CVS. Although there's a welcome overlay, clicking the directions link should open the directions panel; if it doesn't, I can close the overlay in a subsequent step. Given the single-action constraint, I will click the directions link now.

The user wants the walking distance, so I need to switch the routing mode from Car to Foot in the directions panel. The previous attempt to click the Foot radio [179] failed because the Car label [174] intercepted pointer events.

Goal: Measure walking distance between Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the closest CVS. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is open with mode set to Foot (walking). The "To" field currently contains CMU; the "From" field is empty.

Best strategy: Put CMU as the origin and search for “CVS” as the destination so the router likely picks the nearest CVS to CMU when calculating. To achieve this, first swap the fields using the "Reverse Directions" button so CMU moves to "From". Then, in the next steps, I will fill the "To" field with "CVS" and trigger routing.

Given the single-action constraint, the next optimal action is to click the "Reverse Directions" button [200] to place CMU in the "From" field.

 <think>
The user wants the walking distance between Carnegie Mellon University and the closest CVS using the current OpenStreetMap directions UI. The page already shows a walking route (Foot mode checked) from a CMU landmark (“Walking to the Sky, Forbes Avenue, … 15213”), which is on CMU’s campus, to “CVS Pharmacy, 4610, Centre Avenue, … 15213”. The directions summary shows Distance: 1.4km and Time: 0:19. Since the task asks for the distance and the required format for distances is without a space (e.g., “5km”), I will report “1.4km”.
