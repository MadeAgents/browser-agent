The user wants me to open their latest created issue that contains the word "better" in its title and check if it is closed. From the current Dashboard view, I see a top navigation bar with an "Issues" link (bid 153). To find the relevant issue, the logical first step is to navigate to the global Issues page where I can filter or search for issues by title. Once on the Issues page, I can use the search/filter tools to query "better" and then sort by creation date to identify the latest created issue. Therefore, the next best action is to click the "Issues" link to reach the issues listing.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the global Issues dashboard. No filtering for “better” or sorting by creation date has been applied yet, and no specific issue has been opened.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is relevant and on the critical path to the goal. It shows an issues list with controls to filter and sort.
- Search/filter input: textbox [327], empty and focusable (used to filter issues; needed to search for “better”).
- Status tabs: links [265] “Open 15”, [269] “Closed 53”, [273] “All 68” (visible; allow scoping results to open/closed/all).
- Sort control: button [519] “Updated date” (hasPopup=listbox; currently sorted by Updated date, not Created date). Link [566] “Sort direction” is present to change ascending/descending.
- Issue entries: list [568] with individual issue links such as [574] “404 for many URLs”, [599] “Let’s keep the project alive”, [624] “Tm Theme Editor”, etc. None of the currently listed titles in the provided tree include “better,” so filtering is likely required.
- The interface also shows auxiliary controls: button [290] “Recent searches” and an unlabeled button [513] (likely search/submit) next to the search field.

The user wants me to open the latest created issue that contains "better" in its title and then check if it is closed. On the current Issues dashboard (filtered by assignee=Byte Blaze), I can see two issues with "Better" in their titles:
- "Better initial load experience" (created May 18, 2017)
- "Better sharing solution" (created May 5, 2017)

Comparing creation dates, "Better initial load experience" (May 18, 2017) is the later one, making it the latest created among those visible with "better" in the title. To proceed, I should open this issue to inspect its status on the issue page. The link element for "Better initial load experience" has bid 828. Clicking it is the correct next step toward verifying if it is closed.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is an issue details view and is relevant to the goal, but additional verification is needed to ensure this is the latest created “better” issue.
- Status indicator: StaticText “Open” is visible in the header; button [668] “Close issue” is visible and enabled (confirming the issue is currently open).
- Navigation back to list (to verify “latest”): 
  - Breadcrumb link [612] “Issues” is visible and enabled.
  - Project navigation link [354] “Issues” with sublink [366] “Issues (List)” is visible and enabled.
- Search capability (for filtering by title): Top search textbox [168] “Search GitLab” is visible and empty; editable to search/filter issues.

The user asked to open their latest created issue with “better” in the title and check if it is closed. The current page is the issue details view for “Better initial load experience (#8)” within the Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts project. In the header area of the issue, I can see a status badge that reads “Open” and there is a “Close issue” button, which confirms the issue is currently not closed.

Earlier, from the issues list, I observed two “better”-titled issues with creation dates:
- “Better initial load experience” (May 18, 2017)
- “Better sharing solution” (May 5, 2017)

Thus, “Better initial load experience” is the latest created “better” issue. Since I’m already on that issue page and the status shows “Open,” I can report the result to the user without further navigation.
