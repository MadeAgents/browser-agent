- link 'Orders' [168] — visible and enabled; this is the primary entry to the orders grid needed to find Lily Potter’s pending order.
- link 'SALES' [156] — focused; confirms the Sales menu is open.
Other visible elements (e.g., 'Reload Data' [714], 'Go to Advanced Reporting' [723]) are not relevant to the goal.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the Sales > Orders page. The orders grid is visible and appears sorted by Purchase Date descending (columnheader shows “↓ Purchase Date”).

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to notify a customer via an order comment. However, the grid is currently filtered to “Alexander Thomas,” which is unrelated to the goal of finding Lily Potter’s most recent pending order.
- textbox “Search by keyword” [840] — visible, enabled, currently filled with “Alexander Thomas”.
- button “Search” [841] — visible and enabled.
- button “Clear all” [857] — visible; will remove the active keyword filter.
- button “Filters” [845] — available but not necessary for a keyword search.
- columnheader “↓ Purchase Date” — indicates descending sort, which is appropriate for finding the most recent order.
- “View” links in the Action column — available for each row to open an order (specific rows not yet relevant until the correct customer is filtered).

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button “Clear all” [857] to remove the current keyword filter.
- Type “Lily Potter” into textbox “Search by keyword” [840], then click button “Search” [841].

 <think>
The goal is to notify Lily Potter on their most recent pending order with a specific message. I’m currently on the order view page for Order #000000303, and the accessibility tree shows this order’s status is "Pending". The "Notes for this Order" section includes a Comment textbox [1051], a "Notify Customer by Email" checkbox [1055] (currently unchecked), and a "Submit Comment" button [1061]. To achieve the notification, I should first enter the provided message into the Comment field, then check the Notify Customer checkbox, and finally submit the comment. Since only a single action is allowed per step, the next best action is to fill the Comment textbox with the message "Thanks, your order is ready to be shipped!".

The user’s goal is to notify Lily Potter on her most recent pending order with the message provided.

On the order view page, the Comment textbox is filled with “Thanks, your order is ready to be shipped!”. To actually notify Lily, I must ensure the “Notify Customer by Email” checkbox is checked and then submit the comment. The checkbox [1055] is currently unchecked.
