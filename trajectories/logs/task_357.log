The user wants to check merge requests that require their review. From the current GitLab dashboard page, the most direct navigation path is the top navigation bar link labeled "Merge requests" (accessibility node [157]). Clicking this should take us to the merge requests overview where we can then filter to those requiring review. Since only one action is allowed at a time, the next best step is to click the "Merge requests" link to get to the relevant page before applying any filters.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the global “Merge requests” menu (top nav), revealing options relevant to review requests.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward the goal. The “Merge requests” top navigation item (id [157]) is expanded (expanded=True), showing:
- Link “Review requests for you 5” (id [168]): visible, enabled; this specifically targets merge requests requiring your review.
- Link “Assigned to you 3” (id [165]): visible, enabled; lists MRs assigned to you (not necessarily review requests).
Other elements (e.g., “Projects” list and search) are unrelated to the goal.

Goal: View merge requests that require the user's review. The top navigation "Merge requests" menu is currently expanded (expanded=True), showing two relevant links: "Assigned to you 3" and "Review requests for you 5". To directly access MRs requiring review, the best next step is to click "Review requests for you 5" (node [168]). This should take us to the pre-filtered list of review requests, aligning exactly with the user's goal.
