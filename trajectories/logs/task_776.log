The goal is to delete all reviews from the reviewer “Carlo.” I have already filtered the reviews by nickname “Carlo,” selected both results (the grid indicates “2 selected”), chosen the mass action “Delete,” and clicked “Submit.” This triggered a confirmation modal with the message “Are you sure?” The modal shows two buttons: “Cancel” and “OK,” with “OK” currently focused (element 1247). To finalize the deletion of the selected reviews, I need to confirm the action by clicking the “OK” button in this modal.

<action>
```click("1247")```
</action>
