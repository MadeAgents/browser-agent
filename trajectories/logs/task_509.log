The user wants to buy a product from the "Men's shoe" category that has at least 5 reviews, has the best rating, and is the least expensive among the best-rated options. I am currently on the homepage with a top navigation menu showing several categories, including "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry" (element [603]) which likely contains a submenu for "Men's shoe." Following the task tips, I should use the dropdown menus with hover to reveal nested categories rather than scrolling. The next step is to hover over "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry" to reveal its subcategories, then look for "Men's shoe" to click into that category.

  - Visible items with review counts on the grid (useful for the ≥5 reviews criterion):
    - “MARC JOSEPH NEW YORK Mens Lightweight … Athletic … Shoes” — shows star rating and “22 Reviews”; price $63.95; “Add to Cart” enabled (markers visible in screenshot).
    - “Cole Haan Men's Lionel Dress Chukka Boot” — shows star rating and “32 Reviews”; price $454.00; “Add to Cart” enabled (markers ~[7724] title, [7729] reviews visible in screenshot).
- No rating filter is present; scanning product tiles for star ratings and review counts is required. Sorting by Price can help surface cheaper options, then validate ratings/review counts on each tile or product detail.

The user wants to buy the best-rated Men's shoes product that has at least 5 reviews, and among those best-rated options, choose the least expensive. I'm already on the Men's Shoes category page with a product grid. On this page, I can see ratings and review counts directly on some product tiles. From the visible items:
- HAFLINGER slippers show 100% rating but only 2 reviews (fails the ≥5 constraint).
- MARC JOSEPH shows rating around 90% with 2 (possibly 22) reviews; the accessibility tree lists “2 Reviews,” which is <5 (so I cannot rely on it meeting the ≥5 constraint).
- Cole Haan Men's Lionel Dress Chukka Boot shows 92% with 10 Reviews and thus meets the ≥5 reviews criterion, and among the visible items it's the only one that clearly satisfies ≥5 reviews with a high rating.

Given the constraints and absence of rating filters, the practical path is to proceed with the Cole Haan product since it meets the ≥5 reviews criterion and has a strong rating (92%). To buy it, I should click the product link to open the product page where I can handle any size/color options before adding to cart. The "Add to Cart" on the tile may require options, so clicking the product title link is safer.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the Men’s Shoes category. Opened the “Sort By” dropdown and clicked the “Price” option to sort the listing by price. No product has been selected or added to cart yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is directly on the critical path (Men’s Shoes listing).
- Sorting controls:
  - Combobox “Sort By” [1452], expanded=True; current selection still shows “Position” [1453] selected=True; “Price” [1455] is visible but not marked selected yet.
  - Link “Set Descending Direction” [1456] is visible; indicates current sort direction toggle is available.
- Product grid:
  - List [1459] contains product tiles with prices, ratings, review counts, and “Add to Cart” buttons.
  - Example items visible:
    - “Reef Men's Twinpin Prints Sandals” link [1470], price $47.99; “Add to Cart” button [1482] visible/enabled.
    - “JOSEPH NEW YORK Mens Lightweight Fashion Slip On...” shows star rating with “17 Reviews”, price $63.95; “Add to Cart” visible.
    - “Cole Haan Men's Lionel Dress Chukka Boot” shows ~92% rating with “10 Reviews”, price $464.00; “Add to Cart” visible.
    - Some items (e.g., HAFLINGER slippers) show high ratings but only “2 Reviews” (do not meet ≥5 reviews).
- The listing provides enough information (ratings and review counts) to identify products meeting ≥5 reviews and compare ratings, then choose the least expensive among the highest-rated.

We need to sort by Price so we can efficiently find the least expensive item that still meets “best rating” with ≥5 reviews. My last attempt to click the “Price” option in the expanded Sort By dropdown timed out, likely because the option wasn’t visible when the click was attempted (the dropdown might have collapsed). To avoid the visibility issue, I’ll use keyboard navigation on the Sort By combobox. The “press” action focuses the element and sends the key to it. I’ll move one step down from “Position” to “Product Name” using ArrowDown; then in subsequent steps, I can ArrowDown again to reach “Price” and press Enter to select it. This approach avoids relying on the dropdown being visible.

The goal is to buy the best-rated Men's shoe with at least 5 reviews and, among those with the best rating, choose the least expensive. I'm on the Men's Shoes category page with many items. Sorting by price had interaction issues (the "Price" option click timed out). A more reliable approach is to use the left sidebar "Price" filter to narrow to affordable items ($0.00–$99.99), then scan for products showing ratings and review counts meeting ≥5 reviews and the highest rating (ideally 100%). Among those, I will select the least expensive. The "Price" filter link for $0.00–$99.99 is visible as element [1889].

- Observations vs. goal:
  - The page shows multiple low-priced items due to the active price filter.
  - Among currently visible tiles, only the MARC JOSEPH item clearly shows ≥5 reviews. To ensure the “best rating” criterion and then choose the least expensive among those, additional scanning or sorting by Price [1455] (ascending) will help surface cheaper candidates with ≥5 reviews.

The user’s goal is to buy the best-rated Men’s shoe with at least 5 reviews and, among those best-rated items, pick the least expensive. I’m on the Men’s Shoes category page with a price filter of $0.00–$99.99 already applied (shown under “Now Shopping by”). To efficiently locate the least expensive qualifying item, I should sort the listing by Price ascending. The “Sort By” combobox [1452] is visible and currently expanded with the selection still on “Position.” Attempts to click the “Price” option [1455] timed out (not visible), so using keyboard navigation is more reliable.

The user wants to buy the best-rated Men’s shoe with at least 5 reviews and ensure it’s the least expensive among those best-rated options. I’m on the Men’s Shoes category page with sorting by Price (ascending) as indicated by the URL and UI (product_list_order=price and “Set Descending Direction” link). The first page shows products from cheapest upwards.

From the visible items:
- PUMA Men's King FG Soccer Cleat: rating 80%, 12 reviews, $1.47
- Dr. Martens Men's Galia Fisherman Sandal: rating 85%, 12 reviews, $1.71

Other items on this page don’t show ratings/reviews in the accessibility tree. Among items with ≥5 reviews, the Dr. Martens has the higher rating (85% vs 80%) and thus is the “best rating” candidate on this cheapest page. Since we’re sorted by price ascending, it is also the least expensive among the best-rated (on this page) that meet ≥5 reviews.

To proceed safely with purchasing (in case there are options like size), I should click the Dr. Martens product title to open its product page before adding to cart. This avoids potential option selection errors that might occur with direct “Add to Cart” from the grid. The next best single action is to click the product link “Dr. Martens Men's Galia Fisherman Sandal” [1539].

- Navigated to Men > Shoes category and applied sorting by Price (ascending) and a price filter ($0.00–$99.99).
- Opened a candidate product page: “Dr. Martens Men's Galia Fisherman Sandal,” which has ≥5 reviews.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page relevance: On a product page within the correct category, but not optimal for the goal.
- This product’s details (from current page):
  - Rating: 85% with “12 Reviews” (link [1490]).
  - Price: $1.71 (visible text).
  - “Add to Cart” button [1559]: visible and enabled.
  - Options required: Color radios “Black” [1516], “Tan” [1520]; Size radios starting at “4” [1530] (more sizes likely present).
- Deviation: Previously on the category page, a cheaper item with a higher rating (100%) and ≥5 reviews was identified. This current product (85% rating, $1.71) is neither the best-rated nor the least expensive among qualifying items.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click breadcrumb link “Shoes” [1458] to return to the Men’s Shoes listing and select the item with 100% rating and ≥5 reviews at the lower price.

The task is to buy the best-rated Men's shoe with at least 5 reviews and, among those best-rated items, choose the least expensive. I’m currently on a specific product page (Dr. Martens Men's Galia Fisherman Sandal) which shows 85% rating with 12 reviews and $1.71 price. To verify it is indeed the best-rated option that also satisfies ≥5 reviews and is the least expensive among such top-rated items, I need to compare across the Men's Shoes category. The most efficient way is to return to the category listing page (already sorted by price ascending and with the $0–$99.99 price filter applied earlier) so I can evaluate multiple products’ ratings and review counts starting from the cheapest.

    - A black dress boot (“… Chelsea/Chukka Boot”) — shows ~92% rating with 10 reviews; price $3.41; product link (previously interacted id=1782) enabled; “Add to Cart” button enabled.
- Implication toward goal: To satisfy “best rating (highest) with at least 5 reviews,” candidates with 92%/10 reviews outrank those with 85%/12 and 80%/12. With sorting by Price ascending, the $3.41, ~92%/10-reviews boot appears to be the least expensive among the highest-rated (≥5 reviews) items visible on this page. Further pages are higher priced, so this item is a strong fit pending size/color selection on its product page.

Other items on this page show no ratings/reviews (thus likely not meeting the ≥5 reviews criterion). Among those with ≥5 reviews, the Dr. Martens item has the higher rating (85% vs 80%), and since we’re sorted by price ascending, it’s the least expensive among the highest-rated options visible that satisfy ≥5 reviews. To proceed with purchase (sizes/options may be required), I should open the product detail page via the product title before adding to cart. Therefore, the next best action is to click the Dr. Martens product link [1539].

The user wants to buy the best-rated item in the Men's Shoes category that has at least 5 reviews, and among those top-rated ones, choose the least expensive. I am on the Men's Shoes category page, already sorted by Price ascending (URL has product_list_order=price, and the "Set Descending Direction" link is visible). From the visible items, only two show ratings with review counts:
- PUMA Men's King FG Soccer Cleat: 80% with 12 Reviews at $1.47
- Dr. Martens Men's Galia Fisherman Sandal: 85% with 12 Reviews at $1.71

Other items on this page show no ratings/reviews (thus likely not meeting the ≥5 reviews criterion). Among those with ≥5 reviews, the Dr. Martens item has the higher rating (85% vs 80%), and since we’re sorted by price ascending, it’s the least expensive among the highest-rated options visible that satisfy ≥5 reviews.

✅ Current Progress:
- Reached a product detail page within Men > Shoes: “Dr. Martens Men's Galia Fisherman Sandal.”
- Verified it meets the ≥5 reviews condition (12 reviews) and noted its price ($1.71). No item added to cart yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- On-track status: Partially. You are in the correct category, but this item is not the best-rated option identified earlier (a 92%/10-reviews item existed on the listing). Current page shows:
  - Rating: “85% of 100” with link “12 Reviews” [1490].
  - Price: $1.71 (StaticText).
  - Required options (currently unselected):
    - Color radios: “Black” [1516], “Tan” [1520] (both unchecked).
    - Size radios: begin at “4” [1530] and others (all unchecked).
  - Qty spinbutton [1557]: 1 (editable).
  - “Add to Cart” button [1559]: visible; options must be selected first.
  - Breadcrumb to return to category: “Shoes” link [1458] (enabled, visible).
- Implication: Proceeding to purchase this item would not satisfy “best rating” among products with ≥5 reviews. Need to return to the Men’s Shoes listing (sorted by price) to choose the highest-rated qualifying product and then pick the least expensive among those.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click breadcrumb link “Shoes” [1458] to return to the Men’s Shoes listing page and select the highest-rated product (≥5 reviews), then proceed with the least expensive among those.

The user’s goal is to purchase the best-rated Men’s shoe with at least 5 reviews, selecting the least expensive among those best-rated options. We navigated to the Men’s Shoes category, sorted by price ascending, and observed two cheapest items with ≥5 reviews: 
- PUMA Men's King FG Soccer Cleat (80%, 12 reviews, $1.47)
- Dr. Martens Men's Galia Fisherman Sandal (85%, 12 reviews, $1.71)

Among items meeting ≥5 reviews on that cheapest page, the Dr. Martens has the higher rating (85% vs 80%), making it the best-rated candidate within the low-price range. We’re now on the Dr. Martens product page, which confirms 85% rating with 12 reviews and a $1.71 price. To proceed with purchasing, we must choose required options (Color and Size) before clicking Add to Cart. I’ll first select a color (Black) to satisfy the option requirement, then proceed to select a size and add to cart in subsequent steps.

The goal is to buy the best-rated product in the Men's Shoes category that has at least 5 reviews and, among those best-rated, select the least expensive. I’m currently on a specific product page (Dr. Martens Men's Galia Fisherman Sandal) which has 85% with 12 reviews at $1.71. Earlier, I observed at least one product (Cole Haan) with a higher rating (92% with 10 reviews), indicating that this Dr. Martens item is not the best-rated overall. To correctly identify the best-rated item across the Men's Shoes category and then choose the least expensive among those highest-rated with ≥5 reviews, I need to return to the Men's Shoes listing view. The breadcrumb contains a "Shoes" link that will take me back to the category page, where I can compare ratings and review counts across items (ideally still sorted by price ascending to find the least expensive among the best-rated).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is the Men’s Shoes category listing and is on the critical path to the goal.

    - “Cole Haan Men's Lionel Dress Chukka Boot” link [1773]; rating [1779] “92% of 100”; “10 Reviews” [1778]; price $464; “Add to Cart” [1780] enabled.
    - “HAFLINGER MEN'S Wool Felt Open Back Slippers...” link [1657/1658]; rating shows stars with “2 Reviews” [1659]; price $108.80; not meeting ≥5 reviews.
    - “MARC JOSEPH NEW YORK Men's Lightweight Fashion Slip On...” link [1734]; rating with “2 Reviews” [1759]; price $63.95; not meeting ≥5 reviews.

- To satisfy “best rating” with ≥5 reviews and choose the least expensive among those, sorting by Price ascending and/or applying the $0–$99.99 price filter is necessary before scanning for items with ≥5 reviews and the highest rating.
