The user's goal is to open an issue in the metaseq repository asking about plans for supporting Llama and related models. I navigated to the New Issue page and have already filled in the Title and Description fields with appropriate content that matches the user's request. The page shows the "Create issue" button (bid 857), and no required fields appear to be missing. To complete the task and officially open the issue, the next step is to click the "Create issue" button. This should submit the form and create the issue.

The user asked me to open an issue in the metaseq repository about plans for supporting Llama and related models. I navigated to the project, went to Issues, clicked New issue, filled in a clear title and a detailed description covering variants, capabilities, checkpoint compatibility, timelines, and how the community can help, then created the issue. The current page confirms success: it shows an open issue with the correct title, created just now by Byte Blaze, with reference byteblaze/metaseq#2 and URL ending in /issues/2. Since the goal is accomplished, the best next step is to inform the user with the direct link, status, and a brief summary, and offer to add labels/assignees if desired. I will use send_msg_to_user for this confirmation.
