 <think>
The user wants me to create a new GitLab repository named "nolan_honest_fans" and include the movies directed by Christopher Nolan in its README file. I'm currently on the GitLab dashboard, where I can start by creating a new project. On the page, there is a clearly labeled "New project" link/button (accessibility tree item [252]). The best next action is to click "New project" to open the project creation form. After that, I will choose creating a blank project, set the name to "nolan_honest_fans", enable "Initialize repository with a README", create the project, and then edit the README to add the list of Nolan's films. But for now, only one action is allowed, so I will click "New project".

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “Create new project” page on GitLab. No project has been created yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal. It presents three primary creation options:
- Link [241] “Create blank project” — visible and enabled. Appropriate for creating a repo named “nolan_honest_fans” and initializing a README.
- Link [248] “Create from template” — visible and enabled. Provides pre-populated files, which may be unnecessary for this goal.
- Link [255] “Import project” — visible and enabled. Not required for creating a new repo from scratch.
Also present: Link [263] “Show command” (optional CLI path).

No errors or detours detected; the relevant action is available on this page.
