The user wants the email address of the customer who is most unhappy with the style of Zoe products. This implies I need to look into reviews and identify the lowest “style” rating among reviews for Zoe products. According to the tips, reviews are under MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews. From the dashboard, the left navigation shows a MARKETING menu item. The best next step is to navigate to MARKETING, then likely to User Content > All Reviews, where I can filter for Zoe products and inspect style ratings and associated customer details. So first I will click MARKETING.

The user wants the email address of the customer who is the most unhappy with the style of Zoe products. We’re already on the Magento Admin Reviews grid (Marketing > User Content > Reviews).

The rows show multiple reviews for “Zoe Tank” with “Edit” links. A clearly negative-sounding title is “Huge arm holes??” (ID 345), which could correspond to low style satisfaction.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is related but not sufficient to fulfill the goal of finding the email of the customer most unhappy with the “style” of Zoe products.
- The current review’s Author is “Guest” (no customer email available).
- “Detailed Rating” is shown as star icons but no “Style” category label is visible here.

This page does not expose a customer email nor allow comparing “style” ratings across Zoe product reviews.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button id 699 “Back” to return to the Reviews grid, where you can filter for Zoe products and customer-authored reviews to locate the lowest “Style” rating.
- Alternatively, click button id 713 “Next” to navigate to the next review, looking for an Author that is a registered customer and checking the detailed ratings.

Objective: Find the email address of the customer (registered user) who is most unhappy with the style of Zoe products. We’re on the Reviews grid, which has filters.

After filtering, we’ll open review(s) to inspect the “style” rating to identify the lowest, then retrieve the reviewer’s email. 

Current page shows the filter row, and the "Type" filter is a combobox with options including "Customer" (element 845 for the combobox, option 848 for Customer). The best immediate step is to open the Type combobox so I can select "Customer". I will click the Type combobox (id 845) to expand it.

Objective: Find the email of the customer who is most unhappy with the style of Zoe products. We are on the Reviews grid. The optimal approach is to filter reviews to Zoe products, then (ideally) to Type = Customer, and then open individual reviews to check the “style” rating to identify the lowest. 

Earlier, I attempted to select “Customer” in the Type combobox (option 848) but it failed due to the element not being visible. To make progress without getting stuck on the combobox, I will first filter the Product field to “Zoe” so that the grid limits to reviews about Zoe products. Once filtered, I can either try setting Type to Customer again or open reviews to check if any are from registered customers and examine the style rating.

In the filter row, under the “Product” column, the textbox appears to be bid 851. Filling it with “Zoe” is the next best single action before clicking Search.

The task is to find the email address of the customer most unhappy with the style of Zoe products. I’m on the Reviews grid under Marketing > User Content, and I’ve already entered “Zoe” in the Product filter textbox (bid 851). To proceed, I need to apply the filter to narrow the list to Zoe product reviews. The “Search” button (bid 712) will apply the current filters. After filtering, I’ll look for Customer-type reviews (not Guests) and open the most negative “style” review to get the customer’s email.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Current page: Edit Review for product “Zoe Tank” (Review Details section).
- This page is not sufficient to achieve the goal because the review Author is “Guest” (no associated customer email).
- Relevant elements on this page:
  - Back button (id: 699) — visible/enabled; returns to the reviews grid.
  - Product link “Zoe Tank” (id: 733) — navigates to product, not needed for the email.
  - Status combobox (id: 773, value: Approved) and Save buttons (ids: 705, 709, 711) — not relevant to finding a customer email.
- To obtain an email, we must work with reviews of Type “Customer” on the reviews grid and identify the lowest “style” rating there. Being on a Guest review indicates we’re off-track.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button with id='699' (Back) to return to the reviews grid, where you can filter Type to “Customer” and proceed to identify the lowest “style” rating among Zoe product reviews.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The Reviews grid is on the critical path to find the lowest “style” rating for Zoe products and retrieve the reviewer’s email.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Product filter textbox under “Product” (id: 851): value set to “Zoe”, visible/enabled.
  - Type filter combobox under “Type” (id: 845): “Customer” option selected; filter needs to be applied.
  - Search button (id: 712): visible/enabled; required to apply the updated filters.
  - Reset Filter button (id: 715): visible/enabled.
  - Results table: currently shows “3 records found,” all Type = Guest (no email shown). Action column provides “Edit” links, e.g., “Edit” (id: 894 for the “Huge arm holes??” review; also 1095 on another row), to open review details where rating breakdown (including “Style”) and customer linkage can be viewed.

 <think>
The user wants the email address of the customer who is the most unhappy with the style of Zoe products. I navigated to Marketing > User Content > Reviews and filtered Product to "Zoe". The grid shows 3 reviews for "Zoe Tank", and the "Type" column for all of them is "Guest", which means there’s no associated customer account or email available. I attempted to further filter the "Type" to "Customer", but the UI option click failed and, regardless, the existing filtered results indicate there are no customer-type reviews for Zoe products. Since emails are only available for registered customers and none of the Zoe reviews are from customers, it’s not possible to provide the requested email. The correct response is to report infeasible with a clear reason.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Marketing > User Content > Reviews.
- Entered “Zoe” in the Product filter and clicked Search; 3 “Zoe Tank” reviews are listed.
- Opened/inspected a review (Guest author) and returned.
- Attempted to change the Type filter to “Customer,” but it has not been applied; the agent then prematurely reported the task infeasible.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This Reviews grid is on the critical path to find the lowest “style” rating for Zoe products and retrieve the reviewer’s email.
- Relevant interactive elements (visible/enabled):
  - Product filter textbox under “Product” (id: 851): filled with “Zoe”.
  - Type filter combobox under “Type” (id: 844): options include “Customer” (option id: 847); filter not yet applied (results still show Type = Guest).
  - Search button (id: 712): enabled; applies filters.
  - Reset Filter button (id: 715): enabled.
  - Results table shows “3 records found,” all with Type = Guest; Action column provides “Edit” links (e.g., id: 894) to view rating breakdown and any associated customer data.
- Deviation detected: The agent concluded infeasible without first applying the Type = Customer filter and verifying results.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Set the Type filter to Customer: click the combobox under “Type” (id: 844) and select option “Customer” (id: 847).
- Apply the filters: click the “Search” button (id: 712). If customer reviews appear, open the relevant review’s “Edit” link (e.g., in the Action column) to check the “Style” rating and retrieve the customer email.
