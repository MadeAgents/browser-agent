🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal. Relevant elements:
- Link “[624] ‘Tm Theme Editor’” — visible and enabled within the issues list.
- Filter tabs: “[265] ‘Open’”, “[269] ‘Closed’”, “[273] ‘All’” — visible and enabled.
- Issue search area:
  - Token “[318] ‘Assignee = Byte Blaze’” — active; removable via “[324] button” (visible).
  - Textbox “[327]” — empty, focusable (for typing a query like “theme editor”).
  - Search/submit “[513] button” — visible and enabled.
- Sort control “[519] button ‘Updated date’” — visible with popup.
Note: The last action targeted “[153] image” under “Merge requests,” which is unrelated to opening the desired issue.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link “[624] ‘Tm Theme Editor’” to open the issue details and check its status.
- If filtering is needed, first click “[324]” to remove the “Assignee = Byte Blaze” token, then type “theme editor” into textbox “[327]” and click button “[513]” to filter results before opening the latest matching issue.

Goal: Open my latest created issue with “theme editor” in the title and check if it’s closed.

Current page: Issues · Dashboard with a token filter "Assignee = Byte Blaze" applied. The list shows an issue titled "Tm Theme Editor" but it was created by "earle", not by me. Since the goal is specifically about issues I created, I should not rely on the current “Assignee” filter. Instead, I need to remove the "Assignee = Byte Blaze" token, then filter/search for "theme editor" and (ideally) apply an Author = Byte Blaze filter to find my authored issues and open the latest one.

First step toward that: remove the current "Assignee = Byte Blaze" token using its close button [324]. This will broaden results and prepare for adding the correct filter/search.
