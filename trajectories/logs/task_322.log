The user is asking about refund amount for an order cancelled in May 2023, excluding the shipping fee. To compute this, I need to access their order history, find the cancelled order(s) in May 2023, and view the order totals to subtract the shipping fee from the total refund (likely the grand total minus shipping, but the site may show line items like Subtotal, Shipping & Handling, Tax, Discounts). The site's tips mention: My Account > My Orders to find past purchases and that an order is considered out of delivery if marked "processing," but here it's cancelled, so we just need the cancelled order in May 2023.

On the current homepage, I see a "My Account" link in the banner (bid 227). The next step is to click My Account to go to account dashboard and then navigate to My Orders.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the “My Account” dashboard and located a canceled order from May 2023 in the “Recent Orders” table. The row shows Status “Canceled” and an Order Total of $363.42.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to determine the refund excluding shipping. The “Recent Orders” table (table labeled “Recent Orders” [1534]) lists a May 2023 order with Status “Canceled.” To compute the refund (grand total minus shipping), the shipping fee must be obtained from the order detail page.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link “View Order” for the canceled May 2023 row (visible text: “View Order”; marker near 1555 in the screenshot). State: visible, enabled.
  - Link “View All” [1530] (visible, enabled) to access the full orders list if needed.
  - Table “Recent Orders” [1534] (read-only, shows Order #, Date, Order Total, Status, Action).

  - Shipping & Handling: $15.00

The user wants the expected refund for their canceled order in May 2023, excluding the shipping fee. I’m currently on the detailed page for Order #000000170 with status “Canceled” and order date “May 17, 2023,” which matches the timeframe. The totals section shows:
- Subtotal: $350.42
- Shipping & Handling: $15.00
- Grand Total: $365.42

If the shipping fee is non-refundable, the expected refund equals Grand Total minus Shipping, which also equals the Subtotal in this case: $365.42 - $15.00 = $350.42. The site shows no taxes or other adjustments, so $350.42 is the correct refund amount. As per formatting guidance for amount questions, I will return just the decimal value.
