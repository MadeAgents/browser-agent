✅ Current Progress:
- Entered a label filter for “OpenAPI Generator CLI” and clicked the “Search” button on the project’s Issues page.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is the OpenAPI Tools / openapi-generator project’s Issues list, which is on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - textbox “Search or filter results...” [1312]: visible and enabled (current value not confirmed from axtree).
  - button “Search” [553]: visible and enabled (was clicked).
  - tabs: “Open 3,476” [503] selected; “Closed 2,951” [507] and “All 6,427” [511] available.
- The issues list [617] currently shows general issues (not clearly filtered to CLI-related labels), suggesting the label filter may not have been applied.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Type label:"OpenAPI Generator CLI" into the textbox “Search or filter results...” [1312], then click the “Search” button [553] to apply the filter.
- If results still appear unfiltered, broaden the filter: replace the textbox content [1312] with label:"CLI" and click “Search” [553].

- Entered the label filter “label:CLI” into the issues search/filter textbox.
- Previously tried filtering with “label:"OpenAPI Generator CLI"” and clicked “Search”.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is the repository’s Issues list, which is directly on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - textbox “Search or filter results...” [1312]: visible, enabled, focused, current value = “label:CLI”.
  - button “Search” [553]: visible and enabled.
  - tab “Open 3,476” [503]: currently selected; “Closed” [507] and “All” [511] also available.
- The filter text is present; applying the filter requires using the “Search” button [553] to update the results.

✅ Current Progress:

- Applied a label filter “Label = ~CLI”.
- Current result set shows 0 issues.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- On the critical path: this is the repository’s Issues list where label-based filtering is performed.
- The current filter “Label = ~CLI” is active and yields no results (“Open 0”, “Closed 0”, “All 0” tabs).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Button “Clear” [580]: visible, enabled — will remove the current filters.
  - Button “Search” [583]: visible, enabled — executes the current filter state.
  - Tabs: “Open 0” [504] (selected), “Closed 0” [508], “All 0” [512] — scope controls but all are empty due to the active label filter.
  - Project navigation link “Issues” [320]: visible, enabled — returns to the default Issues list view.
- The page is correct, but the active filter appears too restrictive or mismatched, producing no results.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button “Clear” [580] to remove the failing label filter.
- Click button “Search” [583] (or link “Issues” [320]) to reload the issues list without the filter, then reapply a valid label if available.

I’m currently on the repository’s Issues page with a filter token “Label = ~CLI”, but it yields no results (Open 0, Closed 0, All 0).

A reliable way to find valid label names is to open the project’s Labels page. From there, I can search for labels containing “cli” (e.g., “OpenAPI Generator CLI”) and then use the built-in link to view issues for that label. The Labels page usually provides an Issues link per label that will display the issues list filtered by that label automatically.

Therefore, the next best action is to navigate to the project’s Labels page at /-/labels so I can discover and select the correct CLI-related label(s).

- Navigated to the OpenAPI Tools / openapi-generator project’s Labels page to identify the correct CLI-related label(s) after issue filtering returned 0 results.
- Ready to search labels and open the Issues list for the appropriate label.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- On the critical path: Yes. The Labels page provides search and direct “Issues” links per label, which will open the issues list filtered by that label.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Searchbox “Filter” [498]: focused, empty, visible — used to find labels (e.g., type “CLI”).
  - Button “Submit search” [500]: visible, enabled — applies the label search.
  - Sort dropdown “Name” [503]: visible, enabled — optional for ordering labels.
  - Per-label actions (examples from current page):
    - For “.NET”: link “Issues” [556], link “Merge requests” [558], button “Subscribe” [561] — similar controls exist for each label row (e.g., “Announcement” Issues [573], “Bleeding Edge” Issues [590], etc.).
- No deviation detected. The next step is to search for labels containing “CLI” and use the corresponding “Issues” link to display issues tagged with that label.

✅ Current Progress:
- Reached the project’s Labels page for OpenAPI Tools / openapi-generator.
- Entered “cli” into the Labels Filter to locate CLI-related labels.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- On the critical path: Yes. Filtering labels and then using the per-label “Issues” link will display the repository’s issues filtered by the chosen CLI-related label.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Searchbox “Filter” [498]: value='cli', focused, visible — narrows the label list.
  - Button “Submit search” [500]: visible, enabled — applies the filter explicitly if needed.
  - Sort dropdown “Name” [503]: visible — optional for ordering labels.
  - Per-label actions (examples visible on this page):
    - “.NET” row: link “Issues” [556] (enabled).
    - “Announcement” row: link “Issues” [573] (enabled).
    - “Bleeding Edge” row: link “Issues” [590] (enabled).
  - Observation: The current filter “cli” returns many “Client: …” labels (because “cli” matches “Client”). The specific label related to OpenAPI Generator CLI is not yet visible in the current label list; continue refining/scrolling to locate a label such as “OpenAPI Generator CLI”, then use its “Issues” link to display the filtered issues.

Goal: Display issues in OpenAPITools/openapi-generator that have labels related to the OpenAPI Generator CLI.

Current page: Project Labels page with a filter searchbox currently set to "cli", which matches many "Client: ..." labels due to substring overlap. To find the intended label (likely "OpenAPI Generator CLI"), I should refine the filter text to the exact label name to narrow results. After narrowing, I can click the corresponding "Issues" link for that label to show filtered issues. The immediate next step is to update the Filter searchbox value from "cli" to "OpenAPI Generator CLI" to target the specific label.

Plan:
1) Replace filter text with "OpenAPI Generator CLI".
2) Submit search (next step).
3) Click the "Issues" link for the matching label to display the filtered issues list.

Proceed with step 1.

✅ Current Progress:

🔍 Current State Analysis:

- Observation: Despite the filter input showing “OpenAPI Generator CLI,” the label list still displays many unrelated labels, indicating the filter has not been applied yet. Once applied, locate the label related to OpenAPI Generator CLI and click its “Issues” link to view the filtered issues.
