The user wants me to open an issue in the "awesome-python" repository asking about plans for Python 3.11 related resources. I’m currently on the GitLab dashboard with a list of projects, but I don’t see "awesome-python" among the listed repositories. The general tips state that the global search bar is not working and that I should use a specific search URL format to find repositories. Therefore, the best next step is to navigate to the internal GitLab search results page for "awesome-python" using the provided URL pattern. Once I find the repository, I can go to its Issues section and create a new issue.

```fill('594', 'Hello,\n\nPython 3.11 is now widely available and brings notable performance improvements and new features (e.g., tomllib). Do you have plans to add Python 3.11–specific resources to awesome-python—for example, migration guides, libraries leveraging 3.11 features, and articles/tools related to 3.11 performance?\n\nIf this aligns with the project, I would be happy to help curate an initial list and submit a PR.\n\nThanks!')```</action>
