The task is to generate a sales orders report for last month relative to 3/15/2023, which is February 2023. We’re already on the Orders Report page with the Filter section visible. To produce the report, we need to set the date range to February 1–28, 2023 and then click “Show Report.” I will start by entering the From date as 02/01/2023 in the “From *” textbox (bid 769). After this, I will set the To date and adjust the Period to “Month” if needed, and finally click “Show Report.” Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best action is to fill the From field.
