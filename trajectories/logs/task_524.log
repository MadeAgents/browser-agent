The task is to star the top eight most starred repositories in GitLab. To find the global ranking of projects by stars, I should navigate to the Explore section rather than staying on the "Yours" tab of the dashboard, which lists personal projects. The page shows a navigation bar with "Yours", "Starred", "Explore", "Topics". Clicking "Explore" will likely present options like "Most Stars" where I can see the top projects across the instance and then star the first eight. Therefore, the next best action is to click the "Explore" link.

The task is to star the top eight most starred repositories. The current page is an issues list for a specific project (“OpenAPI Tools / openapi-generator”), which does not provide a way to star multiple repositories or view global rankings. To find and star the top repositories across the instance, I should navigate to the main Projects area that includes the “Explore” tab, and then switch to “Most stars” to see the global ranking. From this issues page, the most direct path is to click the “Dashboard” link in the top banner (bid 71), which takes me to the main dashboard with tabs like Yours / Starred / Explore. From there, I can proceed to Explore > Most stars and star the top eight. Therefore, the next best action is to click “Dashboard” [71].

✅ Current Progress: Reached “Projects · Explore · GitLab” with the project listing visible. The “All / Most stars / Trending” tabs are present. No repositories have been starred yet. Previous clicks on numeric counters led to non-starring pages.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal (it lists global projects and provides a “Most stars” tab to rank them).
Relevant interactive elements:
- Tab link “Most stars” [312] — visible, enabled (needed to sort projects by star count).
- Searchbox “Filter by name” [272] — visible, enabled, empty (not required for this task).
- Visibility filter button “Any” [318] — visible, enabled (can remain as-is).
- Project title links (to open a project where the actual Star toggle exists):
  - “Umano: News Read To You / AndroidSlidingUpPanel” [351] — visible, enabled.
  - “Meta / create-react-app” [389] — visible, enabled.
  - “Karl Kroening / ffmpeg-python” [427] — visible, enabled.
  - “Koushik Dutta / AndroidAsync” [465] — visible, enabled.
- Numeric metric links with icons (e.g., “1.5k” [414], “402” [452], “267” [376]) are visible and enabled but are counters/links, not the Star toggle; clicking them navigates away and does not star the repo.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the tab link “Most stars” [312] to sort projects by star count (ensures you target the true top eight).
- Then open a top project via its title link (e.g., click “Meta / create-react-app” [389]) and use the Star toggle on the project page to star it; repeat for the first eight entries.

The goal is to star the top eight most starred repositories. I’m on the Explore Projects page where I can see projects with their star counts. The display currently looks alphabetical (letters like A, C, F), indicating the “All” tab is active; attempts to click one “Most stars” link [294] timed out, and a previous try on a different “Most stars” link [312] didn’t change the ordering. Given that clicking the numeric star counters does not reliably toggle starring, the robust approach is to open each project’s page and use its Star toggle.

First, I’ll begin with the highest-starred project visible: “OpenAPI Tools / openapi-generator” (3.5k). I will click its project title link [655] to open the repository page, where I can find and click the Star button in subsequent steps. This avoids interacting with ambiguous counter links and ensures I can access the definitive star control on the project page.

✅ Current Progress:
- Starred “OpenAPI Tools / openapi-generator” (the project page shows a toggled star control as button labeled “Unstar” [585]). Progress: 1 of 8 top-starred repos starred.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is a single project (“OpenAPI Tools / openapi-generator”). While it allowed starring this repo, it does not list other globally top-starred projects, so it’s not optimal for continuing toward the goal.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Button “Unstar” [585] — visible, enabled; indicates this repo is already starred.
  - Link “Dashboard” [74] — visible, enabled; navigation back to the main hub where Explore is accessible.
  - Textbox “Search GitLab” [146] — visible, enabled, currently empty; can be used to locate other projects but won’t guarantee top-star ordering.
- Assessment: Partially on track (one repo starred), but to complete the goal efficiently, you need to navigate to the global projects list sorted by “Most stars.”

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link “Dashboard” [74] to return to the Projects hub, then proceed to the Explore > Most stars view to star the remaining top entries.

The goal is to star the top eight most starred repositories. I’m currently on the Keycloak project page, which shows an “Unstar” button, so this repo is already starred. To continue and star the remaining top repositories, I need to return to the global projects listing where I can access Explore > Most stars. The top navigation includes a “Dashboard” link [74], which leads to the Projects hub with the Explore tab. Given the last failed action was clicking another project link (579) and I should avoid repeating that, the best next action is to click “Dashboard” to navigate to the page where I can reach Explore and then the “Most stars” view to proceed with starring the remaining top entries.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page: “Projects · Dashboard · GitLab”. This view lists personal projects and is not the global ranking needed to find the top-starred repositories.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link “Explore” [268] — visible and enabled; navigates to the global projects listing.

The task is to star the top eight most starred repositories globally. From the Explore page listing, the top entries include “OpenAPI Tools / openapi-generator” and “Keycloak / keycloak,” which have already been starred as confirmed by earlier “Unstar” buttons. The next one to star is “Meta / create-react-app” (1.5k stars). Clicking the numeric star count link navigates to subpages (e.g., Issues), so the reliable approach is to open the project by clicking its title link and then use the Star button on the project page. I will click the project title link for “Meta / create-react-app” to proceed to its page and star it in the following step.

- Progress toward goal: 3 of 8 completed.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Current page: “Meta / create-react-app · GitLab” project page. This is on the critical path insofar as it’s one of the top-starred repos and is already starred.
- Relevant elements:
  - Button “Unstar” [590] — visible and enabled; indicates this repo is currently starred.
  - Link “53” [593] — visible; star count link; not needed for the goal.
  - Top banner “Dashboard” link [74] — visible and enabled; use to return to the Projects hub to access Explore > Most stars and continue starring remaining top repos.
  - Breadcrumb link “Meta” [504] — visible; navigational but not necessary for progressing the goal.

The goal is to star the top eight most starred repositories. I’m currently on the “Meta / create-react-app” project page, and the presence of the “Unstar” button indicates this repo is already starred, contributing to the progress (3 of 8). To identify and star the remaining top repositories, I need to return to the global projects listing via the Projects hub and then navigate to Explore > Most stars. The top banner shows a “Dashboard” link [74], which will take me to the hub with tabs like Yours, Starred, Explore, and Topics. From there, I can move to Explore and then “Most stars” to continue starring the next top repositories. Since the previous action timed out on a different element, I’ll proceed with clicking “Dashboard” now to continue the workflow.

The user’s goal is to star the top eight most starred repositories across the entire GitLab instance. I’m currently on the Projects dashboard page, which shows tabs including “Yours”, “Starred”, “Explore”, and “Topics”. To find the global list ranked by stars, I should navigate to the Explore section, as indicated by the site tips. From there, I can switch to the “Most stars” view and start starring the top eight. The “Explore” link is present and enabled with bid 268, so the next best step is to click it.

The goal is to star the top eight most starred repositories. I’m on the Explore page with a list of projects and their star counts. From the visible data, the top eight are: openapi-generator (3.5k), keycloak (1.6k), create-react-app (1.5k), node-http-proxy (482), ffmpeg-python (402), AndroidAsync (333), wxpy (295), and AndroidSlidingUpPanel (267). We have already starred three: openapi-generator, keycloak, and create-react-app. The next step is to star the remaining five, starting with “http ... PARTY! / node-http-proxy.” Clicking the numerical star link tends to navigate to subpages (e.g., Issues), so the reliable method is to click the project title to open its page and then use the Star button there. I will click the title link for node-http-proxy [729] to open its project page.
