The user wants to promote the GitLab repository byteblaze/dotfiles to the forum corresponding to subreddit "aww" and use the repository’s own description as the post body. On the Postmill homepage, I see a "Submit" link in the top navigation (bid 63). The optimal workflow is:
1) Open the submission form by clicking "Submit".
2) Then, in subsequent steps, gather the repo description from GitLab (likely via the GitLab site at 10.177.37.113:8023, searching for "dotfiles") and copy the exact description text.
3) Fill the submission fields: select the "aww" forum, include the repo URL and description in the Body while leaving the URL field empty as per the task tips, and submit.

First step is to click "Submit" to open the form.

The user wants to create a submission promoting the GitLab repository byteblaze/dotfiles to the forum “aww,” using the repository’s own description in the Body. The submission form is already open and visible with fields: Title (required), Body, Forum combobox, and a URL textbox (currently the “URL” radio is selected). Based on the Reddit task tips, when creating a post we should put all content including URLs in the Body field and leave the URL field empty. To include the repo description, I first need to fetch the exact description text from the GitLab repository. The GitLab tips indicate using the search URL endpoint rather than the site’s global search bar. Therefore, the most efficient next step is to open a new tab where I can navigate to GitLab, search for “dotfiles,” find the byteblaze/dotfiles repo, and read its description text. Opening a new tab prevents losing the current submission form state. After retrieving the description, I will return to this tab to fill Title, Body (including the repo URL and description), select “aww” in the Forum combobox, and submit.

The goal is to create a submission in the "aww" forum using the repository's own description for the Body. I already have the submission form open in Tab 0, and I opened a new tab (Tab 1) to fetch the repository description. The current active tab (Tab 1) is a blank about:blank page. To proceed efficiently, I should navigate to the GitLab instance to find the "byteblaze/dotfiles" repository and read its description. Based on the GitLab task tips, the global search bar is not working; instead, I should use the search URL endpoint. Therefore, the next step is to navigate to the GitLab search page using the provided format: http://10.177.37.113:8023/search?search=dotfiles&nav_source=navbar. From there, I can identify and open the specific "byteblaze/dotfiles" repo to retrieve its description text, then return to the submission form to fill Title and Body (including the repo URL) and select the "aww" forum before submitting.
