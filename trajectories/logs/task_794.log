✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “My Account” dashboard where recent orders and address information are visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is directly relevant to changing the delivery address for the most recent order. Key interactive elements:
- “Recent Orders” table with per-order actions:
  - Top-row “View Order” link (marker ID visible: [1601]), link is visible and enabled.
  - Additional “View Order” links for subsequent rows (e.g., [1607], [1613], [1619]), all visible and enabled.
- Address Book section (for default addresses—not order-specific):
  - “Manage Addresses” link [1483], visible and enabled.
  - “Edit Address” link (Default Shipping Address) [1512], visible and enabled.
- Search control: “Search” button [368] is disabled; not relevant to the goal.

The critical path is to open the most recent order via its “View Order” link and then locate an option to edit/change the shipping/delivery address for that specific order. The page appears on track for accomplishing the goal.

The goal is to change the delivery address for the most recent order. On the My Account page, I can see a “Recent Orders” table listing several orders. The top row shows order #000000200 dated 12/18/25 with status “Pending,” which is likely the most recent given the highest order number. To modify the delivery address, I need to open that order’s details page, where order-specific shipping address options (e.g., an Edit/Change Shipping Address link) should be available if editing is permitted for a pending order. The next step is to click “View Order” for order #000000200.

The user's goal is to change the delivery address for their most recent order. We previously checked the order details page and found no direct option to edit the shipping address, so we navigated to the Contact Us page to submit a request. The required fields (Name and Email) are already filled, and I have populated the "What’s on your mind?" field with a clear message specifying the order number (#000000200) and the new address (4000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA). The form appears ready, and the visible "Submit" button [1484] should send the request. The next logical step is to click "Submit" to complete the request.

The user wants to change the delivery address for their most recent order. I previously navigated through My Account → My Orders → the most recent order (#000000200, status “Pending”) and confirmed there was no in-order option to edit the shipping address. Given that constraint, the appropriate path is to contact support via the site’s Contact Us form.

On the current Contact Us page, the success alert “Thanks for contacting us with your comments and questions. We’ll respond to you very soon.” is visible, indicating the request was successfully submitted. I had filled the message field with a clear request referencing order #000000200 and the new address (4000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA). Since the change now depends on customer support action, the best next step is to inform the user that the request has been submitted and what to expect next.

No further clicks are necessary; I will send a confirmation message summarizing what was done and next steps.
