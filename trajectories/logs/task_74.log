The user wants the optimal route through three Pittsburgh locations starting at Carnegie Mellon University. I should use the OpenStreetMap search and directions tool. The current page shows the OSM homepage centered elsewhere (Singapore) with the search box focused (element [162]) and a "Go" button [165], and a "Find directions between two points" link [167]. First, I need to search for "Carnegie Mellon University" to bring the map and context to Pittsburgh. After that, I can use the directions feature to compute travel times between the pairs to compare two possible orders: CMU -> Apple Store Shadyside -> Starbucks on Craig Street versus CMU -> Starbucks on Craig Street -> Apple Store Shadyside. To begin, I will fill the search input with "Carnegie Mellon University" and then click Go in the next step.

The task is to determine the optimal route visiting three locations in Pittsburgh: Carnegie Mellon University (start), Apple Store Shadyside, and Starbucks on Craig Street, minimizing total travel time. On OpenStreetMap, the best approach is:
1) Search for "Carnegie Mellon University" to move the map to Pittsburgh and confirm context.
2) Use the directions tool ("Find directions between two points" with the two arrows) to compute durations for both permutations of the remaining two stops:
   - Route A: CMU -> Apple Store Shadyside -> Starbucks on Craig Street
   - Route B: CMU -> Starbucks on Craig Street -> Apple Store Shadyside
3) Compare total travel times.

Currently, the search box is already filled with “Carnegie Mellon University” (element [162]) and the Go button [165] is available. The map is showing Singapore, indicating the search hasn’t been executed yet. The next logical step is to click the Go button to run the search and bring up results for CMU in Pittsburgh, which will set the context for directions. After that, I can proceed to the directions tool.

Therefore, I will click the Go button.

The “To” field is currently populated with “Carnegie Mellon University, … 15213, United States” and the “From” field is empty.

The simplest way is to use the “Reverse Directions” button so CMU moves to the “From” field and the “To” field becomes empty. Then, I can calculate travel times for the two possible visit orders by entering the next destination in “To,” capturing the travel time, then chaining the second leg, or by computing each leg separately and summing.

Since the OSM UI here appears to support only two points at a time (no visible “add via” button in the accessibility tree), I’ll compute the times for each leg separately and then sum them. The next step is to compute CMU → Apple Store Shadyside by entering “apple store shadyside” in the “To” field. After entering it, the route should calculate (if not, pressing Enter can be done next). I will then capture the time shown. So, I’ll first fill the “To” textbox with “apple store shadyside.”

The objective is to find the optimal order to visit all three locations starting at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and minimizing total travel time. We're on the OpenStreetMap directions panel with “Car” mode and OSRM selected. The “From” field is already set to a CMU location (“Walking to the Sky, Forbes Avenue… 15213”), and the “To” field contains “apple store shadyside”. To proceed, I should trigger the route calculation to obtain the travel time for the first leg (CMU → Apple Store Shadyside). In this environment, routes do not always compute automatically upon typing, and the Task Tips mention needing to “press” after inputting. The best next step is to press Enter on the focused “To” textbox (bid 199) to compute the route and get the time, which will allow me to later compare with the alternative sequence (via Starbucks on Craig Street).

The goal is to determine the optimal order to visit three locations starting at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and minimizing total travel time. The current OSM directions panel shows a computed route from CMU (“Walking to the Sky…” on Forbes Avenue) to Apple Store Shadyside with distance 1.5km and time 0:02. To compare total travel times for both possible sequences, I need the times for:
- A: CMU → Apple Store → Starbucks on Craig Street
- B: CMU → Starbucks on Craig Street → Apple Store

I already have the first leg of sequence A (CMU → Apple Store). Next, I need Apple Store → Starbucks Craig. The fastest way is to reverse the route so the start becomes the Apple Store, then change the destination to “starbucks on craig street” and compute. Since only one action is allowed per step, I’ll start by clicking “Reverse Directions” (bid 200) to set Apple Store as the “From” point.

Task: Find the optimal visiting order for three Pittsburgh locations—starting at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), then visiting Apple Store Shadyside and Starbucks on Craig Street—minimizing total travel time by car.

Right now, “From” is Apple Store Shadyside and “To” is CMU (Walking to the Sky), showing 1.5km and 0:03. Earlier, the CMU → Apple Store leg showed 1.5km and 0:02, which we will use for sequence A. Next, to compute the Apple Store → Starbucks on Craig Street leg, I need to change the “To” field to “starbucks on craig street” and then press Enter in the following step to get the time.

The task is to find the optimal visiting order for three locations starting at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to minimize total travel time by car. There are only two possible sequences to compare since the start is fixed:
- Sequence A: CMU → Apple Store Shadyside → Starbucks on Craig Street
- Sequence B: CMU → Starbucks on Craig Street → Apple Store Shadyside

We are using OpenStreetMap’s directions panel (Car mode, OSRM). I already captured CMU → Apple Store as 0:02 earlier. I reversed the route so “From” is now Apple Store and set “To” to “starbucks on craig street,” but the displayed results (1.5km, 0:03) are still for Apple Store → CMU. I need to submit the new destination to compute the Apple Store → Starbucks leg to complete Sequence A’s total time. The “To” textbox (bid 199) is focused with the text “starbucks on craig street,” so pressing Enter will trigger the route calculation. After obtaining this time, I will later compute CMU → Starbucks and Starbucks → Apple for Sequence B and compare totals. For now, the next best single action is to press Enter on the “To” field to recalculate the route.

The task is to find the optimal visiting order starting at Carnegie Mellon University and including Apple Store Shadyside and Starbucks on Craig Street by minimizing total travel time. We are using the OpenStreetMap directions panel with Car mode (OSRM). Currently, “From” is set to Apple Store, and “To” shows “starbucks on craig street,” but the displayed directions are still Apple Store → CMU (1.5km, 0:03), indicating the Starbucks query didn’t resolve previously and the route is stale. The earlier attempt to submit “starbucks on craig street” failed with a search error, so the best next step is to refine the destination query to something the OSM geocoder can recognize, such as “Starbucks, Craig Street, Pittsburgh,” and then in the following step press Enter to compute Apple Store → Starbucks. This will give us the second leg of sequence A, after which we can compute the legs for the alternative sequence B.

The goal is to find the optimal order to visit three Pittsburgh locations, starting from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU): Apple Store Shadyside and Starbucks on Craig Street, minimizing total travel time by car. To compare the two possible sequences (CMU → Apple → Starbucks vs. CMU → Starbucks → Apple), I’m using OpenStreetMap’s routing panel with OSRM in Car mode.

Current page state:
- “From” field [194] is Apple Store, Walnut Street, Shadyside, which became the start after I previously reversed the route.
- “To” field [199] is “Starbucks, Craig Street, Pittsburgh,” and it is focused.
- The directions table still shows a stale route (Apple Store → CMU) with 1.5km and 0:03, meaning the new destination hasn’t been submitted yet.

Plan:
- Submit the “To” field to recalculate the route to Starbucks on Craig Street from Apple Store by pressing Enter on the focused “To” textbox.
- This will give me the Apple Store → Starbucks time, completing the second leg for sequence A (CMU → Apple → Starbucks). Afterward, I will compute the alternative sequence times and compare.

Since only one action is allowed per step, I will press Enter on the “To” field now.

The user needs the optimal order to visit three locations starting at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU): Apple Store Shadyside and Starbucks on Craig Street, minimizing total travel time. To decide, I must compare the total travel time of the two possible sequences:
- Sequence A: CMU → Apple Store → Starbucks
- Sequence B: CMU → Starbucks → Apple Store

On the current OpenStreetMap directions panel (Car mode, OSRM), I’ve already computed:
- Apple Store → Starbucks = 1.9km, 0:03
- Previously noted CMU → Apple Store = 0:02
This gives Sequence A’s partial total of 0:05 (CMU → Apple 0:02 + Apple → Starbucks 0:03).

To evaluate Sequence B, I need:
- CMU → Starbucks
- Starbucks → Apple Store

Right now, the routing fields show From: Apple Store and To: Starbucks. The fastest next step is to click “Reverse Directions” so that From becomes Starbucks and To becomes Apple Store, giving me the Starbucks → Apple leg time immediately. After that, I can set From to CMU and To to Starbucks to compute the other leg, then compare totals.

Since only one action is allowed, I will reverse the directions now.

- Previously computed: Apple Store ↔ Starbucks (Craig St) = 0:03 in each direction.
- Partial totals:
  - Sequence A (CMU → Apple → Starbucks) = 0:02 + 0:03 = 0:05.
- Remaining to decide optimal order: obtain CMU → Starbucks travel time to compare against Sequence B (CMU → Starbucks → Apple = [CMU→Starbucks] + 0:03).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path for determining the optimal route.
- Relevant elements (visible and enabled):
  - Mode radio “Car” [173]: checked.
  - “Directions services” combobox [182]: OSRM selected.
  - “From” textbox [194]: value = “Carnegie Mellon University, Hamerschlag Drive, … Pittsburgh, 15213, United States”.
  - “To” textbox [199]: value = “Starbucks, Craig Street, Pittsburgh”, focused.
  - “Reverse Directions” button [200]: available.
  - Results table [526]: shows Distance [531] = 1.5 km; Time [532] = 0:02 with turn list ending on Walnut Street, indicating the route is still CMU → Apple Store (the new “To” entry for Starbucks has not been submitted yet).
- No error state detected; one more leg (CMU → Starbucks) needs to be calculated to finalize the optimal sequence.

The user wants the optimal visiting order through three locations starting at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to minimize total travel time. On the OpenStreetMap directions panel, Car mode with OSRM is selected. The “From” field currently contains “Carnegie Mellon University, … 15213” and the “To” field is focused with “Starbucks, Craig Street, Pittsburgh.” However, the directions table still shows the previous route (CMU → Apple Store) with 1.5km and 0:02, indicating the new destination hasn’t been submitted yet. To compare the two possible sequences (CMU → Apple → Starbucks vs. CMU → Starbucks → Apple), I need the CMU → Starbucks leg time. The best next step is to submit the “To” field by pressing Enter so the route recalculates to Starbucks on Craig Street from CMU.

The user asks for the optimal order to visit three Pittsburgh locations starting at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to minimize total travel time. I’ve been using the OpenStreetMap directions panel (Car mode, OSRM) to compute the legs needed to compare the two possible sequences, since the start is fixed:

- Sequence A: CMU → Apple Store Shadyside → Starbucks on Craig Street
- Sequence B: CMU → Starbucks on Craig Street → Apple Store Shadyside

From the current page state and prior computed legs on this OSM panel:
- CMU → Starbucks on Craig Street shows Distance 532m and Time 0:01.
- CMU → Apple Store Shadyside showed Time 0:02.
- Apple Store Shadyside ↔ Starbucks on Craig Street showed Time 0:03.

Thus:
- Sequence A total: 0:02 + 0:03 = 0:05
- Sequence B total: 0:01 + 0:03 = 0:04

Therefore the optimal route is CMU → Starbucks on Craig Street → Apple Store Shadyside, total 0:04. The best next action is to deliver the concise final answer to the user, including the leg times and total.
