The user’s goal is to like (upvote) all submissions created by the user "CameronKelsey" in the forum "earthporn". To accomplish this, I need to locate the user's submissions and then upvote each that belongs to the earthporn forum. A practical approach is:
- Find the user profile for "CameronKelsey" to view all their submissions (the Task Tips explicitly say to visit the user profile to see the list).
- From their submissions list, identify those in the earthporn forum and upvote each.
To start, I should find the user profile. The current page has a search box labeled "Search query" (bid 55). Using the search is the fastest way to locate a user profile. The first step is to enter "CameronKelsey" into the search box. After this, I can execute a follow-up action to submit the search (e.g., press Enter). For now, I will fill the search box with "CameronKelsey".

✅ Current Progress: Entered the search term “CameronKelsey” into the site’s search box.

🔍 Current State Analysis: You are on the Postmill home feed, which is acceptable for initiating the search needed to reach the user’s submissions. The key interactive element relevant to proceed is:
- searchbox labeled “Search query” (node [55]): value='CameronKelsey', focused, visible, enabled. No separate search button is visible in the axtree.
Other visible controls (e.g., “Filter on: Subscribed” [123], “Sort by: Hot” [138], feed links) are not directly relevant to locating CameronKelsey’s submissions.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- The last action repeated filling a field that already contained “CameronKelsey.” To progress, submit the search: press Enter while focus is in the input field “Search query” (node [55]).

✅ Current Progress: Submitted a search for “CameronKelsey” and arrived at the Search results page showing items that reference posts by CameronKelsey.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current “Search” page is on the critical path to finding and liking CameronKelsey’s submissions in the earthporn subreddit/community. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link to post titled “I can't wait for all this green to start coming back! | Little White Salmon River, WA, USA | [OC] [5075x6767]” (node [138]): visible, enabled. Labeled “by” author link [140] “CameronKelsey” (enabled).
- Link to post titled “2 years later, this is still one of the most incredible evenings of my life | Yosemite National Park, CA, USA | [OC] [3710x5565]” (node [191]): visible, enabled. Labeled “by” author link [193] “CameronKelsey” (enabled).
- The page heading indicates “3 results for CameronKelsey,” so there is at least one additional result below (not fully listed in the provided tree).
- Each result item includes “Upvote” and “Downvote” controls within the result (e.g., buttons [155] and [166]); to like the original submission(s), navigate through the post title links (e.g., [138], [191]) to each post’s page and use the upvote control there.
- Search controls remain available: searchbox “Search query” (node [112], value='CameronKelsey', focusable) and “Search” button (node [115], enabled).

The goal is to like (upvote) all submissions by CameronKelsey in the earthporn forum.

In the search results, the author name “CameronKelsey” appears as a clickable link within each item (e.g., node [140]).
