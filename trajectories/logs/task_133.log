The user asks: "How many commits did Eric make to a11yproject on 3/2?" I interpret "a11yproject" to refer to "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" repository visible on the Projects dashboard. To find the count of commits by Eric on March 2, I should:
- Click into the "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" project.
- Navigate to the repository's "Commits" tab.
- Look for commits on March 2 (likely the year shown in the repo history, possibly 2023 given the context).
- Count entries authored by someone named "Eric" on that date.

The current page shows the Projects dashboard, with the desired repository listed and clickable via element [394]. The next best action is to click that repository link to access it.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com project page on GitLab (repository overview visible).

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal of counting Eric’s commits on 3/2. The commit history is directly accessible.
- Link “2,320 Commits” [687]: visible and enabled — should open the repository’s commit history where dates/authors can be reviewed.
- Sidebar link “Repository” [297]: visible and enabled — alternative path to repository views, including commits.
- Breadcrumbs [580] with project links [588], [591]: visible — for navigation but not essential for the task.

The user asks for the number of commits Eric made to the a11yproject on 3/2. I’m currently on the project’s overview page for The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com. To find commit counts by date/author, the best path is to open the repository’s commits list. On this page, there’s a prominent link labeled “2,320 Commits” (bid 687) which should navigate to the full commit history. Once on the commits page, I can look for entries on March 2 (likely grouped by date) and count those by Eric. The immediate next step is to click the “2,320 Commits” link to access the commit history.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the repository’s Commits page for The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com (branch: main). The commit list with date-grouped counts is visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to determine how many commits Eric made on 3/2.
- Button “Author” [800]: visible, enabled, hasPopup menu, expanded=False — relevant for filtering commits by author (to isolate Eric’s commits).
- Searchbox “Search by message” [842]: visible, empty — optional; not needed for author/date filtering.
- Branch selector “main” [588]: visible, enabled, expanded=False — confirms we are viewing the main branch.
- Commits list [847]: visible — shows date-grouped entries with commit counts (e.g., listitem [848] displays “14 Mar, 2023 — 2 commits”). Scrolling should reveal “02 Mar, 2023” with its commit count once filtered to Eric (or unfiltered if counting all authors).

The user's goal is to find how many commits Eric made on 3/2 in the a11yproject repository. I’m already on the Commits page for The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com (branch main). The commits are grouped by date. In the list, I can see the section labeled "02 Mar, 2023 — 3 commits". Within that section, there are three commit entries: two authored by "Eric Bailey" and one authored by "Philip Wong". Therefore, Eric made 2 commits on that date. No further navigation or filtering is needed; I can directly report the count with brief context.
