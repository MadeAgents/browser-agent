The user wants to compare the payment difference of the last 4 cancelled orders and completed orders. To do this in Magento Admin, I should navigate to Sales > Orders, filter by order status (Cancelled and Complete), sort the results by Purchase Date in descending order (as required by the task tips), take the latest 4 from each status, collect their totals (Grand Total or similar), then compute the sums and the difference using the calculate() function. 

Currently on the Dashboard page, the top navigation shows "SALES". The next logical step is to click the SALES menu to access the orders listing. From there I can proceed with filtering and sorting. So I will click the "SALES" link in the top menubar.

The goal is to compare the payment difference between the last 4 cancelled orders and the last 4 completed orders. To achieve this, I need to navigate to the Orders list where I can filter by order status and sort by Purchase Date descending, as required by the benchmark tips. From the Dashboard, the SALES menu is already expanded, revealing a vertical submenu with an "Orders" link [168]. The appropriate next step is to click "Orders" to access the Orders grid. Once on that page, I will sort by Purchase Date (descending), filter for "Canceled/Cancelled" to collect totals of the latest 4 orders, repeat for "Complete", then use calculate() to compute the difference.

The task is to compare the payment difference between the last 4 cancelled orders and the last 4 completed orders. To comply with the benchmark rule, I must explicitly sort the Orders grid by Purchase Date in descending order at least once. The Orders grid is visible, and the Purchase Date column header shows "↑ Purchase Date", which may indicate ascending; regardless, I should click it to enforce the descending sort. After sorting, I will open Filters, select Status = Canceled, record the "Grand Total (Purchased)" of the first 4 rows (most recent), then switch Status to Complete, record the first 4 totals, and use calculate() to compute the sums and the difference.

Goal: Compare the payment difference between the last 4 cancelled orders and the last 4 completed orders.

Current page: Sales > Orders grid is visible. The Purchase Date column shows a down arrow (↓ Purchase Date), implying descending, but the visible top rows display early 2022 dates (Jan), which suggests either the sort state vs. page is inconsistent or we are on page 1 of 2 with ascending sorting. Regardless, benchmark rule 11 requires sorting by Purchase Date descending at least once, which I have already done by clicking the column header. For accuracy, I will filter by Status and then ensure the filtered results are sorted by Purchase Date descending before picking the last 4 orders for each status.

Plan:
1) Open Filters.
2) Filter Status = Canceled.
3) Ensure Purchase Date descending for filtered results, capture first 4 Grand Total (Purchased) values.
4) Repeat for Status = Complete.
5) Use calculate() to compute sums and the difference, then report.

Next best step: Click the Filters button to open filtering options so I can select Status = Canceled.

  - [899]/[886] “Grand Total (Purchased)” and “Grand Total (Base)” filter ranges — all empty; optional.
  - [955] “Purchase Point” store view combobox — value “All Store Views”; fine to leave as is.
- Grid columns to use when collecting values:
  - “Status” column (e.g., [1402]) — to verify filtered results are Canceled/Complete.
  - “Grand Total (Purchased)” column (e.g., [1400]) — the values to sum for the latest 4 orders in each status.

Objective: Compare the payment difference between the last 4 canceled orders and the last 4 completed orders. We are on Sales > Orders and have already filtered Status = Canceled. Benchmark rule 11 requires sorting by Purchase Date descending at least once; I clicked the Purchase Date header earlier, which now shows "↓ Purchase Date". However, the first rows in the grid are from early January 2022, and later dates (2023) appear further down, indicating the current sort is likely ascending (oldest first). To correctly retrieve the most recent 4 canceled orders at the top of the list without scrolling (scrolling is discouraged), I should toggle the Purchase Date sort again to ensure true descending (newest first). Once descending is confirmed, I will read the top 4 Grand Total (Purchased) values, then switch the Status filter to Complete, ensure descending, read the top 4, and compute sums and their difference using calculate(). Next step: click the Purchase Date column header to toggle the sort order to descending so the latest canceled orders appear first.

✅ Current Progress:

- Applied Status filter = “Canceled” (Active filters show “Status: Canceled”).
- Per page set to 200; 147 records found on a single page.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This Orders grid is on the critical path to the goal (we need the latest 4 canceled and completed orders’ totals).
- Key elements available and relevant:
  - Active filters list [862] shows “Status: Canceled”; remove filter button [9764] and “Clear all” [864] are present.
  - Filters toggle [857] to switch status later to “Complete.”
  - Column header “Purchase Date” [1392] currently shows “↑ Purchase Date” (ascending), meaning oldest orders are at the top.
  - Column header “Grand Total (Purchased)” [1400] identifies the totals to read.
  - Grid/table [1370] with rows under [1410]; “per page” [1106] = 200 ensures the top rows are visible.
- Issue: Sorting is ascending (“↑”), which would not show the latest 4 canceled orders at the top. Descending order is required to capture the most recent 4.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click column header [1392] “Purchase Date” to toggle to descending (look for “↓ Purchase Date”) so the newest canceled orders appear first.
- Then read the first 4 cells under the “Grand Total (Purchased)” column [1400] to capture totals for the latest 4 canceled orders.

The user wants the payment difference between the last 4 canceled orders and the last 4 completed orders. I’m already on Sales > Orders, and the active filter shows Status: Canceled. The grid appears sorted by newest first because the top rows show dates from May 2023 and then go back in time (April 2023, etc.). That satisfies the requirement to retrieve the most recent orders. I will take the top 4 “Grand Total (Purchased)” values for canceled orders:

1) 000000299 — $219.40
2) 000000136 — $208.20
3) 000000242 — $183.00
4) 000000025 — $204.25

I should store these amounts so I can switch the filter to Completed next without losing them. I’ll use take_note to save the canceled totals and then proceed to switch status to Complete in the following step.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Sales > Orders (Magento Admin).
- Applied Status = “Canceled” and captured latest 4 canceled “Grand Total (Purchased)” values: 219.40, 208.20, 183.00, 204.25.
- Switched filter to Status = “Complete” and extracted latest 4 completed “Grand Total (Purchased)” values: 93.40, 89.00, 159.40, 88.40.
- Computed the sum for the 4 completed orders: 430.20.
- Pending: compute the sum for the 4 canceled orders and then compute the difference between the two sums.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page is on the critical path (Sales > Orders grid where totals can be read).
- Active filters area [858]/[862] shows Status: Complete with a remove button [10660]—filter is applied.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Filters button [857] (visible, enabled) for adjusting Status.
  - “Purchase Date” column header [1392] shows “↑ Purchase Date” (currently ascending); can be clicked to toggle order.
  - “Grand Total (Purchased)” column header [1400] present (used for extracting totals).
  - “per page” input [1106] set to 200; pagination controls [1135]/[1136]/[1138] indicate a single page (disabled), so the dataset is fully visible.
- No errors or off-track indicators detected; the current page and filters align with the task.

We’re on Sales > Orders with the grid filtered to Status: Complete currently, and earlier we filtered to Canceled and captured the latest 4 canceled order totals. We have already:
- Ensured sorting by Purchase Date (clicked the column header as required).
- Collected the latest 4 canceled Grand Total (Purchased): 219.40, 208.20, 183.00, 204.25 (saved via take_note).
- Collected the latest 4 completed Grand Total (Purchased): 93.40, 89.00, 159.40, 88.40.
- Computed the sum for the completed orders: 430.20 (via calculate).

Next, I need to compute the sum for the canceled orders using calculate, then I’ll compute the difference between the two sums and report back. Since only one action is allowed per step, the immediate next action is to calculate the canceled total sum.

The user’s goal is to compare the payment difference between the last 4 cancelled orders and the last 4 completed orders. I navigated to Sales > Orders and enforced a sort by Purchase Date (clicked the column header) to satisfy the requirement to sort by Purchase Date descending at least once. I then:
- Filtered Status = Canceled and captured the top 4 “Grand Total (Purchased)” values (most recent): 219.40, 208.20, 183.00, 204.25 (saved via take_note).
- Switched the filter to Status = Complete and captured the top 4 “Grand Total (Purchased)” values (most recent): 93.40, 89.00, 159.40, 88.40.

- Completed total: 93.40 + 89.00 + 159.40 + 88.40 = 430.20
- Cancelled total: 219.40 + 208.20 + 183.00 + 204.25 = 814.85
