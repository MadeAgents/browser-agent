The user's goal is to submit a merge request to merge the "build time debug" branch into the "main" branch and assign themselves (byteblaze) as the reviewer. We're currently on the project page for "Primer / design" and see the left sidebar with navigation, including a "Merge requests" link. The logical next step is to go to the Merge requests section where there should be a "New merge request" button to start the MR creation flow. From there, I can choose the source branch "build time debug" and target "main", then set the reviewer to myself. So, first I will click the project-level "Merge requests" link to get to the MR list and creation UI.

The task is to submit a merge request from the source branch debug-build-time into main and assign myself (byteblaze) as the reviewer. On the current "New merge request" page, the branches are correctly set (From: debug-build-time [567], Into: main [568]) and the title is already filled ("Debug build time"). For the reviewer, the UI shows the Reviewer button as "Byte Blaze" ([706]), indicating I have already selected myself in the previous step. The remaining step to fulfill the goal is to submit the merge request by clicking the "Create merge request" button. The button is visible as [825]. Therefore, the next best action is to click "Create merge request" to submit the MR.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the “New merge request” page for the project.
- Correct branches selected: Source “debug-build-time” [587] and Target “main” [650].

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path for creating a merge request, but progression is blocked by an error banner stating: “Another open merge request already exists for this source branch: 390.”
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Source branch button “debug-build-time” [587] — visible/selected.
  - Target branch button “main” [650] — visible/selected.
  - Button “Compare branches and continue” — visible and appears enabled.
  - Project navigation link “Merge requests” [361] — visible/enabled; useful for locating the existing MR mentioned by the error.
- Current page indicates a duplicate MR attempt; creating a new MR for this branch is likely disallowed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the project navigation link “Merge requests” [361] to open the MR list, locate the existing MR for the “debug-build-time” branch (referenced by the error), open it, and assign yourself as the reviewer there.

The goal is to submit a merge request for the "debug-build-time" branch into "main" and assign myself as reviewer. On the "New merge request" page, an error alert states: "Another open merge request already exists for this source branch: !390." This indicates GitLab won't allow creating a new MR because one is already open for the same source branch. Therefore, the correct path is to locate and open the existing MR (likely !390) and assign myself (byteblaze) as the reviewer there, and ensure it’s properly submitted. To find that MR, I should navigate to the project’s Merge requests list via the sidebar link, where I can identify !390 and proceed with reviewer assignment. I will click the "Merge requests" link in the left project navigation to access the list.

  - Tabs “Open 18” [553], “Merged 295” [557], “Closed 82” [561], “All 395” [565] — visible/enabled; can scope results to open MRs.
  - Link “New merge request” [578] — visible/enabled, but not appropriate due to the duplicate MR restriction.
  - MR entry links in the list (e.g., [998]) — visible/clickable; after filtering, the link for the target MR (!390) should be opened to manage reviewers.
