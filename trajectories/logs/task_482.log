The user wants me to invite "yjlou" to the dotfiles repository as a guest. Based on the provided tips, to add new members I need to go to the project’s Project information > Members tab and click the blue "invite members" button. First, I need to navigate to the dotfiles repository. I'm on the Projects dashboard listing many projects. Instead of scrolling through multiple pages, it's best to use the on-page "Filter by name" searchbox to quickly find the "dotfiles" repository. The accessibility tree shows a searchbox labeled "Filter by name" with bid 273. I will enter "dotfiles" into this field to filter the list to the repository, after which I can click into it and proceed to the Members section.

The user wants me to invite "yjlou" to the dotfiles repository as a Guest. I am on the Project members page with the "Invite members" modal open. The "Username or email address" field is already filled with "yjlou", and I can see an autocomplete suggestion list with a single menu item "yjlou yjlou". To ensure the system recognizes the correct user account (rather than treating the text as a raw string), I should select the suggested user from the dropdown. The role is already set to "Guest", so after selecting the user, the next step will be to click "Invite". For now, the best single action is to click the suggestion menuitem to add "yjlou" to the invite list.

The goal is to invite user "yjlou" to the dotfiles repository as a Guest. I’m on the Project members page with the “Invite members” modal open. The username field shows that “yjlou” has been selected (the listbox shows an option for yjlou), and the role combobox is already set to Guest. There’s no need to set an expiration date. The next step to complete the invitation is to click the “Invite” button in the modal to submit the invitation.
