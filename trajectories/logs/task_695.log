- Stock Status: In Stock [997]
- Color: Yellow [2324]
- Size: 38 [2343]
The product is enabled [893]. A previous save attempt failed due to a URL Key conflict; I opened the Search Engine Optimization section [1526] and set the URL Key to a unique value: energy-bulk-man-yoga-pant-yellow-38 [2387], which should resolve the conflict mentioned with energy-bulk-man-yoga-pant.html. The next logical step is to click Save to commit the product creation.
