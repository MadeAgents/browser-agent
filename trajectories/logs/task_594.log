The user wants me to create a milestone in the dotfiles GitLab project. Milestones are typically managed under the project's Issues section. On the current page (project overview for Byte Blaze / dotfiles), the left sidebar under "Project navigation" shows a link labeled "Issues" with ID [332]. To proceed, I should navigate to the Issues section, then find the Milestones tab and create a new milestone with the specified start date (5/1/2044) and due date calculated as 20 days after the start (which is 5/21/2044). Since only a single action is allowed per step, my next best action is to click the "Issues" link to get to the area where milestones can be created.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is relevant and on the critical path toward creating a milestone, as milestones are managed under the Issues area. Key interactive elements:
- Link “Milestones” (marker [350]) in the left sidebar, visible and enabled—this is the entry point to manage/create milestones.
- Link “Issues > List” (marker [341]) and “Boards” (marker [344]) are present but not needed for milestones.
- Main content shows “New issue” link (marker [605], enabled) and “Import issues” button (marker [610], enabled), which are unrelated to milestones.

The user asked to create a milestone with specific start and end timing. On GitLab, milestones are managed under the Issues section. The current page shows the project’s Issues area with a sidebar that includes a “Milestones” link (element [350]). To proceed, I should navigate to the Milestones page where I can create a new milestone. After reaching that page, I will look for a “New milestone” button/link, then set the title (e.g., “Add branch for zsh comprehensive support”), description if needed, start date 5/1/2044, and due date 20 days after start, which is 5/21/2044.

The user’s goal is to create a milestone with a start date of 5/1/2044 and an end in 20 days. I’m on the “New Milestone” page for the dotfiles project. The Title field is already set to “Add new branch for zsh comprehensive support,” and the Start Date textbox shows “2044-05-01.” The Due Date textbox ([614]) is currently empty. I need to set the due date to 20 days after May 1, 2044, which is May 21, 2044, using ISO format “2044-05-21.” After setting the due date, I can submit the milestone in the subsequent step. The datepicker overlay is visible for another date field, but I can directly fill the Due Date textbox.

```fill("614", "2044-05-21")```
