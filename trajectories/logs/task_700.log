The user wants a cart price rule that gives a $10 discount at checkout for all customers. I'm on the "New Cart Price Rule" page. The "Rule Name" is already set to "Fall Discount - $10 off," the Website and all Customer Groups are selected, and Coupon is "No Coupon" (automatic application). The remaining step is to configure the "Actions" section to apply a fixed $10 discount to the whole cart. The "Actions" section appears collapsed (strong label at bid 912). I need to expand it to set "Apply" to "Fixed amount discount for whole cart" and enter Discount Amount = 10. Therefore, my next action is to click the "Actions" section header to expand it.
</think>
<action>
```click("912")```

The user wants a $10 discount at checkout for all customers. I’m on the “New Cart Price Rule” page, and the “Actions” section is visible. The “Apply” combobox (bid 938) is currently set to “Percent of product price discount,” but for a checkout-wide $10 off, it must be “Fixed amount discount for whole cart.” I will change this combobox selection directly using the select_option action, which is appropriate for select-style controls and avoids a two-step click to open and then click an option. After this, I will set the Discount Amount to 10 and save.
