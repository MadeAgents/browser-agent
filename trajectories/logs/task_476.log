✅ Current Progress: 
- Navigated to the GitLab “Create new project” page.
- Clicked the “Create from template” heading (element [252]), which does not align with creating an empty repository.
- No repository has been created yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is on the critical path for the goal of creating a new repository.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link “Create blank project” (element [241]) — visible and enabled; correct path to create an empty repository.
  - Link “Create from template” (element [248]) — visible and enabled; not appropriate for an empty repo.
  - Link “Import project” (element [255]) — visible and enabled; not needed for this goal.
  - Link “Show command” (element [263]) — optional CLI instructions; not necessary for the web flow.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link “Create blank project” (element [241]) to proceed with creating an empty repository named “awesome_llm_reading.”
