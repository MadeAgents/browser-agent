The user wants me to follow three users: 'ghost', 'R1kk3r', and 'Abishek'. I'm currently on the Projects dashboard. The global search bar is noted as not working for repository searches; rather than relying on it, a more reliable approach is to directly navigate to each user's profile page using the expected GitLab URL pattern /<username>. From there, I can look for a "Follow" button to complete the action. I'll start with the first user, 'ghost', by going to http://10.177.37.113:8023/ghost, then I will proceed similarly for the other two users after confirming the presence of the follow control.

🔍 Current State Analysis: You are on @R1kk3r’s GitLab profile, which is relevant but this user is already followed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Do not click the “Unfollow” button (node [240]) as it would undo progress.
- Type “Abishek” into the “Search GitLab” textbox (node [112]) and press Enter to find the user’s profile, then follow them on their profile page.

The task is to follow three users: ghost, R1kk3r, and Abishek. From earlier steps, ghost and R1kk3r are already followed. I’m now on the GitLab search results page scoped to users with the query “Abishek.” The results show a single user entry: “Abishek S @abisubramanya27.” To follow this user, I need to open their profile where the Follow button will be available. The accessible, clickable element for the user is the link with id [317] labeled “Abishek S @abisubramanya27.” The next best action is to click this link to navigate to their profile page.

✅ Current Progress: Followed 2 of 3 users: 'ghost' and 'R1kk3r'. Navigated to the profile page of the remaining user (‘Abishek S @abisubramanya27’).

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to complete the goal. It is the user profile for “Abishek S”. Relevant interactive element:
- button “Follow” (id [241]) — visible/focusable; this is the control needed to follow Abishek.
Other elements (e.g., “Followers” link [260], “Following” link [262]) are present but not required to complete the goal.

The goal is to follow three users: ghost, R1kk3r, and Abishek. From prior steps, ghost and R1kk3r already show “Unfollow,” meaning they are followed. I navigated to the profile page for “Abishek S” (@abisubramanya27), and the accessibility tree shows a visible “Follow” button (node [241]). To complete the remaining task, I should click this “Follow” button, which should change to “Unfollow,” confirming the follow action. No scrolling or additional navigation is necessary.
