The user wants the walking time between Carnegie Museum of Art and a library at CMU using the OpenStreetMap site. The best way is to use the built-in directions feature. On the page, I see a link labeled "Find directions between two points" (bid 167) near the search and Go buttons. Clicking this should open the directions pane where I can enter the start and destination. After that, I will enter "Carnegie Museum of Art" as the start and choose a library at CMU—likely "Hunt Library"—as the destination, and set the mode to walking to obtain the time. First, I will click the directions link to open the directions UI.

The user's goal is to find the walking time from Carnegie Museum of Art to a CMU library. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open, with mode set to Foot, and the "From" field contains the full address for Carnegie Museum of Art, while the "To" field contains "Hunt Library, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA". To compute the route, OpenStreetMap typically requires confirming the inputs, often by pressing Enter in the destination field. In the accessibility tree, the "To" textbox [199] is focused, and there isn't a clearly labeled "Go/Press" button in the directions pane (there is a "Reverse Directions" button and a "Close" button). Therefore, the best next action is to trigger the routing by pressing Enter in the "To" field using the press action on bid '199'.

The user wants the walking time from Carnegie Museum of Art to a library at CMU. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open and set to Foot (walking). The From field is correctly filled with the full Carnegie Museum of Art address. The To field currently has “Hunt Library, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA”, but previously a “Search failed” occurred. To improve geocoding success, I’ll refine the destination with a precise street address for Hunt Library at CMU (“4909 Frew Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213”), which should be recognized by OpenStreetMap. After updating the To field, I can trigger routing by pressing Enter in the next step.

The user asks: "How long does it take to walk from Carnegie Museum of Art to a library at CMU?" We’re using the OpenStreetMap directions panel, already set to Foot (walking). The "From" field is filled with the full address of Carnegie Museum of Art. The "To" field has been refined to a precise CMU library address: "Hunt Library, 4909 Frew Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15213". Previously, we had a "Search failed" when using a less specific input, but now the destination is a full address and the To field [199] is focused. To compute the route, we should trigger the routing engine. On OSM, pressing Enter in the destination field typically initiates the route calculation. The interface does not show an explicit "Go" button in the directions panel (only "Reverse Directions"), so pressing Enter is the correct next step. After this, I can read the displayed time/distance from the panel and report it to the user. I will now press Enter in the To field to trigger the calculation.
