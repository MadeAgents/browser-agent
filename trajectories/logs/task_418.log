The user wants to set their GitLab status to Busy. Based on the Task Tips, setting status involves clicking the profile button on the top right (next to the question mark), then selecting "edit status." On the current page, in the header/banner area, there is a link labeled "Byte Blaze" with id [201], which corresponds to the profile/user menu. The logical first step is to click this to open the account dropdown where "Edit status" should be available. I will perform a single click action on the "Byte Blaze" link to open the menu.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the user account menu (“Byte Blaze”) and revealed the status controls.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current GitLab Dashboard page is on the critical path to setting status. The user menu (element [201] link "Byte Blaze") is expanded=True, indicating the dropdown is open. Within this menu, a relevant interactive element is present:
- [211] button "Set status" — visible and enabled (in dropdown under the expanded user menu).
Other menu items shown (for context): [213] "Edit profile", [215] "Preferences", [229] "Sign out". The “Set status” button is the correct next control to reach the status setting dialog and choose “Busy”.

The user's goal is to set their GitLab status to Busy. The Task Tips indicate the status can be set via the profile menu at the top-right. The current page shows the profile menu already expanded (link "Byte Blaze" [201], expanded=True), and within that dropdown there is a button labeled "Set status" (element [211]). To proceed toward selecting the "Busy" status, I should first open the status-setting interface by clicking the "Set status" button.

The user wants to set their GitLab status to Busy. The "Set a status" modal is already open. Inside the modal, there's a checkbox [1150] for "Set yourself as busy" which is currently unchecked. My last attempt to click the checkbox [1150] failed because the label [1151] intercepted the click (as indicated by the timeout error stating the label intercepts pointer events). A common pattern is that clicking the associated label toggles the checkbox. Therefore, I will click the label [1151] to check the "Set yourself as busy" option. After that succeeds, the next step will be to click the "Set status" button [1198] to save, but since only one action is allowed at a time, I will first toggle the busy checkbox via the label.
