The user wants to create a submission in the books forum (r/books) with the title "Harry Potter" and body "Wonderful journey". I’m on the Create submission page where:
- The Title field [137] is required and empty.
- The Body field [142] is empty.
- The Forum combobox [383]/[384] currently shows “Choose one…”.
- The URL radio is selected but the URL input [127] is empty; per tips, I should leave it empty and place all content in the Body.

I need to complete the form by:
1) Filling the Title with "Harry Potter".
2) Filling the Body with "Wonderful journey".
3) Selecting the forum "books" from the combobox.
4) Clicking Create submission.

Since only one action is allowed per step, I will start by filling the Title field [137] with "Harry Potter".
