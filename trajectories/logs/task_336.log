🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to determine the last conditioner purchase. The “Orders” table lists recent orders, and each row provides a way to inspect contents:

- Order #000000196 (Date: 12/16/25) — link “View Order” [1390] (visible/enabled), “Reorder” [1392].

- Additional rows follow with similar “View Order” links to open order details.
To identify when conditioner was last ordered, the agent should open the most recent orders via their “View Order” links and check the item lists for a conditioner. No filters/search within order history are present; inspection must be done per order details.

Goal: Determine the most recent date when the user ordered a conditioner. To do this, I need to inspect order details and find an order containing a conditioner item, then report its date.

Current page: "My Orders" list with the orders table visible. Each row has a "View Order" link. The most efficient approach is to start with the most recent order at the top (Order #000000197, dated 12/16/25) and open it to check the items. If it doesn't contain a conditioner, proceed to the next most recent (000000196), and so on.

History notes: A previous attempt to click a "My Orders" element (bid 1466) timed out because it targeted a gridcell, not the link. Now, I am on the orders list and should click the correct "View Order" link for the top order (bid 1379) to open its details.

Plan: Click "View Order" for order 000000197 (bid 1379), then review the order details for any conditioner item. This is a new action (not repeating the failed gridcell click) and aligns with the task.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is an order detail (“Order # 000000197”), which is on the general path of checking past orders, but this specific order does not contain a conditioner and therefore does not answer the goal.

  - “Items Ordered” table [1374] lists “Atlantic Technology FS-7.0-GLB 7-channel Surround Bar…”, not a conditioner.
- No control on this page to navigate directly to other orders is visible; returning to the orders list is needed to continue the search.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link ‘My Account’ [220] to return to the account dashboard, then navigate to the orders list to open the next most recent order and check for a conditioner.

The user asks for the most recent date they ordered "conditioner." To answer, I need to inspect order details to see which orders contain a conditioner item, starting from the most recent. I’m on the “My Orders” page with a table of orders sorted by date (most recent first). Each order row has a “View Order” link. 

From prior steps, we already opened the topmost order (000000197) and determined it did not contain a conditioner. Therefore, the next best step is to open the next most recent order (000000196, dated 12/16/25) by clicking its “View Order” link to check if it includes a conditioner.

The user needs the date of their most recent conditioner purchase.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to My Orders and opened the last seven orders (#000000197 → #000000191) individually.
- Verified none of these orders contain a conditioner.
- Returned to the My Orders list to continue checking older orders.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is “My Orders,” which is on the critical path to determine when a conditioner was last purchased.
- Orders table [1362] is visible with rows showing Order #, Date, Total, Status, and Action.
- Relevant interactive elements (visible/enabled):
  - “View Order” links in the Action column for each row, used to inspect item details (e.g., for #000000197 link [1379], for #000000196 link [1390], for #000000195 link [1401]).
- To progress toward the goal, continue opening older orders (beyond #000000191) via their “View Order” links and inspect Items Ordered until a conditioner is found.

The user wants the date of their most recent conditioner purchase. The most reliable way is to open orders in reverse chronological order and inspect their items. I’m currently on the “My Orders” page with the orders table visible. I have already checked orders #000000197 through #000000191 and confirmed none included a conditioner. The next most recent order is #000000190 (dated 12/16/25). I should click its “View Order” link to check the items for a conditioner. On this page, the “View Order” link for #000000190 corresponds to bid 1456. I will click that to open the order details.

The user wants to know the most recent date they ordered a conditioner. I’m currently on the detail page for Order #000000190, and the “Items Ordered” table shows products like a table lamp, coat rack, lingerie, candles, V8 energy drink, etc., but no conditioner. I have already checked orders #000000197 through #000000190 and none included a conditioner.
