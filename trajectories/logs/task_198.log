The user needs the customer name of the most recent cancelled order. To find this, I should navigate to the Orders listing where I can filter by order status and sort by Purchase Date (descending), as required by the task tips. From the Dashboard, the logical step is to go to the Sales section which typically contains the Orders grid in Magento. The top menubar has a "SALES" link (bid 156). Clicking that should take me to the Sales area (likely Orders). Once there, I can use filters and sorting. First step: click the Sales menu item.

Objective: Find the customer name of the most recent cancelled order.

Current State:
- We are on Sales > Orders.
- Pagination shows "of 2" with value=1 and the previous page button disabled, confirming we are on the first page.
- The column header shows "↓ Purchase Date", indicating descending sort is active. However, per the rules, we must explicitly perform sorting once later if needed, but first filtering will reduce noise.
- We need the most recent cancelled order, so filtering by Status = Canceled will narrow down the rows and the first (top) row will be the most recent due to the descending order.

Planned Steps:
1) Open Filters panel.
2) Set Status = Canceled.
3) Apply filter.
4) If needed, click the Purchase Date column to ensure sort action is performed at least once (as required).
5) Read the Bill-to Name of the first row and report it.

Goal: Get the customer name of the most recent cancelled order.

Current State Review:

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Sales > Orders grid.
- Opened the Filters panel.
- Set Status filter to “Canceled” via combobox [967] (currently expanded with option [969] selected).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The Orders grid is directly on the critical path to get the most recent cancelled order’s customer name.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Filters toggle button [845] “Filters” — open/visible.
  - Status combobox [967] — value set to “Canceled”, expanded=True, enabled; option [969] selected.
  - Search by keyword textbox [840] — empty, enabled (not required for this task).
  - “Search” button [841] — visible, enabled.
- The grid header shows “↓ Purchase Date” in the screenshot, indicating descending order (newest first). Once the Canceled filter is applied, the first row should be the most recent cancelled order. No deviation detected.

The task is to get the customer name of the most recent cancelled order. I’m on the Orders grid. The Filters panel is open and the Status combobox indicates “Canceled” is selected. To narrow the grid to only canceled orders, I must apply the filter. After filtering, I will still need to explicitly perform a sort action on the Purchase Date column to comply with the rule requiring a descending sort operation to be performed at least once. For now, the immediate next step is to apply the filters so the grid displays only canceled orders, after which I can sort and read the first row’s Bill-to Name.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Sales > Orders grid.
- Applied Status filter to “Canceled” (Active filters show Status: Canceled).
- Confirmed grid is on page 1 with “per page” set to 200, so all results are on a single page.
- Purchase Date column shows “↓ Purchase Date” (descending), positioning the most recent canceled order at the top.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This Orders grid is directly on the critical path to get the most recent canceled order’s customer name.
- Relevant elements and state:
  - Active filter: listitem [9469] “Status: Canceled” (applied); “Clear all” button [852] available.
  - Sorting: columnheader [1380] “↓ Purchase Date” (visible, indicates descending sort).
  - Pagination: spinbutton [1124] “of 1” value=1 with prev [1123] and next [1126] buttons disabled — only one page.
  - Table: table [1358] with headers including “Bill-to Name” [1382]; first data row [1399] is the most recent canceled order (e.g., shows ID cell [1404] “000000291”).
- To obtain the answer, read the “Bill-to Name” cell in the first row of the grid (this cell corresponds to the “Bill-to Name” column [1382] in row [1399]). No deviation detected.

The user needs the customer name of the most recent cancelled order. I am on the Sales > Orders grid with an active filter “Status: Canceled,” and the grid shows 142 records on a single page (per page = 200, pagination of 1 page). The column header shows “↓ Purchase Date,” but the visible data starts at Jan 11, 2022 and then increases (Jan 17, Jan 19, etc.), suggesting the list is actually in ascending order despite the down arrow. According to the benchmark rule, I must explicitly perform a sorting operation and ensure the list is in descending order by Purchase Date to find the most recent item at the top.

Therefore, the next step is to click the Purchase Date column header to (re)sort. After sorting (and if needed, clicking again to ensure descending), I will read the Bill-to Name from the first row. For now, I will perform one click on the Purchase Date header.

- Performed a sort action on the “Purchase Date” column to position the most recent order at the top.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current Orders grid with Status “Canceled” is directly on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant elements:
  - Active filter: listitem [9469] “Status: Canceled” (applied); remove button [9472] available; “Clear all” button [852] visible.
  - Sorting control: columnheader [1380] “Purchase Date” (clickable; recently clicked to sort).
  - Target column: columnheader [1382] “Bill-to Name”.
  - Data table: table [1358]; first data row [1399] is the top (most recent after sorting).
  - Pagination: spinbutton [1124] “of 1” value=1; prev [1123] and next [1126] disabled; per-page textbox [1094] value=200.
- To obtain the answer, read the Bill-to Name value from the first data row [1399] in the grid (under the “Bill-to Name” column [1382]). If the sort indicator on [1380] shows ascending, click it once more to ensure the most recent order remains at the top.
