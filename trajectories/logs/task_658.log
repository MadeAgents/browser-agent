The user needs an issue created with a due date at the end of 2030. I'm on the New Issue page, with the title already filled as "401 bad gateway" and the assignee set to Roshan Jossy. The due date picker is open and currently shows December 2025. To set the due date to the end of 2030 (Dec 31, 2030), I should change the year to 2030 using the year combobox in the date picker, which is element [1061]. Using the select_option action on the year combobox to choose "2030" is the most direct step. After that, I can select day 31 and then click Create issue.
