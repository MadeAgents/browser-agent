The user wants me to create a new forum named "PlantsForCatParents" with a description and sidebar items. I'm on the Postmill homepage, with a "Forums" link available in the top navigation.

The best next step is to click the "Forums" link to navigate to the forum management/listing page, where I can look for a "Create forum" or similar button. I should avoid scrolling per environment instructions and use the most prominent navigation. Clicking "Forums" (bid '42') is the logical next action.

The goal is to create a new forum with specific fields. I'm on the "Create new forum" page, with required fields: Name (already filled with "PlantsForCatParents"), Title (empty), Description (empty), and Sidebar (empty). To proceed systematically, I should fill the remaining required fields. The next immediate step is to fill the Title field (element [121])—since the user didn't specify a separate title, using "PlantsForCatParents" is appropriate and consistent. After that, I will fill Description with "Cat parents & plant lovers" and then populate the Sidebar with the listed items, likely as a Markdown list. For now, perform the next single action: fill the Title field.
