The user asks to update inventory for “Aero daily fitness tee” in brown, setting quantity to 378 in every size. In Magento, this is a configurable product with size and color attributes; inventory is managed per associated simple product (each size/color combination). The best path is to navigate to Catalog > Products, search for “Aero Daily Fitness Tee,” open the configurable product, and update the quantities for all brown variants across each size to 378.

Currently, I’m on the Dashboard. The top menubar includes a “CATALOG” link [189]. The next step is to click “CATALOG” to access the products list where I can search and edit the product configurations and inventory.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to updating inventory. However, the current grid is filtered to an unrelated product (“Nona Fitness Tank”), which prevents locating “Aero Daily Fitness Tee”.

- Relevant interactive elements:
  - textbox “[global] Quantity” (id: 1025) — visible, editable, value: 378.
  - combobox “Stock Status” (id: 1035) — visible, enabled, value: “In Stock”.

The user wants inventory for the brown Aero Daily Fitness Tee set to 378 in every size. I’m currently on the simple product edit page for “Aero Daily Fitness Tee-XL-Brown.” I previously updated the Quantity and clicked Save, and I see the success toast “You saved the product.” The Quantity field [1025] shows 378, so this size is now correct.

To ensure that every brown size is at 378, I should return to the products grid (which was filtered to “Aero Daily Fitness Tee”) and verify the other brown variants (XS, S, M, L). From my earlier scan, those already showed 378, but I should confirm after saving the XL variant. The next logical step is to click the Back button [899] to go back to the product list and verify/update other sizes if needed.

The user requested updating inventory for the brown Aero Daily Fitness Tee to 378 for every size. I navigated to Catalog > Products and filtered for “Aero Daily Fitness Tee.” The products grid shows all size/color variants. I identified the brown variants for XS, S, M, L, and XL. From the grid, XS, S, M, and L were already at 378. I opened XL-Brown, updated its Quantity to 378, and saved successfully. Returning to the products grid, I can confirm all brown variants now display Quantity 378.0000. Since the task is complete, the best next step is to inform the user that inventory has been updated for all brown sizes and provide the variant details to confirm.
