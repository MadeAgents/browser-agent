The user asked to update their address to “222 Redwood Rise, Suite 300, Seattle, WA, 98101.” On the Edit Address page, I see that Street Address Line 1 is already “222 Redwood Rise,” Line 2 is “Suite 300,” Country is “United States,” State/Province is “Washington,” and City is “Seattle.” The Zip/Postal Code field still shows “30303,” which needs to be changed to “98101.” The next step is to update the Zip/Postal Code field, after which I can save the address. I will fill the Zip/Postal Code textbox with “98101.”

The user's goal is to update their address to "222 Redwood Rise, Suite 300, Seattle, WA, 98101" on OneStopShopping. I’m on the Edit Address page where all relevant fields are already set to the requested values:
- Street Address Line 1: 222 Redwood Rise
- Street Address Line 2: Suite 300
- Country: United States
- State/Province: Washington
- City: Seattle
- Zip/Postal Code: 98101
The page also indicates this is the default billing and default shipping address, so saving will update both. The remaining step is to save the changes using the "Save Address" button. I will click the Save Address button to commit the updates.
