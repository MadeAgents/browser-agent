  - Section “Recent Orders” (heading visible). Each row includes a “View Order” link (visible/enabled), but the listed dates shown are recent (e.g., 2025), so this section likely won’t include November 2022 without navigating to full history.

The user needs the total spent in November 2022, factoring in a 20% discount on any cash orders exceeding $200. To calculate this, I must access the full order history and identify orders from November 2022, including their totals and payment methods. On the current "My Account" page, the left sidebar contains a "My Orders" link (bid 1541). The "Recent Orders" table only shows December 2025 entries, so it won't include November 2022. Clicking "My Orders" should navigate to the comprehensive list where I can locate November 2022 orders and gather the necessary details to compute the final amount.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated from My Account to the My Orders page. The orders table is visible, but no orders from November 2022 have been located or opened yet, and no spending calculation has been performed.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal because it lists the user’s order history with per-order “View Order” links to see payment method and full totals (needed to apply the 20% cash discount rule).
- Relevant interactive elements (from the a11y tree):
  - Table “Orders” [1362] with columns “Order #”, “Date”, “Order Total”, “Status”, “Action”.
  - “View Order” links for each row (enabled/visible), e.g.:
    - Row 1: link “View Order” [1379]
    - Row 2: link “View Order” [1390]
    - Row 3: link “View Order” [1401]
- Current rows shown are dated 12/16/25 with “Pending” status and totals like $15.27, $29.99, $55.06, etc., which are not relevant to November 2022. Pagination controls (per the page content: “Items 1 to 10 of 45 total” and page numbers) are present, indicating older orders should be accessible by navigating pages or increasing items per page.
- To compute spending for November 2022 with the discount rule, the agent will need to navigate to orders dated November 2022, open each with “View Order”, confirm payment method (cash vs. other), note the total amount, and apply a 20% discount only if the order total exceeds $200 and was paid in cash.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the My Orders section and navigated through pagination (pages 5 → 4 → 3 → 2) to the November 2022 range. November 2022 orders have been identified in the list (e.g., 11/29/22, 11/24/22, 11/14/22, 11/12/22). No order details have been opened yet; payment methods not verified and no discount-adjusted total calculated.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page (My Orders) is on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - For each November 2022 row, the Action column contains an enabled link labeled “View Order” (visible text: “View Order”).
  - Pagination controls are present and enabled (links labeled “Page 2”, “Page 3”, “Next”, etc.) to reach any remaining November 2022 orders.
- To compute the final amount, the agent must open each November 2022 order via its “View Order” link and check the Payment Method and total. Apply a 20% discount only to orders over $200 that were paid in cash, then sum the adjusted totals.

Task: Determine total spend in November 2022, applying a 20% discount to orders over $200 that were paid in cash. We're on the "My Orders" page. The current accessibility tree and screenshot show we are on Page 2 ("You're currently reading page 2") with dates ranging from January to May 2023, so November 2022 orders won’t be on this page. The logical next page is Page 3, which should include December and November 2022 orders. The prior attempt to click Page 2 timed out because we were already on Page 2. To proceed, I will click the "Page 3" link (bid 1502) to reach the set of orders likely containing November 2022, so I can then open each relevant order to check payment method and totals.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the order detail for a November 2022 purchase. Captured Order #000000164 dated November 26, 2022 with Grand Total $218.17 and Payment Method “Check / Money order.” Other November 2022 orders have not yet been opened or evaluated.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This order detail page is directly on the critical path to determining November 2022 spending with conditional discounts.
- Key data on this page:
  - Order Date: “November 26, 2022” (visible in header).
  - Grand Total: “$218.17” [element labeled Grand Total, marker id ~1452], visible.
  - Payment Method: “Check / Money order” [Payment Method section, visible], readable.
- Relevant interactive elements to proceed:
  - Link “My Account” [220], visible/enabled (can navigate back to access My Orders list).
  - Link “Reorder” [1363], visible/enabled (not required for the goal).
  - Link “Print Order” [1365], visible/enabled (optional).
- Analysis toward goal: We have verified one November order that exceeds $200 and identified its payment method. To complete the goal, all November 2022 orders (e.g., 11/20/22, 11/11/22 seen earlier on My Orders page) must be opened to read their totals and payment methods, then apply the 20% discount only to those over $200 paid in cash, and sum the adjusted totals.

🔍 Current State Analysis: 
- Page relevance: We are on the “My Orders” page (critical path), but the current list shows recent orders (e.g., 12/16/25), not November 2022.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Orders table “Orders” with per-row “View Order” links (e.g., [1379], [1390], [1401]) — visible and enabled.
  - Pagination controls at the bottom with links by visible text: “Page 1” (current), “Page 2”, “Page 3”, “Page 4”, “Page 5”, and “Next” — visible/enabled. “Page 3” is where the November 2022 orders were previously observed.
- Assessment: On-track section but wrong page for the target month; need to page to November 2022 results to finish collecting totals for all November orders (e.g., 11/20/22, 11/11/22). Only orders over $200 paid in cash qualify for the 20% discount; the 11/26/22 order (> $200) was not cash.

The user needs the total spent in November 2022, applying a 20% discount only to orders over $200 paid in cash. On the My Orders page (page 3), the list shows three November 2022 orders:

- 11/20/22: $133.07
- 11/11/22: $51.94

I opened the 11/26/22 order detail earlier and confirmed the Payment Method is “Check / Money order,” not cash, so the 20% discount does not apply. The other two orders are under $200, so they don’t qualify for the discount regardless of payment method.

Thus, the November total is the sum of the three order totals with no discounts applied:
218.17 + 133.07 + 51.94 = 403.18.

Per the instructions, I should return just the decimal amount.

- 11/11/22: $51.94

I opened the 11/26/22 order detail earlier and confirmed the Payment Method is “Check / Money order,” not cash, so the 20% discount does not apply. The other two orders are under $200, so they don’t qualify for the discount regardless of payment method.

Thus, the November total is the sum of the three order totals with no discounts applied:
218.17 + 133.07 + 51.94 = 403.18.

Per the instructions, I should return just the decimal amount.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (My Orders, pagination page 3) is on the critical path and displays all visible November 2022 orders.
- Relevant interactive elements (visible/enabled):
  - Orders table “Orders” with per-row “View Order” links:
    - Row dated “11/26/22” ($218.17) — “View Order” opened earlier; detail page shows Payment Method “Check / Money order.”
    - Rows dated “11/20/22” ($133.07) and “11/11/22” ($51.94) — “View Order” links present; totals below $200 so discount would not trigger regardless of payment method.
- No additional November 2022 entries are indicated beyond these three on this page; pagination shows older months on page 4+ and newer months on page 2, consistent with November being fully captured here.
