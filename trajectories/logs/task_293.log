The user wants the SSH clone command for the repository named "Super_Awesome_Robot". From the current dashboard page, the easiest way to locate a specific repository is to use the GitLab search. However, the general search bar is noted as non-functional in this environment, and the tips instruct to use a specific search URL pattern instead. Therefore, the next best step is to navigate directly to the GitLab search results page using the provided URL template: http://10.177.37.113:8023/search?search=<repository-name>&nav_source=navbar. I will replace <repository-name> with Super_Awesome_Robot and go to that page. Once there, I can click into the repository and find the clone dropdown to extract the SSH URL (and from that, produce the "git clone" command). For now, I need to execute a single action, so I will navigate to the search results page.

The user's goal is to get the SSH clone command for the repository "Super_Awesome_Robot". I'm currently on the GitLab search results page showing a project result "Convex Eggtart / Super_Awesome_Robot". To retrieve the SSH clone URL, I should navigate into the repository page where the "Clone" dropdown or panel typically provides both HTTP and SSH URLs. From there, I'll look for the SSH option and either read the full URL or use the copy button and paste it into a visible input if it's truncated. The immediate next step is to click the project link to open the repository page.
