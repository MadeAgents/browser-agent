The user wants directions from SCS CMU in Pittsburgh to the location where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were signed, which is Independence Hall in Philadelphia. On OpenStreetMap, the best way is to use the directions tool rather than the general search. The accessibility tree shows a "Find directions between two points" link with id [167], which corresponds to the directions icon (two arrows). Clicking this should open the directions panel with "From" and "To" fields, allowing me to input the start and end locations. Therefore, the next step is to click that directions link to bring up the route input interface.

The goal is to display a route from SCS CMU (School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh to the location where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were signed (Independence Hall in Philadelphia). The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with "From" and "To" textboxes identified as [194] and [199]. The recommended workflow is to fill these fields and then trigger routing (likely by pressing Enter or an implicit compute). Since only one action is allowed per step, I will start by filling the "From" field with a clear query that should match the correct place in Pittsburgh: "SCS CMU Pittsburgh, PA". After that, I will fill the "To" field with "Independence Hall, Philadelphia, PA" and then trigger the routing computation. For now, the next best step is to fill the From field.

The user wants to show the route from SCS CMU in Pittsburgh to the place where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were signed (Independence Hall, Philadelphia). The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with Car mode and OSRM selected. The "From" textbox shows a resolved, full CMU address, and the "To" textbox is focused with “Independence Hall, Philadelphia, PA.” No route has been computed yet. On OSM, triggering routing typically happens by pressing Enter in the destination field. Therefore, the next best step is to press Enter on the "To" field to compute and display the route.

The panel shows the error “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” We have already tried Valhalla and OSRM and pressed Enter to recompute. A common workaround is switching to another routing engine; GraphHopper is available in the same combobox. Selecting GraphHopper often successfully computes routes when other engines fail. Changing the combobox usually triggers recomputation automatically. Therefore, the next best single action is to select GraphHopper in the Directions services combobox.

The user needs a route from SCS CMU in Pittsburgh to the site where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were signed (Independence Hall, Philadelphia). The OSM directions panel is already open with:
- From: “Carnegie Mellon University, Hamerschlag Drive, … Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States”
- To: “Independence Hall, 520, Chestnut Street, … Philadelphia, PA 19106, United States”
Car mode is selected, but all three routing engines tried (Valhalla, OSRM, GraphHopper) returned “Couldn't find a route between those two places.”

A common reason routing fails is that the start point snaps to a non-drivable feature or is poorly connected. Using a more canonical street address right on a main road can help. For CMU/SCS, “5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213” is the main address fronting a primary road and typically geocodes cleanly. I’ll replace the From field with this address to get a better routable point. After that, I can trigger recomputation by pressing Enter on the To field, but since only one action is allowed per step, I’ll first correct the From field.
