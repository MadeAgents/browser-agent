The user wants walking directions from "401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh" to the closest Amazon-owned grocery, which would be a Whole Foods Market. On OpenStreetMap, the best way to create routes is to use the directions tool, which is indicated as the "two arrow button" next to the Go button. The accessibility tree lists a link labeled "Find directions between two points" with bid 167, which matches that tool. To proceed efficiently, I should first open the directions panel using this link; once open, I can enter the origin and destination and then select walking mode. Since only a single action is allowed per step, I will click the directions link now to bring up the route input fields.

The user's goal is to find a walking route (“walkway”) from “401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh” to the nearest grocery owned by Amazon. In Pittsburgh, the Amazon-owned grocery brand is Whole Foods Market (no Amazon Fresh locally as of 2022). The OpenStreetMap directions pane is already open, with three transport mode radios: Car (checked), Bicycle, and Foot. To ensure the route is for walking, I should first select the Foot mode. After that, I will fill the From field with “401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh, PA” and the To field with “Whole Foods Market, Pittsburgh” so OSM can resolve to the nearest Whole Foods (likely 5880 Centre Ave). Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best action is to click the Foot radio ([179]) to switch the routing profile to walking.

- Page is on the critical path (routing interface is active and a walking route is displayed).

The current route is set to a Whole Foods in Upper St. Clair (111 Siena Drive), which is far (22km) from 401 Shady Ave in Shadyside.

The current route is set to a Whole Foods in Upper St. Clair (111 Siena Drive), which is far (22km) from 401 Shady Ave in Shadyside.

However, the route currently displayed is 22km, clearly incorrect for this nearby destination, and an earlier attempt to press Enter on the “To” field produced a “Search failed” modal which I closed. To avoid repeating an action that led to an error, I should refine the destination query. Using the plain street address without the “Whole Foods Market” label often improves geocoding reliability.
