 <think>
The user wants me to follow three specific users on GitLab. To follow users, I need to access user profile pages or a users exploration page where I can search for them and click a Follow button.

The current page is the Projects dashboard and doesn't have obvious user exploration. The benchmark tip warns not to use the global search bar because it's broken, especially for repository search. A reliable path in GitLab is the Explore Users page, typically located at /explore/users. From there, I can search for each user and follow them.

Therefore, my next step is to navigate directly to the Explore Users page using the URL, which should present a user list and search capability.

✅ Current Progress: No progress made yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is a GitLab 404 “Page Not Found,” which is off the critical path to following users. Relevant interactive elements present:
- searchbox labeled “Search for projects, issues, etc.” (node [15]) — visible, empty, focusable.
- button “Search” (node [16]) — visible, enabled.
- link “Home” (node [21]) — visible, clickable.
- link “Sign out and sign in with a different account” (node [23]) — visible, clickable.
- link “Help” (node [26]) — visible, clickable.
This page does not provide user profiles or follow controls; recovery navigation is needed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the link “Home” (node [21]) to return to the main dashboard and access user discovery from there.
- Alternatively, type “Jakub Klinkovský” into the searchbox (node [15]) and click the “Search” button (node [16]) to locate the user profile.
