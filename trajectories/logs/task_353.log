The user wants a list of products from the competitive swimwear category sorted by ascending price. To access that category, I should use the top navigation dropdowns as per the tips. The "Sports & Outdoors" menu (bid 618) likely contains swim-related subcategories including competitive swimwear. The first step is to hover over "Sports & Outdoors" to reveal its submenu options. Once the submenu appears, I can locate and click on "Competitive Swimwear," then apply a sort by ascending price if available and list the products. Therefore, I will start by hovering over the "Sports & Outdoors" menu item.

✅ Current Progress: Hovered over the “Sports & Outdoors” top navigation to reveal its submenu. No products from the competitive swimwear category listed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page (home with main navigation open) is on the critical path toward the goal. The relevant interactive elements to reach the competitive swimwear category are:
- Menu item “Sports & Outdoors” [618], hasPopup=menu, visible/enabled.
- Submenu items now visible/enabled under [621]:
  - “Hunting & Fishing” [623]
  - “Exercise & Fitness” [631]
  - “Fan Shop” [634]
  - “Sports & Outdoor Recreation Accessories” [645]
  - “Sports” [653] — most likely to lead to swimming/competitive swimwear.
Other elements (e.g., product showcases, disabled “Search” button [391]) are not directly relevant to the goal at this stage. The search combobox [386] is present but the “Search” button is currently disabled. The page is not off-track.

- Breadcrumbs: “Home” [1181] → “Sports & Outdoors” [1183] → “Sports” [1185]; “Sports & Outdoors” [1183] is a clickable link to navigate up.
- Top navigation: “Sports & Outdoors” menuitem [388] (hasPopup) with submenu items visible: “Hunting & Fishing” [392], “Exercise & Fitness” [399], “Fan Shop” [402], “Sports & Outdoor Recreation Accessories” [412], “Sports” [419]. None explicitly lead to “Competitive Swimwear” from this view.
- Sorting controls on this page: Combobox “Sort By” [1224], current value “Position”; option “Price” [1227] is available. Link “Set Descending Direction” [1228] (visible; would switch to descending if clicked). Sorting here would only affect the broad Sports category, not the required subcategory.
- Search controls: Combobox “Search” [167] (empty, visible), “Search” button [172] (currently disabled), “Advanced Search” link [170] (enabled).

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click breadcrumb link “Sports & Outdoors” [1183] to go up one level and locate the “Competitive Swimwear” subcategory from the category landing page.
- If the subcategory still isn’t exposed via navigation, type “Competitive Swimwear” into the search field [167] and then click the Search button [172] once enabled.

Goal: List products from the Competitive Swimwear category sorted by ascending price.

Current page: Sports category (Sports & Outdoors > Sports) with a general product grid and a Sort By control. This isn’t the Competitive Swimwear subcategory. The top navigation submenu under “Sports & Outdoors” does not expose a direct “Competitive Swimwear” or deeper “Swimming” option from this view (items visible: Hunting & Fishing, Exercise & Fitness, Fan Shop, Sports & Outdoor Recreation Accessories, Sports). Clicking “Sports” leads to the broad listing we’re on.

Given the absence of a visible nested submenu for “Swimming/Competitive Swimwear,” the most efficient way forward is to use the on-site search to reach the Competitive Swimwear category page. Once on that category page, I can switch Sort By to Price and ensure ascending order.

Next step: Enter “Competitive Swimwear” into the site search field to navigate to the relevant category/results.

✅ Current Progress: Entered “Competitive Swimwear” into the site search field. Search suggestions are open. Still on the broad “Sports” category page; no price sorting applied.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page (Sports category listing) is not the target “Competitive Swimwear” category, so it’s off the direct path to the goal.
- Relevant elements:
  - Search field combobox labeled “Search” [167]: value set to “Competitive Swimwear”, focused, visible, enabled; hasPopup menu, expanded.
  - Search suggestions listbox [2193]: contains option “Competitive Swimwear” [2194], visible, selectable (currently not selected).
  - “Search” button [172]: visible and enabled.
  - Sorting controls on this page: “Sort By” combobox [1224] with option “Price” [1227] and “Set Descending Direction” link [1228]; sorting here would affect the Sports category, not the required subcategory.
- Breadcrumbs show “Sports & Outdoors” link [1183] to navigate up, but the filled search is the most direct route to the specific category.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the suggestion option “Competitive Swimwear” [2194] to navigate to that category.
- If the suggestion is not clickable, click the “Search” button [172] to execute the search for “Competitive Swimwear”; once on that category page, change “Sort By” to “Price” and ensure ascending order.

This page shows mixed items (e.g., non-swimwear), confirming it’s search results rather than the category.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Select 'Price' option [1503] in the Sort By combobox [1501].

Objective: Provide a list of products from the Competitive Swimwear category sorted by ascending price.

Current state: I’m on a generic search results page for "Competitive Swimwear," which contains unrelated items (TVs, PCs). This doesn't satisfy the requirement to list items from the specific category. The top navigation shows a vertical menu where "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry" > "Sport Specific Clothing" is expanded, and within it, I can see the "Competitive Swimwear" menu item (bid 606). To reach the correct category page, I should click this "Competitive Swimwear" item. Once on that category page, I can ensure sorting is set to Price in ascending order and then list the products.

Next step: Click the "Competitive Swimwear" menu item to navigate to the category page.

The goal is to list products from the Competitive Swimwear category sorted by ascending price. I’m already on the correct category page (“Competitive Swimwear - Sport Specific Clothing - Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry”). I see the “Sort By” combobox (bid 1139) currently set to “Position” with options including “Price.” There’s also a link labeled “Set Descending Direction” (bid 1143), which indicates the current sort direction is ascending (since clicking it would switch to descending). To achieve the desired result, I should change the sort field to “Price,” which will keep the current ascending direction. After the page updates, I can then read off the products in ascending price order.
