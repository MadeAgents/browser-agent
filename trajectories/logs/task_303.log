The user asks for the number of commits Kilian made during 2023 in the current GitLab project. To find this, I should navigate to a view that allows filtering commits by author and date. The GitLab project navigation shows a "Repository" link, and per the tips, the repository tab has menus like Commits and Contributors. The Contributors tab can show total commits per contributor, but I need a specific year (2023), so a commits list with filters is more appropriate. First, I’ll click "Repository" to reach the repository overview where I can access the Commits/Contributors tabs. From there, I can proceed to the Commits page and filter by author "Kilian" and set the date range to 2023.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the repository but still viewing the Files page; no commits have been filtered or counted yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is relevant to the goal but not yet the commits listing. From the sidebar under “Repository,” the essential navigation item is:
- link “Commits” (id 312) — visible and enabled; leads to the commit history where author and date can be assessed.
Other potentially useful items:
- link “Contributors” (id 321) — visible and enabled; shows contributor totals but not restricted to 2023.
- button “main” (id 621) — visible, enabled; branch selector (currently main), relevant if commits must be filtered by branch.
The main content shows a file listing and a recent commit entry, but it does not provide per-author/year counts directly.

No deviation detected; continue by applying the author filter to Kilian, then review 2023 entries to count.

The agent prematurely reported a result without applying the author filter; the current view still shows mixed authors. A correction is needed to ensure accuracy.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the menu item labeled “Kilian Valkhof” within the Author menu (id 807) to apply the author filter.
