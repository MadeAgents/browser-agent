The user asks for the number of commits Nic made in April 2021 within the GitLab project currently open. To find this, I should navigate to the repository’s commits view and then filter by author and date. On GitLab, the "Repository" section typically contains sub-items like Files, Commits, Branches, Tags, and Contributors. From the current page, I am on the repository file view, but I don’t see the commits tab directly; the left sidebar shows a "Repository" link (bid 301) which usually expands or navigates to a sub-navigation where "Commits" will be accessible. The best next step is to click "Repository" to expose the sub-menu and then proceed to the "Commits" page in subsequent steps, where I can filter by author "Nic" and the date range April 2021 to count the commits.

The task is to find how many commits “Nic” made in April 2021. I’m currently on the Commits page with the Author filter open and “Nic” typed into the search field, but this page requires pagination to reach 2021, and the environment discourages scrolling. A more efficient path is to use the “Contributors” tab, which (per the tips) shows contributors and their number of commits and typically allows setting date ranges to get counts for specific months. From the left sidebar under Repository, there’s a “Contributors” link (bid 313). Navigating there should provide a chart or filterable list that can be constrained to April 2021 and filtered by the author Nic, enabling me to read off the commit count directly without needing to paginate through years of commits.

  - Multiple contributor sections are visible, each titled with the contributor’s name and containing a “Commits to main” time-series chart; locate the section whose visible title is “Nic”.
- On-track: The Contributors analytics view is on the critical path. To obtain the exact count, identify the “Nic” contributor section and read the April 2021 value from its chart (typically via the chart’s hover tooltip for the April 2021 point).

✅ Current Progress:
- Previously opened the Commits view and started filtering by author “Nic,” but navigated away.
- Currently back on the repository Files view; the commit count for April 2021 has not been determined.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is the repository Files view for branch “main.” It is adjacent to the needed information but does not show commit lists or contributor statistics directly.
- Relevant interactive elements to proceed:
  - Link “History” (id: 871) — visible, enabled; should navigate to the commit list.
  - Branch selector button “main” (id: 621) — visible, enabled; confirms we’re on the correct branch.
  - Left sidebar link “Analytics” (id: 476) — visible, enabled; leads to project analytics (including contributors).
- The page is not directly on the critical path but provides clear navigation to either the commit history or analytics needed to find Nic’s April 2021 commit count.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:

The user's goal is to count Nic's commits in April 2021. We're on the Commits page for the "main" branch, and the Author filter dropdown is already open. The author search field inside the menu is populated with "Nic", but the only visible menu item in the accessibility tree is "Any Author", which suggests the list of matching authors may not yet be narrowed enough or the specific author entry isn't in focus. To improve the match and surface the specific author entry, I'll refine the search to "Nic Steenhout", which is a likely full name for "Nic" in accessibility circles.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the project’s Commits page for branch “main.”
- Opened the Author filter and entered “Nic Steenhout” in the author search field.
- No author has been selected yet; commits remain unfiltered and April 2021 is not in view.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path to the goal (commit history with author filtering).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Button “Author” (id: 805) — visible, enabled, expanded=True.
  - Menu “Author” (id: 808) — open.
  - Searchbox “Search” in Author menu (id: 817) — focused, value='Nic Steenhout'.
  - Menuitem “Any Author” (id: 820) — visible, focusable; selecting it would not apply an author filter.
  - Button “Clear” (id: 2002) — visible; would reset the author search field.
  - Branch selector “main” (id: 593) — confirms branch context.
  - “Search by message” field (id: 865) — visible, currently empty.
- Commit list shows recent dates (e.g., “14 Mar, 2023”); April 2021 is not yet reached. Selecting the author and then navigating to the April 2021 date group will be necessary. No deviation detected.

The task is to determine how many commits "Nic" made in April 2021. I’m currently on the Commits page with the Author filter dropdown open and the search field filled with "Nic Steenhout," but the author isn’t selected yet, and the commit list still shows recent entries. Scrolling isn't supported, and moving through years via pagination would be inefficient.

Given the benchmark tips, the Contributors tab shows contributors and their commit counts and typically supports date range filtering, which is ideal for getting a count for a specific month. The left sidebar includes a "Repository" link that leads to a section where the "Contributors" page is accessible. To get to a view where I can set a date range and see Nic’s commit count for April 2021, I should navigate to the Repository section first, then proceed to Contributors.

Therefore, the next best action is to click the "Repository" link in the left sidebar to navigate to the repository’s section, where I can access the Contributors tab.

✅ Current Progress:
- Previously navigated to the Commits page and opened the Author filter; typed “Nic”/“Nic Steenhout” in the author search field.
- Author has not been selected; date range not set. Current view is back on the Files page.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (Files view for branch “main”) is adjacent to the critical path; it provides a “History” link to reach the commits list.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link “History” (id: 871) — visible, enabled; navigates to the commits list.
  - Branch selector “main” (id: 621) — visible; confirms branch context.
  - Links “Find file” (id: 873) and “Web IDE” (id: 876) — visible but not relevant to counting commits.
- Current page does not show commit filters; the needed author/date filtering is available after navigating to commit history. The last action moved off the commits page, causing a detour.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link “History” (id: 871) to return to the commits list and proceed with author/date filtering to isolate April 2021 commits by Nic.

The goal is to find how many commits “Nic” made in April 2021. I’m currently on the Commits page for the main branch, but there’s no obvious date filter visible and reaching 2021 via pagination could require scrolling, which isn’t supported here. A more efficient route per the tips is the Repository’s Contributors tab, which typically offers time range filters to get counts for specific periods.

From the current page’s sidebar, the “Repository” link (bid 292) should take me to the repository section where the top sub-navigation includes “Contributors.” Once there, I can set the time range to April 2021 and focus on Nic to read off the commit count directly. A previous click attempt timed out on an incorrect element, so I’ll avoid repeating that and instead navigate to the Repository section first to access Contributors.

The user wants the number of commits Nic made in April 2021. I’m on the repository’s Commits page for branch “main,” which is the right place to filter by author. The page shows an “Author” filter button (bid 805). My last attempt to click this button timed out, so I should avoid repeating the same click action. A viable alternative is to use the keyboard to activate the button via the “press” action, which focuses the element and sends a key event. Pressing Enter on the Author button should open the dropdown, allowing me to search for “Nic” and then filter commits to that author before navigating to April 2021. Therefore, I will press Enter on the Author button to open the filter menu.

The user asks for the number of commits Nic made in April 2021. I’m on the Commits page for branch “main,” and the Author filter dropdown is currently open (Author button shows expanded). Within this dropdown, there’s a search box labeled “Search” (bid 817), which is designed to filter authors by name. The visible author list doesn’t currently show “Nic,” so using the search box to filter for “Nic” is the logical next step. This should surface the relevant author entry (e.g., Nic Steenhout) so I can select it and then proceed to navigate to the April 2021 timeframe to count commits. Since only one action is allowed now, I will enter “Nic” into the Author search field.

The user asks how many commits Nic made in April 2021. I’m currently on the repository Files view for the main branch of The A11Y Project. To count commits by a specific author and date, I should open the repository’s commit history, which provides filters like Author and potentially date range. The page shows a “History” link (bid 877) near the top of the file listing. Clicking “History” will navigate to the commit list where I can then apply the author filter for Nic and locate April 2021 commits to count. Since only one action is allowed, the best next step is to click the “History” link.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the repository’s Commits page for branch “main.”
- Opened the Author filter previously and typed “Nic,” but the author selection has not been applied yet; the commit list remains unfiltered.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (“Commits · main”) is on the critical path to determine Nic’s commits in April 2021.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Button “Author” (id: 811) — visible; collapsed (expanded=False); needed to filter commits by author.
  - Searchbox “Search by message” (id: 871) — visible; empty; not directly useful for author filtering.
  - Button “main” (id: 599) — branch selector; currently set to “main.”
  - Commit list items (e.g., listitem showing “14 Mar, 2023”; id: 877) — visible; indicates current view is not yet at April 2021.
- No off-track indicators; the page is correct. To progress, apply the Author filter to “Nic,” then navigate to the April 2021 timeframe and count the commits.

To filter commits by Nic, I need to select the matching author from the Author dropdown. A reliable way in GitLab’s filter menus is to press Enter in the search field to select the top matching author. This differs from the last action (ArrowDown on the “Any Author” item) and should apply the author filter. Once the author is selected, I can then proceed with date range narrowing (likely via pagination or by attempting URL parameters) to reach April 2021 and count the commits.
