✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Marketing > User Content > Reviews (All Reviews) grid.
- Entered “Pursuit Tone Band” in the Product filter and executed Search.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to identify customer dislikes for a specific product via its reviews.
- The reviews grid currently shows “0 records found,” indicating no reviews matched the Product filter.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Product filter textbox under “Product” (id: 839) — visible, filled with “Pursuit Tone Band”.
  - Search button (id: 700) — visible and enabled; last action applied the current filter.
  - Reset Filter button (id: 703) — visible and enabled; can clear filters to try alternative queries.
  - Created date range fields “From” (id: 804) and “To” (id: 808) — visible, empty.
  - Status combobox (id: 814) — visible, no value selected (not restricting).
- No deviation detected; however, no matching reviews are returned with the current product filter, so additional filtering strategies may be needed to surface relevant reviews.

The user asks for the key aspects customers don’t like about the product “Pursuit Tone Band.” I’m on Marketing > User Content > All Reviews. The grid currently shows “0 records found” while the Product filter textbox already contains “Pursuit Tone Band,” meaning either there are no reviews for that exact product name or the filter is too restrictive/stale. Before concluding, I should clear filters and try a broader product keyword to surface any related reviews (e.g., “Pursuit”) and then narrow down to the specific product if present. The appropriate next step in the UI is to click “Reset Filter” to repopulate the grid, after which I can try a partial match and reapply search.

- Reset filters; currently viewing the full reviews list.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The Reviews grid is the correct place to identify customer feedback for the target product; we are on the critical path.
- Grid status: “351 records found” (unfiltered list across many products; target product not yet isolated).
- Relevant interactive elements to progress:
  - Product filter textbox under “Product” (id: 839) — visible and currently empty after Reset.
  - Search button (id: 700) — visible and enabled.
  - Reset Filter button (id: 703) — visible and enabled.
  - Other helpful filters present in the header row (e.g., Status combobox under “Status” (id: 815), date range “From/To” (ids: 805/809)) — all visible and unset.
- Observation: Exact product-name filtering returned no matches, suggesting the product may be named slightly differently in the catalog (e.g., variant or partial name). The page is ready for a broader/partial product filter to locate the correct reviews.

The user wants to identify what customers don’t like about the product “Pursuit Tone Band.” I’m on the Magento Admin Reviews grid (MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews). Previously, searching for the exact product name “Pursuit Tone Band” returned 0 results, suggesting either the name differs slightly in the catalog or the filter requires a broader query. The grid is currently reset and shows 351 records. The most efficient next step is to use the Product filter field to enter a broader keyword like “Pursuit,” then apply the search to narrow the results. Once filtered, I can refine further (e.g., by “Tone” or “Band”), locate the specific product reviews, and extract the negative aspects from the review titles and texts. Therefore, I will fill the Product filter textbox (bid 839) with “Pursuit” to start narrowing down results.
