The user wants to know, as of 6/12/2023, how many fulfilled orders they have over the past year and the total amount spent. To find this, I should navigate to the user's order history. The page header shows a "My Account" link (bid 227). Per the site tips, order information is under My Account > My Orders. The next logical step is to click "My Account" to access the account dashboard, then find the orders section. From there, I can identify orders with a fulfilled status (likely "Complete" on Magento) and within the date range from 6/12/2022 to 6/12/2023, and sum the totals.

✅ Current Progress: Landed on the My Account dashboard. No order data has been gathered or analyzed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal because it provides navigation to order history. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link labeled “My Orders” (left sidebar; visible and enabled) — this should lead to the full order history where fulfillment status and dates can be reviewed.
- “Recent Orders” section (main area) with per-row “View Order” links (visible and enabled). Current visible statuses appear as “Pending,” which are not “fulfilled,” so this section alone is insufficient for the past-year fulfilled count/total.
- Other links like “View Order” in each recent order row are actionable but only show individual orders and not the complete list for the 6/12/2022–6/12/2023 range.

The page is relevant, but to complete the task (count fulfilled orders in the past year and sum spend), the agent needs to navigate to the full order history via “My Orders,” then filter or scan for fulfilled/complete orders within 6/12/2022–6/12/2023.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal. The orders table shows columns “Order #”, “Date”, “Order Total”, “Status”, and “Action.” Current visible rows show dates like “12/16/25” and statuses “Pending” (and one “Canceled”), which are outside the target timeframe (6/12/2022–6/12/2023) and not fulfilled. Relevant interactive elements:
- Per-row “View Order” links (e.g., link labeled “View Order” at [1379], [1390], [1401]) — visible and enabled; open individual order details.
- Per-row “Reorder” links (e.g., [1381], [1392], [1403]) — visible and enabled (not needed for the goal).
- The screenshot shows pagination controls and a “Show 10 per page” selector near “Items 1 to 10 of 45 total,” which are visible and likely enabled; these are essential to reach older orders within 6/12/2022–6/12/2023 for counting fulfilled orders and summing totals.

Goal: As of 6/12/2023, determine how many fulfilled orders (likely status “Complete”) occurred between 6/12/2022 and 6/12/2023, and compute the total amount spent. We’re on the “My Orders” page with a paginated orders table sorted by date descending. Page 1 shows many 12/16/25 pending orders and two 2023 orders: 5/17/23 (Canceled) and 5/2/23 (Pending). Neither counts as fulfilled.

Next step: Navigate to Page 2 via the pagination control to view older orders that likely include more 2023 and possibly late 2022 entries within the target window. Then we can identify rows with status “Complete” and sum totals. Per tips, using pagination is key; do not scroll.

🔍 Current State Analysis:

- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Per-row “View Order” links (visible text: “View Order”; examples in axtree: [1379], [1390], [1401]) — visible and usable for drilling into details if needed.
  - Pagination controls near “Items 11 to 20 of 45 total / Show 10 per page” — needed to continue to older orders to include late 2022 within the 6/12/2022–6/12/2023 range.

  - Pagination controls near “Items 21 to 30 of 45 total / Show 10 per page” are available to access additional orders (needed to cover June–Nov 2022 and confirm all Jan–Jun 2023).
- No errors or off-track navigation detected; continue paginating and aggregating “Complete” orders dated between 6/12/2022 and 6/12/2023 to produce the final count and total spend.

The user wants the count of fulfilled orders and the total amount spent over the past year as of 6/12/2023 (i.e., from 6/12/2022 to 6/12/2023). On Magento, “fulfilled” most likely corresponds to orders with status “Complete.”

I’m currently on the “My Orders” page, on page 3 (Items 21–30 of 45). The table lists orders with dates, totals, and statuses. From the visible rows on page 3, I can already identify multiple “Complete” orders dated Oct–Dec 2022, which fall within the target window:
- 12/18/22 $97.15 Complete
- 12/14/22 $20.49 Complete
- 12/12/22 $53.29 Complete
- 12/4/22 $32.47 Complete
- 11/26/22 $218.17 Complete
- 11/20/22 $133.07 Complete
- 11/11/22 $51.94 Complete
- 10/22/22 $845.07 Complete
- 10/21/22 $345.84 Complete
- 10/18/22 $2,126.32 Canceled (does not count)

So page 3 contributes 9 fulfilled orders. To complete the one-year span, I need to gather:
- All “Complete” orders from 2023 up to 6/12/2023 (likely on Page 2).
- Any earlier “Complete” orders from June–September 2022 (likely on Pages 4 and possibly 5).

The last attempted action tried clicking the current page indicator (strong “You’re currently reading page 3”), which timed out and wouldn’t navigate anyway.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the “My Orders” page and paginated to Page 2 (showing “Items 11 to 20 of 45 total”) and Page 3.
- On Page 2 (early 2023), identified fulfilled (“Complete”) orders within the target window (6/12/2022–6/12/2023):
  - 3/11/23 — $65.32 — Complete
  - 3/10/23 — $17.99 — Complete
  - 2/27/23 — $762.18 — Complete
  - 2/9/23 — $185.32 — Complete
  - 1/29/23 — $440.64 — Complete
  - 1/16/23 — $132.24 — Complete
- On Page 3 (late 2022), previously observed multiple “Complete” orders (e.g., several in Dec/Nov/Oct 2022), which fall within the one-year window.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is directly on the critical path toward the goal: it lists orders with Date, Order Total, and Status needed to count “Complete” orders and sum totals for 6/12/2022–6/12/2023.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Orders table “Orders” (columns: “Order #”, “Date”, “Order Total”, “Status”, “Action”) is visible and populated; “View Order” links in each row are enabled (e.g., link labeled “View Order” within the Action column).
  - Pagination controls near the table footer (“Items 11 to 20 of 45 total” / “Show 10 per page”) are visible; page navigation links are present (e.g., Page 3 link id=1502) to access older orders needed to cover the full year.
- No errors or off-track navigation detected; continuing to paginate and aggregate “Complete” orders dated between 6/12/2022 and 6/12/2023 will produce the final count and total spend.

The user’s question is date-bound: as of 6/12/2023, count fulfilled orders (interpreting fulfilled as status “Complete” per Magento conventions) in the past year (6/12/2022–6/12/2023) and sum their totals. I’m on the “My Orders” page showing “Items 11 to 20 of 45 total” with pagination indicating I’m currently on Page 2. The table shows dates and statuses; I already identified several “Complete” orders on this page (Jan–Mar 2023). To complete the one‑year window, I need to include late 2022 orders. The pagination control shows a “Page 3” link (bid 1502), which should list older orders (Oct–Dec 2022). The prior attempt to click Page 2 link (1498) timed out and is unnecessary since I’m already on Page 2. The next best action is to click the Page 3 link (1502) to view and record “Complete” orders in the late‑2022 range. I will then aggregate counts and totals; if needed, I can continue to Page 4 for Jun–Sep 2022.

- Total “Complete” orders tallied so far: 15. Final total (count and spend) not yet computed because June–September 2022 orders have not been checked.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (“My Orders,” Items 21–30 of 45 total) is directly on the critical path to the goal; it lists Date, Order Total, and Status needed to count “Complete” orders and sum totals.
- Relevant interactive elements (visible and actionable):
  - Orders table “Orders” with per‑row “View Order” links:
    - Row 12/18/22 — link “View Order” id=1379 (enabled).
    - Row 12/14/22 — link “View Order” id=1390 (enabled).
    - Row 12/12/22 — link “View Order” id=1401 (enabled).
    - Similar “View Order” links exist for each row in the Action column.
  - Pagination is present (“Items 21 to 30 of 45 total”; “Show 10 per page”), enabling navigation to older orders likely covering June–September 2022 (still within the 6/12/2022–6/12/2023 window).
- No errors or off-track navigation detected. To complete the task, remaining pages with older 2022 orders (down to 6/12/2022) must be reviewed and included in the count/sum.

The user wants the number of fulfilled orders and the total spent over the past year as of 6/12/2023. On this Magento site, “fulfilled” corresponds to orders with status “Complete.” The past-year window is 6/12/2022–6/12/2023.

I navigated the My Orders pages:
- Page 2 (early 2023): Found 6 Complete orders with totals: $65.32, $17.99, $762.18, $185.32, $440.64, $132.24. Sum = $1,603.69.
- Page 3 (late 2022): Found 9 Complete orders: $97.15, $20.49, $53.29, $32.47, $218.17, $133.07, $51.94, $845.07, $345.84. Sum = $1,797.49.
- Page 4 (Jun–Oct 2022 plus some outside range): Within range and Complete: $18.99 (10/3/22), $2,890.53 (9/29/22), $133.85 (9/1/22), $38.99 (8/10/22), $36.99 (8/4/22), $40.16 (7/8/22). Excluded: 6/30/22 (Canceled), 7/25/22 (Canceled), 8/12/22 (Canceled), 5/22/22 (Complete but before 6/12/22). Sum for Page 4 included totals = $3,159.51.

Page 1 had no Complete orders in the window. Page 5 would be older than 5/22/22, so outside the window, not needed.

Counts: 6 (Page 2) + 9 (Page 3) + 6 (Page 4) = 21 fulfilled orders.
Total spent: $1,603.69 + $1,797.49 + $3,159.51 = $6,560.69.

Per the messaging tips, when reporting spend, return just the decimal for the amount, and provide a complete, concise answer including the count.

The user wants the number of fulfilled orders and the total spent over the past year as of 6/12/2023. On this Magento site, “fulfilled” corresponds to orders with status “Complete.” The past-year window is 6/12/2022–6/12/2023.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to “My Orders” and reviewed the orders table across Pages 2, 3, and 4.
- Counted and summed “Complete” (fulfilled) orders from Jan–Dec 2022 and early 2023 visible on Pages 2–4; a preliminary total of 21 fulfilled orders and $6,560.69 was reported to the user.
- Orders dated 6/12/22–6/24/22 have not been verified yet (likely on Page 5).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (“My Orders” → Orders table; Items 31–40 of 45 total, current page 4) is on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Table “Orders” with columns: Order #, Date, Order Total, Status, Action. Rows display statuses including “Complete,” “Canceled,” and “Pending”; totals are visible (enabled, readable).
  - Per-row links “View Order” and “Reorder” (enabled; not required for counting/summing but available).
  - Pagination control with links “1”, “2”, “3”, “4” (current), and “5” (enabled/visible) to access older orders.
- Risk: The user response was sent before confirming whether any additional “Complete” orders exist between 6/12/22 and 6/24/22 (likely on Page 5). Without checking Page 5, the count/total may be incomplete.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the pagination link with visible text “5” (next page) to view Items 41–45 and check for orders dated 6/12/22–6/24/22.
- On Page 5, count rows where Status = “Complete” and add their “Order Total” amounts to the tally; if none exist, confirm the previously reported 21 fulfilled orders and $6,560.69.
