The user wants to compare walking and driving times between AMC Waterfront and Carnegie Mellon University. On the OpenStreetMap homepage, I see the search bar and a link labeled "Find directions between two points" (bid 167). Clicking this should open the routing panel with two input fields and mode options (car/foot). That's the logical first step before entering the start and end locations and selecting transport modes. I will click that link to open the directions interface.

The goal is to compare walking and driving times from AMC Waterfront to Carnegie Mellon University using the OpenStreetMap directions panel. The panel is already open, with the mode set to Car. The next step is to input the origin and destination. To proceed systematically, I will first populate the "From" field with a specific and recognizable place name in Pittsburgh to ensure accurate routing. The "From" textbox has the accessibility node [194]. I'll fill it with "AMC Waterfront 22, Pittsburgh, PA" to make sure OSM locates the correct theater in the Waterfront area near West Homestead. After that, I'll fill the "To" field with "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA", then trigger route calculation, read the driving time, switch to "Foot", and read the walking time for comparison. For now, I'll execute the first step: fill the "From" field.

The objective is to compare walking and driving times between AMC Waterfront and Carnegie Mellon University using the OpenStreetMap directions panel. The panel is open, with mode set to Car and both fields populated. However, earlier a "Search failed" occurred for the "From" location ("AMC Waterfront 22, Pittsburgh, PA"), suggesting the origin wasn't recognized. Pressing Enter in the "To" field didn't yield route results, implying the origin still needs correction. To proceed, I should refine the "From" address to a more precise and recognizable one: "AMC Waterfront 22, Homestead, PA 15120" (the theater is in the Homestead/West Homestead area, ZIP 15120). After this update, I can trigger route calculation and later switch to Foot to get the walking time. The next best single action is to fill the "From" textbox with the more accurate address to resolve the search.

 <think>
The user wants a comparison of walking and driving times from AMC Waterfront to Carnegie Mellon University using the current OpenStreetMap directions panel. The current page shows the directions interface with start and end filled:
- From: AMC Waterfront 22, East Bridge Street, The Waterfront, West Homestead, PA 15120, United States (textbox 194)
- To: Carnegie Mellon University, Zebina Way, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States (textbox 199)

The mode is set to Car, and the route summary table shows Distance 7.8km and Time 0:13, which is the driving time. Earlier in the interaction, I switched to Foot and observed a walking result of Distance 6.8km and Time 1:31, then switched back to Car. The current state reconfirms the driving time (0:13). The user’s request is to compare the times, so the final answer should succinctly present both times and a brief comparison. Following the guidelines, I will provide both times and optionally distances, and a simple difference statement. The next best action is to send the message to the user with the comparison.
