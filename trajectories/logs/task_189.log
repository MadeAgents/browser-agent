The user asks for the total cost of their latest pending order. To find this, I need to access the user's order history. On the current homepage, I see a top banner with a "My Account" link (bid 227) and the user is logged in ("Welcome, Emma Lopez!"). The typical path to view orders on Magento is via My Account, then My Orders. The first step is to click "My Account" to navigate to the account dashboard, where I can then look for "My Orders" and identify the latest order with status "Pending" and retrieve its total cost. I will click the "My Account" link now.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the logged-in My Account dashboard and located the Recent Orders section that lists order totals and statuses.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal. The “Recent Orders” table is visible and shows multiple orders with their Order #, Date, Ship To, Order Total, Status, and Action columns.
- Table: “Recent Orders” [1534] — visible.
- Link: “View All” [1530] — visible, enabled (navigates to full order history for easier identification/sorting).
- In-table actions: “View Order” links (visible text: “View Order”, one per row in the Action column) — visible, enabled.
- Status cells include “Pending” (StaticText elements adjacent to the corresponding rows).
These elements allow identifying the most recent row whose Status = “Pending” and reading its Order Total directly from the table or by opening the order via its “View Order” link for confirmation.

The user wants the total cost of their latest pending order. On the current "My Account" page, there's a "Recent Orders" table listing Order #, Date, Ship To, Order Total, Status, and Action. I need to identify the most recent order with status "Pending" and report its total.

In the table, three rows have status "Pending":
- 000000189 (Date: 5/2/23) Order Total: $754.99
- 000000188 (Date: 5/2/23) Order Total: $2,004.99
- 000000187 (Date: 5/2/23) Order Total: $1,004.99

All have the same date, so the latest would be the highest order number (000000189). Its Order Total is $754.99.

Per the formatting rule for amounts, I should return just the decimal, without a dollar sign.
