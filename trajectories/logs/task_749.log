The user wants to create a new private project named "project_site" using a NodeJS template and then add three members: primer, convexegg, vinta. I'm currently on the GitLab Projects dashboard. The most direct next step is to start the project creation flow by clicking the "New project" link on this page. I can see the "New project" link identified as element [252] in the accessibility tree. Clicking it should navigate to the project creation form where I can select templates, set visibility to private, and name the project. After that, I will proceed to configure the template and visibility, create the project, and then navigate to the Members tab to invite the specified users. For now, the immediate action is to click "New project".

The goal is to create a private project named "project_site" using the NodeJS template and then add members. I’m on the "Create from template" page and the form shows:
- Project name is already set to "project_site" (textbox [754]).
- Project slug is "project_site" (textbox [784]).

I'm on the "Create from template" form with the template set to NodeJS Express, and the project name and slug set to "project_site". The alert indicates the previous creation failed due to name/path duplication within the selected namespace. To keep the desired name and slug, I should change the project namespace to one that likely doesn't have a project with this name. The "Project URL" namespace dropdown is currently expanded, showing several group options like "webagent". Selecting a different namespace (e.g., "webagent") should resolve the duplication. I will click the "webagent" menu item to set it as the namespace. After this, I will proceed to create the project and then add the specified members.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened “Create from template” and selected the “NodeJS Express” template.
- Set “Project name” and “Project slug” to “project_site”.
- Set visibility to Private.
- Attempted to create the project; received duplicate name/path errors.
- Opened the namespace selector and clicked “webagent” (no effective change).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is the correct project creation form and is on the critical path to the goal.
- Error alert indicates conflicts: “Project namespace name has already been taken”, “Name has already been taken”, “Path has already been taken” — the current namespace already has a project named “project_site”.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Template: “NodeJS Express”; “Change template” button (id: 651), visible and enabled.
  - Project name textbox (id: 660) — value “project_site”, required.
  - Project slug textbox (id: 690) — value “project_site”, required.
  - Namespace dropdown button (id: 670, label “webagent”) — hasPopup=menu, expanded=False; needs a different namespace selection.
  - Visibility Level: Private radio (id: 710), checked=true.
  - “Create project” button (id: 734), visible and enabled.
- Members have not been added yet (will be possible after project creation).

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Open the namespace menu by clicking button id=670, then select a different namespace (e.g., “byteblaze” id=1116 or “coding_friends” id=1074).
- Click “Create project” (id=734) to submit with the new namespace.

  - “Preview” link for NodeJS Express (id=313) — visible (not required).
- The template selection needs to be re-engaged to return to the project details form and resolve namespace/path duplication.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the “Use template” label for “NodeJS Express” (id=314) to reopen the project creation form.
- If the label click doesn’t select it, click the radio “Use template” for “NodeJS Express” (id=315). After navigation, adjust the namespace to one without a “project_site” conflict, keep name “project_site”, ensure visibility is Private, then submit.

The user wants a private project named “project_site” using the NodeJS template and then to add members. I’m on the “Create from template” form with:
- Template: NodeJS Express
- Project name: project_site
- Project slug: project_site
- Visibility: Private (checked)
- An error alert indicates previous attempts failed due to duplicate name/path in the selected namespace.
The Project URL namespace selector button is open (expanded=True), showing multiple namespaces under “Groups” and “Users.” To keep the required name without changing it, the best approach is to switch to a different namespace that likely doesn’t already have a project named “project_site.” Among the listed options, “webagent1” seems less likely to have a collision. I will select “webagent1” from the open dropdown. After this, I will click Create project in the next step if needed.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to “New project > Create from template”.
- Selected template: “NodeJS Express”.
- Set “Project name” and “Project slug” to “project_site”.
- Set visibility to Private.
- Changed the Project URL namespace to “webagent1”.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to achieving the goal (creating the project).
- An alert shows earlier submission errors (name/path already taken) from a previous namespace; namespace is now set to “webagent1”, which may resolve the conflict.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Textbox “Project name” (id=660) — value: “project_site”, required, visible.
  - Textbox “Project slug” (id=690) — value: “project_site”, required, visible.
  - Namespace selector button (id=670, label: “webagent1”) — hasPopup menu, currently collapsed.
  - Radio “Private” (id=710) — checked=true.
  - Button “Create project” (id=734) — visible.
- After successful creation, the next phase will be to add members (primer, convexegg, vinta) via the project’s Members page.

The user’s goal is to create a private project named “project_site” using the NodeJS template and then add members. I’m on the “Create from template” form with the following state:
- Template: NodeJS Express (selected).
- Project name: “project_site” (textbox 660).
- Project slug: “project_site” (textbox 690).

- Project URL namespace: currently set to “webagent1” (button 670), which I just selected.

The prior alert shows errors from a previous submission (name/path taken), but that was before switching the namespace. Now that the namespace is set to “webagent1,” the appropriate next step is to try submitting the form again to create the project. If it succeeds, I can proceed to add the specified members; if it fails, I’ll adjust the namespace or slug accordingly. Therefore, I will click the “Create project” button (734).

- Relevant interactive elements in the “Invite members” dialog:
  - Textbox labeled “Username or email address” — focused; currently contains an unrelated value (“992”), should be replaced with valid usernames.
  - Dropdown “Select a role” — currently set to “Guest”.
  - Button “Invite” (id=964) — visible; sends the invitation for the selected user.
  - Button “Cancel” (id=962) — visible.
- Required members to add: primer, convexegg, vinta. None appear in the current members list yet.

The project has been created and I’m on the Members page with the “Invite members” dialog open. To add the requested members, I need to use the “Username or email address” field to search and select each user one by one. The textbox [932] is already focused but contains an irrelevant value (“992”). The next best step is to type the first username, “primer,” to trigger the search suggestions so I can select and invite them, then repeat for “convexegg” and “vinta.” I will start by entering “primer” into the field.
