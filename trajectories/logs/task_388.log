The user wants to know who gave 1 or 2 stars for phone cases from EYZUTAK. I need to navigate to the Cell Phones & Accessories category, then to phone cases, find EYZUTAK products, and then look at their reviews to identify reviewers who rated 1 or 2 stars. The page shows a top navigation menu with a "Cell Phones & Accessories" item that has a popup (submenu). According to the tips, I should use hover to reveal nested menus rather than scrolling.

The goal is to identify reviewers who gave 1 or 2 stars for phone cases from the brand EYZUTAK. I have already hovered over "Cell Phones & Accessories" to reveal its submenu. The submenu shows "Cases, Holsters & Sleeves" (bid 1175), which is the relevant category to find phone cases. The next logical step is to click this subcategory to navigate to phone cases listings, where I can apply filters or search for the brand EYZUTAK and then access product pages to read reviews and identify 1- or 2-star reviewers. Using the menu navigation is aligned with the browsing tips and avoids unnecessary scrolling or using the disabled search bar.

The user asks for the names of reviewers who gave 1 or 2 stars for EYZUTAK phone cases. I’m currently on an EYZUTAK product page with the Reviews tab open, and the pagination indicates “You’re currently reading page 2.” On this page, I can see one 2-star (40%) review by “N Randall.” To ensure I capture all low-star reviewers, I need to also check page 1 for any additional 1- or 2-star reviews. The pagination shows a “Page 1” link (bid 2726). The best next step is to click “Page 1” to view those reviews and identify any additional entries before summarizing the names.

The user wants the names of reviewers who gave 1 or 2 stars for EYZUTAK phone cases. I’m on an EYZUTAK product page with the Reviews tab open. The reviews show ratings as percentages where 100% = 5 stars, so 40% = 2 stars and 20% = 1 star. On page 1 of the reviews, I can see two entries with 40% (2 stars): “Evelyn Kurver” and “N Randall.” I paginated to page 2 earlier and did not see any 20% (1-star) entries; the only low-star name encountered was already “N Randall” with 2 stars. Therefore, the correct response is to report these names and note that no 1-star reviewers were found.
