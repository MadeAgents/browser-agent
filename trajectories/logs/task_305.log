The user asks: "How many commits did Philip make in 2023/1?" This implies we need to find the number of commits in January 2023 made by someone named Philip in this GitLab project. The current page is the project overview with repository files shown. To find commit counts by contributor and time period, the best place is within the Repository section, particularly the "Contributors" view which often provides breakdowns over time, or the "Commits" page where we might filter by author and date. The left sidebar shows a "Repository" link; clicking it usually expands or navigates to the repository section where sub-tabs like Commits and Contributors are accessible. Given we cannot scroll and the sidebar has the navigation, the next step is to click "Repository" to access its subpages.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the repository Files view for “The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com” on GitLab, which is on the critical path to find commit information. Relevant interactive elements to proceed:
- link “Commits” ([308]) — visible and enabled; leads to the project’s commit history where author/date filters can be applied.
- link “Contributors” ([317]) — visible and enabled; may show per-author commit counts over time.
- link “Graph” ([320]) — visible and enabled; may provide contribution trends.
- textbox “Search GitLab” ([144]) — visible and empty; site-wide search, less directly useful for the specific commit count.
The current Files page does not show a breakdown by author or month; navigating to “Commits” or “Contributors” is required to answer how many commits Philip made in January 2023.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated from Repository > Files to Repository > Contributors. Currently on the “Commits to main” contributors view for the a11yproject.com project.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to determine the number of commits by a specific contributor in a given month. The screen shows per-contributor charts under the heading “Commits to main,” indicating monthly commit activity.
- Relevant elements:
  - button 'main' ([587]) — branch selector; currently set to “main” (correct for this task).
  - link 'History' ([604]) — available but not necessary for per-contributor monthly counts.
  - Svg chart area ([613]) — displays “Number of commits” with monthly axes; per-contributor panels appear in the screenshot, likely requiring scrolling to locate the contributor named “Philip.”
  - Sidebar link 'Commits' ([301]) — fallback path if precise counts aren’t readable here (can filter by author/date on the commits list).
- Next needed action context: locate the contributor card whose name includes “Philip” and read the bar/value for January 2023 (2023/1). If the exact count isn’t visible on the chart, hovering the January 2023 bar typically reveals a tooltip with the numeric value. The page appears long; scrolling will likely be required.

Task: Determine how many commits Philip made in 2023/1 (January 2023) for The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com.

Current page: Contributors page with per-author sparkline charts over years (2014–2023). I can see an entry for “Philip Wong” with 2 total commits and an SVG chart (bid 1954). The monthly bar values likely show tooltips on hover. However, hovering a generic SvgRoot may not target January 2023 specifically, and I can’t specify coordinates. Alternatively, getting a precise month count via the commits list with filters (author + date range) is more reliable.

Plan: Navigate to the commit history where filtering by author/date may be available. The page has a “History” link (bid 604) near the top. Clicking it should take me to the commits list for the main branch. From there, I can look for an author filter (search or dropdown) and a date filter to restrict to January 2023, then count results. This is preferable to trying to interpret the small chart.

Next action: Click the “History” link to go to the commits list.

✅ Current Progress: On the project’s Repository > Commits page for branch “main.” No author filter has been applied yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly relevant to counting commits by a specific author in January 2023.
- Relevant elements:
  - Button “main” (id: 588): Branch selector; currently set to “main,” enabled/visible.
  - Button “Author” (id: 800): Author filter; hasPopup=menu, expanded=False (collapsed), enabled/visible.
  - Searchbox “Search by message” (id: 842): Empty, enabled/visible (not useful for author filtering).
  - Commits list (id: 847): Visible, grouped by date (e.g., “14 Mar, 2023 — 2 commits”). January 2023 entries should be reachable by scrolling.
- Note: The agent prematurely produced an answer without filtering by author or verifying January 2023 entries.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button with id=800 labeled “Author” and select the author named “Philip” (e.g., “Philip Wong”) from the dropdown to filter commits by that author.
- After filtering, scroll the commits list (id=847) down to the January 2023 sections and sum the per-day “X commits” counts shown for each January 2023 date. If no January 2023 entries appear, the verified count is 0.
