The user's goal is to check if the Social Security Administration in Pittsburgh can be reached within one hour by car from Carnegie Mellon University, using the current OpenStreetMap page. On OSM, the best way to find travel times is via the directions tool. The interface has a "Find directions between two points" button identified as [167]. According to the provided task tips, I should use the two-arrow directions button, then input the starting location and destination, and finally use the 'press' button to compute the route. 

Given the current page shows the search textbox [162] and the directions link [167], the logical next step is to click the directions link to open the directions panel where I can fill the "From" and "To" fields (start: Carnegie Mellon University, destination: Social Security Administration Pittsburgh, PA). Therefore, I will click the directions button now.

The goal is to check if the Social Security Administration in Pittsburgh can be reached within one hour by car from Carnegie Mellon University using the OpenStreetMap directions tool. The directions panel is already open with "Car" selected and two textboxes labeled "From" [194] and "To" [199] available. The next logical step is to set the origin. I will populate the "From" field with "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" to ensure the geocoder selects the correct campus in Pittsburgh. After that, I will fill the "To" field with the SSA in Pittsburgh and then trigger the route calculation (likely by pressing Enter in the "To" field), and finally read the travel time to determine if it's within one hour.

The task is to determine if the Social Security Administration in Pittsburgh can be reached by car within one hour from Carnegie Mellon University using OpenStreetMap’s directions tool. The directions panel is already open with driving mode selected and the "From" field pre-filled with "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA". The next step is to specify the destination in the "To" field. I will enter "Social Security Administration, Pittsburgh, PA" into the "To" textbox (element [199]). After that (in subsequent steps), I will trigger the route calculation (likely by pressing Enter) and read the travel time to answer whether it’s within one hour.
