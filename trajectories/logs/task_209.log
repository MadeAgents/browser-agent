The user wants the customer name and email for a specific phone number: 2137418080. In Magento Admin, customer contact details are typically found under CUSTOMERS > All Customers, where each customer record includes name and email, and their address data (including telephone) can be viewed by opening the customer. To proceed, I should navigate to the Customers area first. On the current Dashboard page, there is a top navigation bar with a "CUSTOMERS" link (bid 207). Clicking this should take me to the customers listing or its submenu where I can search or filter for the phone number. Since scrolling is not supported and using search/filter is recommended, the first step is to click CUSTOMERS to reach the All Customers grid where I can then look for a search input or filter by telephone.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the CUSTOMERS menu from the Magento Admin dashboard; the Customers submenu is visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is still on the Dashboard, but the open CUSTOMERS submenu is on the critical path to locate a customer by phone number.
- Relevant elements:
  - Link 'All Customers' (id 214): visible, enabled. This leads to the customer grid where search/filtering by attributes (including phone within addresses) can be performed.
  - Link 'Now Online' (id 217): visible, enabled, but not relevant for searching historical customer contact details.
  - Top search textbox (id 679): visible, empty; appears to be a global admin search, not specific to customer phone filtering.
- Current assessment: On track. Next required step is to navigate to the All Customers grid to search/filter for phone number 2137418080.

The user needs the customer name and email for the phone number 2137418080.
