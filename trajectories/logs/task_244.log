The user asks for the email address of the customer who is the most unhappy with the product "Olivia zip jacket". In Magento, the “most unhappy” likely corresponds to the lowest-rated review for that product. To find this, I should navigate to the reviews section in the admin. The Task Tips indicate that all reviews can be found under MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews. I can then search/filter for the product "Olivia zip jacket", identify the review with the lowest rating, open that review to see the customer info, and from there get the customer’s email. If the review detail does not show the email directly but shows the customer link, I can click the customer to open their profile and get the email.

From the current Dashboard page, I see the left navigation with a "MARKETING" link [226]. The best next action is to click MARKETING to access the marketing menu where "User Content" and "All Reviews" should be available. I won't scroll as instructed; clicking is the right next action.

The task is to find the email address of the customer who is the most unhappy with the "Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket." “Most unhappy” should correspond to the lowest-rated review for that product. On the Reviews grid, I’ve already entered “Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket” into the Product filter textbox (bid 839), but the filter hasn’t been applied yet. The next step is to click the Search button to apply the filter so that the grid shows only reviews for this product. Then I can open the review entries (via Edit) to check their ratings and identify the lowest one, and from the review or linked customer record retrieve the email address. Thus, the immediate action is to click Search (bid 700).
