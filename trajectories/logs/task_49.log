The user wants information about fulfilled orders over the past four months and the total money spent. On this site, prior purchases are accessed via My Account > My Orders per the task tips. I see a "My Account" link in the top banner (accessibility node [227]). The next step is to click "My Account" to reach the account area where I can then navigate to order history (likely "My Orders"). From there, I can filter by date range (past four months from 6/12/2023 → roughly 2/12/2023 to 6/12/2023) and identify fulfilled orders (likely status "Complete") and sum the amounts. First, I need to get to My Account.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the My Account page; the “Recent Orders” table is visible with order totals and statuses. No calculations or date filtering have been performed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal. The “Recent Orders” table (table ‘Recent Orders’, node [1534]) shows multiple entries with columns: Order #, Date, Ship To, Order Total, Status, and Action. One visible row shows Status “Complete” with Order Total $63.32 dated 3/11/23; other visible rows show statuses “Canceled” or “Pending” with totals (e.g., $365.42, $574.99, $2,004.99, $1,049.99). To ensure coverage of the entire past four months (2/12/2023–6/12/2023), the “View All” link (node [1530], enabled/visible) should be used to access full order history. Each row provides “View Order” action links (e.g., nodes [1555], [1561], [1566], [1571], [1600]), which are visible and clickable for detailed order information. The search button (node [384]) is disabled and not relevant.

The user wants the count of fulfilled (i.e., completed) orders and the total spent over the past four months from 6/12/2023, which means the date range is 2/12/2023–6/12/2023. On the current My Account page, I can see a “Recent Orders” table showing 5 orders with statuses and totals. Only one is “Complete” (3/11/23, $65.32). However, to be thorough and ensure I capture all orders within the past four months (in case there are additional orders not shown in the “Recent Orders” snippet), I should navigate to the full order history. The site tips also say to go My Account > My Orders for previous purchases. The left sidebar has a “My Orders” link, which is the best path to see the complete list and possibly filters. I will click “My Orders” to access the full order list and then evaluate statuses and totals within the date range.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “My Orders” page and opened the full Orders table. No calculations or date-range filtering have been performed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal. The Orders table (table “Orders”, node [1474]) lists the required fields: “Order #”, “Date”, “Order Total”, and “Status”. Relevant rows visible include:
- Row [1484]: Order # 000000170, Date 5/17/23, Order Total $365.42 (gridcell [1487]), Status “Canceled” (gridcell [1489]) — not fulfilled.
- Row [1495]: Order # 000000189, Date 5/2/23, Order Total $754.99 (gridcell [1498]), Status “Pending” (gridcell [1500]) — not fulfilled.
- Row [1506]: Order # 000000188, Date 5/2/23, Order Total $2,004.99 (gridcell [1509]), Status “Pending” (gridcell [1511]) — not fulfilled.
Each row also provides “View Order” links (e.g., [1491], [1502], [1513]) for details if needed. The table shows multiple rows dated within the last four months window (2/12/2023–6/12/2023). To complete the task, the agent should identify rows whose Status is “Complete” within this date range and sum their “Order Total” values. Pagination is indicated on the page (Items 1–10 of 37 total), so ensure all orders within the range are considered if they span multiple pages.

The user wants the count of fulfilled orders and the total spent over the past four months from 6/12/2023, which sets the window to 2/12/2023–6/12/2023. On the “My Orders” page, the table shows 10 recent orders with dates, totals, and statuses. I need to identify orders with status “Complete” within the date window and sum their totals.

Reviewing the visible rows:
- 5/17/23: $365.42 — Canceled (exclude)
- 5/2/23: $754.99 — Pending (exclude)
- 5/2/23: $2,004.99 — Pending (exclude)
- 5/2/23: $1,004.99 — Pending (exclude)
- 3/11/23: $65.32 — Complete (include)
- 3/10/23: $17.99 — Complete (include)
- 2/27/23: $762.18 — Complete (include)
- 2/24/23: $231.54 — Canceled (exclude)
- 2/11/23: $174.99 — Canceled and outside window (exclude)
- 2/9/23: $185.32 — Complete but outside window (exclude)

Thus, within 2/12/2023–6/12/2023, there are three “Complete” orders: $65.32, $17.99, and $762.18. Sum = 65.32 + 17.99 + 762.18 = 845.49. Pagination indicates these are the most recent orders; page 1 covers up to 2/9/23, so older pages will be before the window and do not affect results. I will now report the count and the total (just the decimal for the amount).
