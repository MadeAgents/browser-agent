- Link “Create blank project” [241] — visible, enabled. This is the correct option to start an empty repo.
- Link “Create from template” [248] — visible, enabled. Not needed for an empty repo.
- Link “Import project” [255] — visible, enabled. Not needed for a new repo.
- Link “Show command” [263] — visible, enabled. Optional CLI alternative.

Next expected step: click “Create blank project” [241], then on the following form set Project name to “chatgpt_plugin” and ensure no auto-initialization (e.g., README) if the option appears, to keep it empty.
