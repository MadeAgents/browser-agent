The user wants me to create a discussion post about "the effectiveness of online learning" and ask for opinions with the prompt "your opinion". Following the site’s workflow tips, I should first navigate to the Forums section to find a relevant, specialized forum (e.g., education/online learning). From there, I can locate the appropriate forum, then click Submit within that forum to create the post, ensuring the forum is correctly pre-filled. The current page is the home page with a top navigation link labeled "Forums" (bid 42). The best next step is to click "Forums" to access the list and, ideally, use alphabetical sorting to find a relevant forum.

The goal is to create a discussion post asking for opinions on "the effectiveness of online learning." According to the site’s workflow tips, I should first navigate to a relevant, specialized forum. From the current "List of forums" page, there is an "Alphabetical" link [117], and the tips explicitly recommend using Alphabetical to find the forum name efficiently. While a search box is available, it may search submissions broadly; Alphabetical is the recommended route to identify the correct forum. My plan is to click "Alphabetical" to view forums sorted alphabetically, then locate an education-related forum (e.g., "education" or similar), enter that forum, and then use the local Submit within the forum to ensure the correct targeting. The immediate next step is to click the "Alphabetical" link.

The goal is to create a discussion post titled "the effectiveness of online learning" and include the simple prompt "your opinion" in the Body. I’m on the AskReddit submission form, with the forum correctly pre-filled. The Title field [138] already contains the exact required text. According to the task tips, I should leave the URL field empty and put all content in the Body field. The Body textbox [143] is currently empty, so the next step is to fill it with the exact prompt "your opinion". After that, I will click "Create submission" to finalize the post.
