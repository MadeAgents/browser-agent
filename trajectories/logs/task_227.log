The user wants the price range for products from the brand EYZUTAK. To find this, the most efficient approach is to use the site's search functionality rather than browsing categories. The homepage shows a search combobox labeled "Search" (bid 386) and a "Search" button (bid 391) currently disabled. I should first enter the query "EYZUTAK" into the search input, which should enable the search button. After that, I can click the search button to view results and extract the min and max prices. Since only one action is allowed per step, I will start by filling the search input with "EYZUTAK".</think>

The user asks for the price range for products from EYZUTAK. I’m already on the search results page for “EYZUTAK,” which shows there is 1 item listed. The single product displayed has a price of $9.99. Since there is only one product, the minimum and maximum prices are both $9.99, so the price range is $9.99–$9.99. I will communicate this directly to the user using send_msg_to_user.
