The task is to find the closest cafe(s) to CMU Hunt Library. I’m on OpenStreetMap with the search box focused. The best approach is to search for “Hunt Library” at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. Once I locate the library, I can then look at nearby POIs (cafes). The first step is to enter a precise query into the search box to find the correct Hunt Library location in Pittsburgh.

The goal is to find the closest cafe(s) to CMU Hunt Library.

The user asks for the closest cafe(s) to CMU Hunt Library. We're on OpenStreetMap already in the Pittsburgh/CMU area. Prior attempts to search specifically for “Hunt Library, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” returned “No results found,” likely due to Nominatim quirks. A refined, simpler query may help Nominatim find the Hunt Library entry. The best next step is to update the search field with a more general query like “Hunt Library Pittsburgh” and then run the search. Since only one action is allowed per step, I will first fill the search box with “Hunt Library Pittsburgh”. After that, I can click “Go” to locate it, then identify nearby cafés by looking at map POIs or using Query features.

✅ Current Progress: Entered a refined query “Hunt Library Pittsburgh” into the OpenStreetMap search box. No nearby cafés identified yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is relevant and on the critical path to the goal. Current search results show “No results found,” so the library location hasn’t been pinned yet.
- Search input: textbox “Search” (id 162) — value=”Hunt Library Pittsburgh”, focused, visible.
- Action control: button “Go” (id 165) — visible/enabled.
- Results panel: “Search Results” list shows “No results found” (list item id 525).
- Helpful tools for later: “Query features” (id 454), “Zoom In” (id 434), “Zoom Out” (id 436), “Show My Location” (id 439) — all visible/enabled.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the “Go” button (id 165) to run the refined search for “Hunt Library Pittsburgh.”
- If results are still empty, type “Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh” into the “Search” textbox (id 162) and click “Go” (id 165) to center on CMU, then re-search Hunt Library and identify nearby cafés.

The goal is to find the closest cafés to CMU Hunt Library using OpenStreetMap. Direct Nominatim searches for “Hunt Library” returned “No results found,” likely due to naming variations. The Query features tool is active, but accurately clicking Hunt Library on the map is challenging without zooming/panning precisely. A practical approach is to search for a nearby well-known CMU building adjacent to Hunt Library to anchor the map view, then identify nearby cafés. “Wean Hall” is directly adjacent to Hunt Library and is an established OSM entry, so searching for “Wean Hall, Pittsburgh” should center the map near Hunt Library. Once located, I can use Query features to click the library/cafés. The next step is to update the search box with “Wean Hall, Pittsburgh”.

A red marker (bid 562) is near that icon, and the left panel shows a search result for “Wean Hall,” which is adjacent to Hunt Library. To identify nearby cafes effectively, increasing the map zoom level will reveal more POI icons (e.g., cafes typically shown as coffee cup icons) and make it easier to use the Query features tool to click on them. Since scrolling is not supported, using the Zoom In control is the best next step to get more detailed POIs around Hunt Library.

I’m on OpenStreetMap centered around Carnegie Mellon University; the search box currently contains “Hunt Library, Pittsburgh, PA.” The map shows nearby POIs like “La Prima Espresso” and “Rothberg’s Roasters II,” but to ensure I’m precisely at Hunt Library, I should run the search to center the map on Hunt Library itself. The “Go” button (bid 165) will execute the search. Once centered on Hunt Library, I can identify the nearest cafe icons and, if needed, use Query features to confirm names. The immediate next step is to click the Go button to find Hunt Library.

The user wants the closest cafe(s) to CMU Hunt Library. I’m on OpenStreetMap showing a search results panel with a specific entry for “Hunt Library, 4909, Frew Street, … 15213, United States” (bid 573).

The user wants the closest cafe(s) to CMU Hunt Library. The map is centered on Hunt Library and clearly shows a café label “De Fer Coffee & Tea” within the Hunt Library footprint, indicated by a coffee cup icon next to its name. Since it is located inside the library building, it is evidently the closest café (distance effectively 0m). While I could use the Query features tool to fetch detailed metadata, the visible label suffices to answer the question succinctly. I will provide the answer directly.
