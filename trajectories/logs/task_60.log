🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on OpenStreetMap and remains on the critical path, but the current search query did not resolve to a location, so the map is not centered on CMU Posner Hall.

- Map tools available (for later once centered): “Zoom In” [434], “Zoom Out” [436], “Query features” [454].
The current state is off-track because the search did not locate Posner Hall.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Type “Posner Hall, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” into the Search field [162], then click “Go” [165].
- If no result, type “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” into the Search field [162], then click “Go” [165] to center on CMU and inspect nearby restaurants.

The user asks for the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Posner Hall. I need to first locate Posner Hall on the OpenStreetMap page, then inspect nearby POIs for restaurants and determine which ones are closest. The current page shows the CMU campus result and the campus map, but I have not yet isolated Posner Hall. The fastest way is to use the search box to find “Posner Hall” directly rather than panning around.

Previously, a longer query “Posner Hall, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” returned no results, but sometimes simpler queries work better with OSM’s Nominatim. I will try “Posner Hall, Pittsburgh, PA”. The search textbox [162] is present and editable. I will fill it with the new query so I can then click Go and navigate to the exact building. This positions me to then look for restaurant POIs around it and identify the closest ones.

The task is to find the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Posner Hall using the current OpenStreetMap page. To do that, I first need to locate Posner Hall precisely on the map. The search textbox [162] already contains “Posner Hall, Pittsburgh, PA,” but the results shown are for Carnegie Mellon University generally, indicating the new query hasn’t been executed yet. The next logical step is to click the “Go” button [165] to run the search for Posner Hall. Once the map centers on Posner Hall and shows its result, I can then inspect nearby POIs (restaurants) and determine which are closest. Therefore, I will execute the search by clicking the Go button.

The user wants the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Posner Hall. The map is already centered on Posner Hall, and I can see a nearby fork/knife POI labeled “The Exchange” just north-east of Posner Hall along Margaret Morrison Street and Tech Street. To be precise and verify details, I should use the "Query features" tool on OpenStreetMap to click on or near the "The Exchange" icon and retrieve its feature information (name, type), confirming it’s a restaurant/cafe and ensuring it is indeed the closest. The next step is to enable the Query tool by clicking the "Query features" button [?] before clicking the map location. This aligns with the site workflow and helps ensure accuracy.

The task is to find the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Posner Hall. The OpenStreetMap page is already centered on Posner Hall, and I can see a food/restaurant icon labeled “The Exchange” adjacent to Posner Hall. I previously enabled the "Query features" tool (button [454]), which lets me click on the map to retrieve feature info for the clicked location. 

The next step is to click on the map near the "The Exchange" icon so the query tool returns the POI details (name, type). The map itself consists of multiple image tiles in the accessibility tree ([543]–[561]). Clicking one of these tiles near the “The Exchange” label should trigger the query results. I'll choose a tile that likely corresponds to the area around "The Exchange" adjacent to Posner Hall and proceed.

The task is to identify the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Posner Hall. The map is already centered on Posner Hall, and I can see a nearby food POI labeled “The Exchange,” which appears adjacent to the building. To confirm and retrieve a full address from OpenStreetMap, I set the search box to “The Exchange, Pittsburgh, PA.” The next step is to execute this search by clicking the “Go” button so the results panel updates with entries for The Exchange, allowing me to select the one near CMU and read its full address. This will verify it as the closest restaurant and provide the complete information required.

The user wants the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Posner Hall. The current OpenStreetMap view is centered on Posner Hall and shows a nearby food POI labeled "The Exchange" immediately adjacent to Posner Hall along Margaret Morrison Street. The left Search Results panel lists “Restaurant — The Exchange” with a full address including ZIP code: “4980 Margaret Morrison Street, Squirrel Hill North, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15213, United States.” Since this is visibly the nearest restaurant to Posner Hall on the map and the result provides the full address from OpenStreetMap, I can now report the answer. No further clicks are necessary. I will send the address in the required format.
