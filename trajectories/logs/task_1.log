The user asks for the top-1 best-selling brand in Quarter 1 of 2022. To answer, I should use the Magento admin's reporting features. The Dashboard doesn't show brand aggregation; it only lists top products. The Task Tips recommend generating reports using the REPORTS tab and that this site has been operating since 2022, so selecting a date range from Jan 1, 2022 is valid. Therefore, the next step is to open the REPORTS section to look for a report that can show bestsellers or sales aggregated by brand. The REPORTS menu item is visible in the top navigation (element [339]). Clicking it should open the reports submenu or the reports landing page where I can choose the appropriate report (possibly "Products" or a specialized "By Products" or "Bestsellers" where filters may include brand). This is the logical first step.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is on the critical path toward finding the top-1 best-selling brand for Q1 2022. The Reports overlay is visible and provides relevant report links:
- [431] link “Bestsellers” (Products) — visible, enabled.
- [437] link “Ordered” (Products) — visible, enabled.
- [383] link “Orders” (Sales) — visible, enabled.
- [458] link “Advanced Reporting” — visible, enabled.
These options are suitable for identifying sales performance; “Bestsellers” and “Advanced Reporting” are likely most relevant for aggregating results with date-range filters for Jan 1–Mar 31, 2022.

The user asks: “What is the top-1 best-selling brand in Quarter 1 2022”. In Magento Admin, this likely requires using the Reports section to constrain the date range to Q1 2022 (Jan 1, 2022 – Mar 31, 2022) and then analyzing bestsellers. The direct Reports overlay is open, showing various report links. The most relevant entry points are under Reports > Products, such as “Bestsellers” or “Ordered”. These typically list products by quantity/sales in a date range, though they may not directly show “brand”. However, the first step is to open the Bestsellers report where date filters are available; once on that page, I can set the date range to Q1 2022 and see results. If brand is not directly visible, I may need to cross-reference product brand or switch to Advanced Reporting afterward. For now, proceed by clicking “Bestsellers” under Products to get into a date-filterable report.

The user asks for the top-1 best-selling brand in Q1 2022. I’m currently on the Bestsellers Report page with the date range already set to Jan 1–Mar 31, 2022, and the table shows daily bestsellers without a brand column. To determine the best-selling brand, I need a report that aggregates product orders over the date range, which can then be used to infer brand totals. The “Ordered” report under Reports > Products typically aggregates quantities per product for a given period, making it more suitable than the daily Bestsellers list. The Reports overlay is visible and shows a link to “Ordered.” The next step is to navigate to the Ordered report to view aggregated data for Q1 2022; once there, I can set the date range and run the report to analyze products and derive the top brand.

Scanning the ordered items within the period shows multiple entries for Sprite products (Sprite Stasis Ball 55/75 cm in various colors and Sprite Yoga Strap 6/8 foot) occurring more frequently than other lines like Dash, Marco, Radiant, Quest, Cassia, or Helios.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button [746] “Export” (with [743] set to CSV) to download Q1 results, then aggregate ordered quantities by brand offline to identify the true top-1 brand.
- Optionally, before exporting, set Show By [733] to “Month” [735] and click “Refresh” [737] to condense rows for a cleaner export.
