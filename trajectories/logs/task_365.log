The user wants the walking distance between Carnegie Music Hall and UPMC Shadyside. On OpenStreetMap, the best way is to use the directions tool (the two-arrows icon/link labeled “Find directions between two points”) to get a route and distance, and then select the walking mode.

The current page shows the main OSM map with the search field and a link labeled “Find directions between two points” (bid 167). The next logical step is to open the directions panel. After that, I will enter the two locations (ensuring they are in Pittsburgh, PA), switch to walking mode if not already selected, and read the distance. For now, I will click the directions link to open the panel.

The goal is to measure the walking distance between Carnegie Music Hall and UPMC Shadyside using the OpenStreetMap directions tool. The directions panel is already open with the mode currently set to Car. To ensure the route is computed for walking, I should switch the travel mode to Foot before entering the locations. The accessibility tree shows the radio option for Foot with a corresponding label [180], which is safe to click to change the mode.
