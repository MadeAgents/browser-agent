The user wants the order number of their most recent complete order. Based on the website tips, I should navigate through My Account > My Orders to find order details. On the current homepage, there is a "My Account" link in the banner area with accessibility ID [227]. The first step is to click "My Account" to access account options, then proceed to "My Orders" on the next page. I'll start by clicking "My Account".

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the My Account page and located the Recent Orders table. Identified the most recent order with status “Complete” and extracted its order number: 00000186. ✅ Task completed.

- Table “Recent Orders” (id: 1534) — visible.
- Link “View All” (id: 1530) — visible.
- In the table, the row with Status “Complete” (marker id: 1589) shows Date “3/11/23”, Order Total “$63.32”, and Order # “00000186”.
- Action links for that row (“View Order” id: 1600, “Reorder” id: 1601) — visible.

The user needs the order number of their most recent complete order. On the My Account page, there is a "Recent Orders" table listing order number, date, ship to, total, status, and action. I reviewed the rows and found only one with status "Complete": Order # 000000180, dated 3/11/23. Other orders have status "Canceled" or "Pending," which do not meet the "complete" criteria. Since the task is to provide the order number, the appropriate next step is to send the order number to the user directly using send_msg_to_user.
