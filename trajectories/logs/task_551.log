The user wants to add new size options (30 and 31) to all color variants of the "Diana Tights" configurable product. To accomplish this, I should navigate to the product via CATALOG > Products, search for "Diana Tights," and use "Edit Configurations" to add new size variants for each color. If the size values 30 and 31 are not available, I may need to add them via STORES > Attributes > Product under the Size attribute (using "Add Swatch") and then return to the product to create configurations.

Other visible elements (e.g., “All Store Views” button [708], “Reload Data” [726]) are not directly relevant to adding sizes to a product. To proceed toward the goal, the “Products” link [201] is the appropriate next interaction to locate and edit “Diana Tights.”

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to Catalog > Products. No edits to “Diana Tights” yet; current keyword filter is set to “Nona Fitness Tank.”

🔍 Current State Analysis: The Products list page is on the critical path toward the goal. However, the active filter targets the wrong product.
- Active filter: “Keyword: Nona Fitness Tank” [907]-[908] with a remove button [911]; results show “16 records found.”
- Search input: textbox “Search by keyword” [1397], currently filled with “Nona Fitness Tank,” visible and editable.
- Search trigger: button “Search” [1398], visible and enabled.
- Filter control: button “Clear all” [914], visible and enabled.
- Products grid: table [1743], listing results unrelated to “Diana Tights.”

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button “Clear all” [914] to remove the incorrect keyword filter.
- Type “Diana Tights” into textbox “Search by keyword” [1397], then click button “Search” [1398] to locate the target product.

The goal is to add sizes 30 and 31 to all color variants of the “Diana Tights” configurable product. I’m in the “Create Product Configurations” wizard at Step 2: Attribute Values. The Size section shows existing selected values 28 and 29, while 30 and 31 are currently unchecked. The Color section shows Black, Blue, and Orange as selected (others are unchecked). To fulfill the goal without removing existing options, I should select size 30 and 31 while keeping current selections intact, then proceed through the wizard to generate the new combinations. The immediate next step is to check the checkbox for size “30.”
