The user wants me to create a post in the "science" forum that promotes the GitHub repository "lahwaacz/arch-wiki-docs", and use the description from the repo itself in the body. To do this properly, I need the exact description text from the repository page. On the current page (Postmill home), I can click "Submit" to start a post, but I don't yet have the repo description to paste into the Body field. The homepage guidance suggests using the homepage to visit other sites; I should open a new tab to fetch the repo description before proceeding to the submission form. The immediate next best action is to open a new tab, after which I will navigate to either the homepage or directly to the GitHub repo to retrieve the description verbatim. I will start with opening a new tab.

✅ Current Progress: A new browser tab has been opened. No promotion actions performed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page appears blank (axtree shows only RootWebArea, focused) and is not on the critical path toward promoting the repository to r/science. There are no visible or interactive elements (inputs, buttons, links) available on this page to proceed. To achieve the goal, the agent will need to navigate to the GitHub repository to capture its description, then to the r/science submission interface on Reddit.

➡️ Next-step Guidance: Page content is unrelated to the goal. Consider navigating directly to the GitHub repository to obtain the description, then proceed to Reddit’s r/science submission page.

The user wants me to create a post in the "science" forum using the exact description from the GitHub repository "lahwaacz/arch-wiki-docs". To ensure I have the precise text, I should first navigate to the GitHub repo to read/copy its description. The active tab is currently blank (about:blank), which is suitable for navigating directly to the repository page. Once I retrieve the description, I will return to the Postmill site (Tab 0) and create a submission in the science forum, placing the text in the Body field and leaving the URL field empty per the Reddit task tips. The immediate next step is to navigate to the GitHub repository URL to obtain the description.
