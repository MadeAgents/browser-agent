The user wants to increase the product’s price by $11.5. On this Magento Admin product edit page, the current Price field shows 18.00 in the “[global] Price * $” textbox (node [985]). Per the task tips, any arithmetic must be done using the calculate() function. So first, I will compute the new price as 18.00 + 11.5 using calculate. After I have the result (expected 29.5), my next step will be to fill the Price textbox with the computed value (formatted to two decimals, 29.50) and then save the product.

✅ Current Progress: Calculated the new price: 18.00 + 11.5 = 29.50. No changes have been entered or saved yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the Magento Admin product edit screen for “Cassius Sparring Tank-M-Blue,” which is the correct place to update the price. Key elements to use:
- Textbox “[global] Price * $” (marker [985]): currently filled with “18.00”; visible and ready for editing.
- Button “Save” (marker [876]): visible; used to commit the change.
- Button “Advanced Pricing” (marker [990]): visible; not required for a simple base price update.
- Button “All Store Views” (marker [858], hasPopup=menu): visible; current scope displayed, not necessary to change for updating the global price.

No deviations detected; the agent is on the critical path to achieving the goal.

The goal is to increase the product’s price by $11.5. I already computed the new price using the required calculate() function: 18.00 + 11.5 = 29.50. Now I need to update the “[global] Price * $” textbox (element [985]) from 18.00 to 29.50. The scope is “All Store Views” and Price is a global field, so editing this field should be sufficient. After updating the field, I will click Save in a subsequent step to commit the change. For now, I will fill the price textbox with “29.50”.
