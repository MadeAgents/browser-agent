The user wants to browse products in the Woman clothing category. The page shows a vertical main navigation with multiple top-level categories, each marked as a menuitem with hasPopup='menu', meaning hovering should reveal subcategories. According to the shopping/browsing tip, I should navigate via the dropdown menus using hover. The relevant top-level category is "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry" with element id [656]. The correct next step is to hover over this item to open its submenu so I can then select the Women/Women's Clothing option on the next step.

✅ Current Progress: Hovered the “Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry” category to reveal its submenu, moving toward the Women’s clothing section.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the correct navigation path to reach the Women clothing category. The left navigation shows:
- menuitem id=656 “Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry” (visible, active/hovered, hasPopup=menu) — submenu is displayed.
- submenu id=659 (menu, vertical) containing:
  - menuitem id=675 “Women” (visible, enabled, hasPopup=menu) — primary target to proceed into Women’s category.
  - Related siblings: id=661 “Men”, id=692 “Novelty & More”, id=700 “Sport Specific Clothing” (visible, enabled) — not directly needed for the goal.
Other elements (e.g., Search combobox id=386, disabled Search button id=391) are not necessary for this task. The main content currently shows generic “Product Showcases,” not specific to Women’s clothing.

The user wants to browse products in the Woman clothing category. The site uses nested dropdown menus for category navigation, and we already hovered "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry" (id=656), which exposed a submenu containing "Women" (id=675) that itself hasPopup='menu', indicating further subcategories under Women. Following the browsing tip to use hover for nested menus, the next logical step is to hover over "Women" to reveal its subcategory options (likely including "Clothing"), after which we can click the appropriate Women clothing subcategory. Therefore, I will hover the "Women" menu item to open its submenu.
