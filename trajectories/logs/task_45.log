The user's goal is to check out the most recent open issues for this project. We are currently on the project repository page for "a11yproject.com" within GitLab. To view issues for this specific project, we should navigate to the project-level "Issues" section rather than the global Issues. In the left "Project navigation" sidebar, there is a link labeled "Issues" with the count "42" (bid 332). Clicking this will take us to the project's issues list, where we can then review and, if needed, sort/filter to the most recent open issues. The immediate next step is to click that Issues link.

The user wants to check out the most recent open issues. I’m already on the project’s Issues page with the Open tab selected. The list appears sorted by “Updated date” in descending order, which means the newest activity is at the top. The top entries show:
- “404 for many URLs” (Issue #1535) created 20 hours ago, updated 20 hours ago.
- “401 bad gateway” (Issue #1534) created 1 day ago, updated 1 day ago.
These are the most recent open issues based on updated date. I will summarize these for the user, mention that the list is sorted by Updated date (Descending), and offer to open any issue for details.
