The user wants the highest-rated product within the Meat Substitutes category priced between 100 and 200. I’m already on the Meat Substitutes category page. To efficiently narrow down to items in the specified budget, I should use the left sidebar “Shopping Options” price filter rather than manually scanning products.

The goal is to complete the purchase of the highest rated meat substitute within the $100–$200 budget. We have already added “Beyond Meat Beef Beefy Crumble, 5 Pound -- 2 per case.” priced at $108.27 to the cart, which fits the budget and was the highest rated among the filtered items. We are on the Checkout page at the Shipping step. The Shipping Address is selected and the “Fixed Flat Rate” shipping method ($5.00) is already checked. To proceed with the checkout flow and finalize the purchase, the next logical step is to move to the Review & Payments section by clicking the “Next” button. This avoids repeating previous actions and continues the process toward placing the order.
