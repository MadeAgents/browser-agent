The user wants the customer name and email for the phone number 2065555555. From the Magento Admin dashboard, the most direct way to locate a customer by phone is via the Customers section. The top navigation includes a "CUSTOMERS" link, which typically leads to the All Customers grid where filters/search can be applied (often including phone via address details). I will click the CUSTOMERS menu to navigate to that area and then use filters or search within the customers list to find the record with the specified phone number.

The user needs the customer name and email associated with the phone number 2065555555. From the Dashboard, the left navigation shows the CUSTOMERS menu expanded with options including "All Customers". The best path is to access the customer grid where filters can be applied—often there's a Phone column/filter available or a way to add it. Therefore, I should click "All Customers" to open the list and then apply a filter on the phone number. This is consistent with the site tips advising to use search/filter rather than scrolling. The "All Customers" link is visible in the Customers flyout (bid 214). I will click it as the next step.
