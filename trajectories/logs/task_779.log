The user wants to reduce the price of yellow shirts from Gwyn Endurance for all sizes below L by 15%. To do this in Magento, I need to locate the product(s) under Catalog > Products, then filter to the Gwyn Endurance shirts and specifically the yellow color variants in sizes XS, S, and M (below L). From there, I can edit the associated simple products (configurable children) to adjust prices or use "Edit Configurations" to set price adjustments.

The current page is the Magento Admin Dashboard. The top navigation contains a "CATALOG" link (bid 189). The first step is to navigate to the products listing. I should click the CATALOG link to reach the Products page where we can search and filter. I will perform that single click action now.

The goal is to reduce the price of yellow variants for sizes below L (XS, S, M) by 15% for the “Gwyn Endurance Tee.” We’re on the configurable product edit page, and the “Current Variations” table lists all associated simple products, with a “Select” button per row to access actions like Edit. Since price cells show static text, we must edit each child product individually via its “Select” menu.

Target rows:
- Gwyn Endurance Tee-XS-Yellow (WS01-XS-Yellow) — “Select” button [2045]
- Gwyn Endurance Tee-S-Yellow (WS01-S-Yellow) — “Select” button [2258]
- Gwyn Endurance Tee-M-Yellow (WS01-M-Yellow) — “Select” button [2471]

First step: open the actions for the XS-Yellow row by clicking its “Select” button [2045]. From there, we will choose Edit in the following step and adjust the price to 24 * 0.85 = 20.40 per Tip 12 using calculate().

The goal is to discount all yellow variants of the Gwyn Endurance Tee for sizes below L (XS, S, M) by 15%. I’m currently on the child product edit page for “Gwyn Endurance Tee-XS-Yellow.” I already calculated the discounted price (24.00 * 0.85 = 20.40) using the required calculate() function and updated the Price field to 20.40. To ensure this change is persisted, the next step is to save this product. The Save button is visible on this page (element [888]). After saving, I can return to the configurable product view and repeat the process for S-Yellow and M-Yellow. Therefore, I will click the Save button now.

The goal is to discount all yellow Gwyn Endurance shirts in sizes below L (XS, S, M) by 15%. I already updated the XS-Yellow variant and saved it. I’m currently on the child product page for “Gwyn Endurance Tee-S-Yellow,” where I have filled the Price field to 20.40 after computing 24.00 * 0.85 via calculate(). To persist this change, I need to click the Save button visible on this page (element [888]). Once saved, I will navigate back to edit the M-Yellow variant similarly.

The objective is to apply a 15% discount to all yellow variants of the Gwyn Endurance Tee for sizes below L (XS, S, M). I have already updated and saved XS-Yellow and S-Yellow to 20.40, with a success banner confirming the S-Yellow save. The remaining variant to update is M-Yellow. From the current child product page (“Gwyn Endurance Tee-S-Yellow”), the most direct way to reach the M-Yellow variant is to navigate back to the product listing/configurable product page where the variations grid is available.
