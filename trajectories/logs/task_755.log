✅ Current Progress: Reached the “Create new project” page in GitLab with options to create a blank project, create from a template, or import a project. No project has been created yet; name, template, and privacy settings are not set.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal of creating a private HTML repository named “web_agent_index” using a template.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link “Create from template” (node [248]) — visible/enabled; this is the appropriate path to select an HTML-related template.
  - Link “Create blank project” (node [241]) — visible/enabled; not ideal for the goal since a template is requested.
  - Link “Import project” (node [255]) — visible/enabled; not relevant to creating from a template.
  - Optional link “Show command” (node [263]) — not needed for UI-driven creation.

The goal is to create a private repository named "web_agent_index" using the appropriate template to speed up development. On the current "Create new project" page, the relevant option is "Create from template," which should present available project templates (including one suitable for HTML). From the accessibility tree and screenshot, the clickable link for this option is element [248]. Clicking it should take us to the template selection flow where we can choose an HTML-related template, set the project name to "web_agent_index," and configure visibility to private.

    - Pages/Gatsby — radio/button labeled “Use template” (nodes [482]–[483]).
    - NodeJS Express — radio/button labeled “Use template” (nodes [410]–[411]).
    - Other entries follow the same pattern.
  - The HTML‑specific choices visible on this page include:
    - “Pages/Plain HTML” — “Use template” button next to it (visible in the list; enabled).
    - “Netlify/Plain HTML” — “Use template” button next to it (visible in the list; enabled).
- Selecting the correct HTML template (preferably “Pages/Plain HTML” for a simple static site) will lead to a project creation form where the project name and visibility can be set to Private.

The user wants to create a private HTML repository named "web_agent_index" using the correct template. We are on the "Create from template" page in GitLab with many built-in templates listed. The appropriate template for an HTML repo is "Pages/Plain HTML". I previously attempted to click the radio input with bid 531 to select "Use template" for "Pages/Plain HTML", but the click timed out because a span (bid 532) intercepts pointer events. This suggests that the label/span is the clickable element that toggles the radio. Therefore, the best next action is to click the span label (bid 532) for "Use template" associated with "Pages/Plain HTML". After this selection, I expect the flow to advance to a form to set project name and visibility; subsequent steps will fill in "web_agent_index" and set visibility to Private.

The user’s goal is to create a private HTML repository named "web_agent_index" using the correct template. We are on the "Create from template" page with "Pages/Plain HTML" already selected, and the "Project name" and "Project slug" are both set to "web_agent_index". The only remaining requirement is to set the Visibility Level to Private before creating the project. My previous attempt to click the Private radio input (bid 804) failed because the associated label (bid 805) intercepted pointer events. To correctly toggle the radio, I should click the label element (bid 805) instead. After selecting Private, I will proceed to click "Create project" in the next step.

The user wants to create a private HTML repository named "web_agent_index" using the correct template. On the current "Create from template" page, the template "Pages/Plain HTML" is already selected (indicated by the "Change template" button). The Project name and slug are both set to "web_agent_index". The Visibility Level is already set to Private (radio [804] checked). 

Before submitting, the Project URL section shows a button labeled "Pick a group or namespace" ([764]) between the base URL and a trailing slash. This suggests that no namespace is currently selected; if I attempt to create the project now, GitLab may block submission with a validation error requiring a namespace. The next best step is to click the "Pick a group or namespace" button to select the user's personal namespace (likely "byteblaze") from the dropdown. Once selected, I can proceed to create the project.

Therefore, I will open the namespace picker by clicking the button [764].
