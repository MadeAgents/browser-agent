The user wants me to go to the merge request they have to review, check if the author responded at the end, and post a reply accordingly. From the current GitLab dashboard, the most direct way to find merge requests is the top navigation "Merge requests" link. Using this should show merge requests relevant to me (e.g., assigned to me or needing review). From there, I can locate the specific MR titled "verification functions", open it, check the latest comment at the bottom, and then post "Thank you" if the author responded, otherwise post a simple "@". The first step is to navigate to the Merge requests page via the header link [157].

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the GitLab Projects dashboard, and it is on the critical path toward the goal. The “Merge requests” header item (link [157], expanded=True) is visible and expanded, showing:

Other relevant element:
- Textbox [130] “Search GitLab” — visible, empty.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is relevant to the goal, but the current filter/search returns zero results, so the target merge request is not visible.
- Textbox [114] “Search GitLab” — visible, enabled, empty; suitable for a site-wide search.
- Local textbox [324] — value “verification functions”, visible and editable.
- Button [530] (adjacent to local search) — visible and clickable; function unclear, likely applies/clears local search.
- Tabs [256] “Open 0”, [260] “Merged 0”, [264] “Closed 0”, [268] “All 0” — links visible; all show zero with current filters.
- Heading [587] “Sorry, your filter produced no results” — confirms no items match the current query on this page.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Type “verification functions” into the top-bar input labeled “Search GitLab” [114] and execute the search to locate the merge request across all projects.
- If still needed, clear the local search by emptying the textbox [324] to repopulate the list, then locate and open the relevant merge request.

The goal is to find the merge request about “verification functions” that I need to review, check the latest response, and reply accordingly. I’m on the Merge requests dashboard already filtered to opened MRs with me as the reviewer, but the current search term “verification functions” yields no results—all tabs (Open, Merged, Closed, All) show 0 due to the restrictive search filter.

To broaden the results, the most reliable way is to remove the search query from the page URL and reload the listing with the same reviewer and opened-state filters but without the “search=verification+functions” parameter. This avoids the recent search input that is currently blocking results and should repopulate the list of open review requests assigned to me. From there, I can reapply a local search or locate the MR by title.

I will navigate to the same dashboard URL without the search parameter.

To widen the results and reveal all review requests assigned to me, I should clear the local search term. I previously focused the textbox and performed a select-all; the next step is to delete the text to remove the restrictive search filter. Once cleared, the list should repopulate, and I can locate the target MR.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the Merge requests dashboard and applied a local search for “verification functions” with the “Reviewer = Byte Blaze” filter active. The current query returns no results.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is relevant to the goal, but current filters prevent finding the target merge request.
- Message [587]: “Sorry, your filter produced no results.”
- Filter chip [315] “Reviewer = Byte Blaze” with close control [321]: visible, enabled.

- Global search textbox [114] “Search GitLab”: visible, enabled.
- Tabs [256]/[260]/[264]/[268] (Open/Merged/Closed/All): each shows 0 under current filters.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the close control [321] to remove the “Reviewer = Byte Blaze” filter.
- Type “verification functions” into the global search textbox [114] (“Search GitLab”) and press Enter to locate the merge request, then open it to check the latest author response.

The user wants me to find the merge request about "verification functions" that I need to review, check if the author responded at the end, and reply accordingly.

The URL includes a search parameter "search=verification+functions" which likely enforces a server-side filter causing zero results even after I tried clearing the local textbox.

The task is to find the merge request about “verification functions” that I need to review, check if the author responded at the end, and reply accordingly. The current dashboard URL includes a search parameter (search=verification), and the page shows “Sorry, your filter produced no results,” with all tabs showing 0, indicating the search filter is blocking the list. The most efficient next step is to reload the merge requests dashboard for me as reviewer without the restrictive search parameter so the list repopulates. From there, I can locate the target MR. I will navigate to the same dashboard URL without the search query.

✅ Current Progress: Arrived at the GitLab “Merge requests” dashboard showing open review requests with you as reviewer. The target merge request titled “verification functions” has not been opened. No check of the author’s latest response and no reply have been made yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal.
- Filters:
  - Active chip “Reviewer = Byte Blaze” (element [322], visible/enabled).
  - Tabs: “Open 8” ([256]), “Merged 147” ([260]), “Closed 7” ([264]), “All 162” ([268]) — links visible/enabled.
- Search/filter controls:
  - Local textbox within the listing (element [331]), currently empty, visible/editable.
  - “Recent searches” button (element [278]), visible/enabled.
  - Sort control “Created date” (button [543], visible), and “Sort direction” (link [586], visible).
- List items (each with a clickable title link, visible/enabled) include examples such as:
  - “Draft: Redesign” (link [594])
  - “Improve build time” (link [623])
  - “WIP - Post: Pitfalls of accessible components” (link [652])
- The specific merge request titled “verification functions” is not visible in the currently displayed items; locating it will require using the local search textbox ([331]) or navigating the list.

The goal is to locate the merge request about "verification functions" that I need to review, check whether the author responded at the end, and reply accordingly. I’m on the Merge requests dashboard filtered to “Reviewer = Byte Blaze,” showing open MRs. The specific MR isn’t visible in the current list. There is a local search textbox in the filters area (Accessibility Tree [331] textbox '') which is intended to narrow down the listing. Using this textbox is consistent with the tips about leveraging search bars rather than scrolling. I will input the keyword “verification” into this field to filter the results and reveal the target MR. After that, I will click the search/apply button in the next step if needed, then open the MR and proceed to check the latest author response.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the GitLab “Merge requests” dashboard. Applied filters “Reviewer = Byte Blaze” and a local search term “verification,” but no merge requests are currently listed. The target MR has not been opened, and no reply has been posted.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path but currently blocked by over‑restrictive filters.
- Visible filters:
  - Chip/button “Reviewer = Byte Blaze” (button [323], visible/enabled; removable via close button [329]).
  - Local search textbox with value='verification' (textbox [332], visible/enabled).
- Result state:
  - Message “Sorry, your filter produced no results” (heading [595]); tabs show “Open 0” ([256]), “Merged 0” ([260]), “Closed 0” ([264]), “All 0” ([268]).
- Other controls:
  - “Recent searches” (button [279]).
  - “Created date” filter (button [544], hasPopup='listbox').
  - Possible search/apply button (button [538], visible).
The current filters yield zero results, preventing access to the merge request on verification functions.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Clear the local search to repopulate the list: empty the textbox (element [332]) so the dashboard shows available review requests.
- If still no results, broaden filters by removing the reviewer chip: click the close button on “Reviewer = Byte Blaze” (button [329]) to widen the search, then locate and open the MR.
