- Product Name is already filled with “Swaatch Smart Watch” (id 946).
- SKU is auto-filled as “Swaatch Smart Watch” (id 952); we will keep it unless validation complains later.
- Price (id 963) is filled with 769.99.
- Stock Status (id 997) is “In Stock”.
- Quantity field (id 987) is currently empty and needs to be set to 42.
- The “Attributes” accordion (id 1705) will likely contain Color and Size; we will expand it after setting quantity.

Given only one action per step, the best next step is to fill the Quantity field with “42” to satisfy the stock requirement before moving on to attributes and saving.

The user’s goal is to add a Simple Product with specific attributes: Color = Blue and Size = uni-size. We are already on the "New Product" page and have set the name, price, and quantity. The "Attributes" section is visible, showing:

To progress efficiently, I should change the Color to Blue first. Using select_option is appropriate here because the element appears to be a select/combobox with options listed in the accessibility tree. This avoids the need to first click to expand and then click the option. After setting Color, I will subsequently set Size to "uni-size" and then save the product.

The user’s goal is to add a Simple Product named “Swaatch Smart Watch” with price 769.99, quantity 42 in stock, and attributes Size = “uni-size” and Color = “Blue.” I have already filled out all required fields: name, price, quantity, stock status, and set attributes. When I tried to save, Magento showed an error: “The value specified in the URL Key field would generate a URL that already exists,” indicating a conflict with the auto-generated URL key (swaatch-smart-watch.html). The SEO section is expanded and shows the URL Key textbox (bid 2387). To resolve this, I should input a unique URL key (e.g., “swaatch-smart-watch-2”) in that field, then I can save. The next best action is to fill the URL Key field with a unique value.

The user asked to add a simple product named "Swaatch Smart Watch" with specific details. I navigated through Catalog > Products, used the "Add product of type" dropdown to select Simple Product, and filled in fields: Product Name, Price ($769.99), Quantity (42), and confirmed Stock Status as In Stock. I expanded Attributes and set Color to Blue and Size to uni-size. On saving, Magento reported a duplicate URL Key; I opened the Search Engine Optimization section and set a unique URL Key ("swaatch-smart-watch-2"), then saved again. The current page shows success messages: "You saved the product." and confirmation that the SKU was auto-adjusted to "Swaatch Smart Watch-1".
