Additional rows are present (see screenshot); scan for a row whose Status is “Processing.” Once located, read its “Order Total” value directly from the same row, or click its “View Order” link (each row’s “View Order” is visible/enabled) to confirm. Pagination (“items 1 to 10 of 37 total” with page number links) is visible at the bottom if the needed row isn’t on page 1.

The user wants the total cost of their latest order with status “Processing.” I’m on the “My Orders” page (page 1), and the visible rows show statuses Canceled, Pending, and Complete—none labeled “Processing.” To find any orders marked “Processing,” I should use the pagination controls to check subsequent pages, since filters are not available here. The “Page 2” link (bid 1606) is visible and is the logical next step to continue searching for a “Processing” status. I will click “Page 2” to review the next set of orders.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to the “My Orders” page and paginated between results.
- The total for the latest order with Status = “Processing” has not been captured yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (“My Orders”) is on the critical path to the goal.
- The Orders table [1474] is visible with columns “Order #”, “Date”, “Order Total”, “Status”, “Action”.
- Current visible rows (page shows “Items 11 to 20 of 37 total”) list statuses as “Complete” (e.g., rows with Order #000000148, #000000163, #000000154), so no “Processing” order is currently in view.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - “View Order” links in each row (e.g., [1491], [1502], [1513]) are visible/enabled.
  - Pagination controls at the bottom (links labeled “Page Previous”, “1”, “2”, “Next”) are visible; “2” appears active, indicating we’re on page 2 (older orders).

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the pagination link labeled “Page Previous” (or “1”) to return to page 1 (most recent orders).
- On page 1, locate the row whose Status is “Processing” and read its “Order Total”. If needed, click the “View Order” link in that row to confirm the total.

The user asks: “Tell me the total cost of my latest processing order?” We are on the “My Orders” page (page 1). The table shows several orders with statuses Canceled, Pending, and Complete, but no “Processing.” To find the latest order with status “Processing,” we should continue exploring the order history. Given no filters are visible, the pagination controls at the bottom are the way to navigate. We’ve already viewed page 1 and page 2 previously; page 2 showed only “Complete” statuses. To continue searching for any “Processing” status, the next logical step is to click “Page 3.” This avoids repeating actions that timed out (like clicking “Previous”) and follows the tip to use filters/pagination to narrow results. Once on page 3, we can scan for an order row with the “Processing” status and note its Order Total. Therefore, I will click the “Page 3” link (bid 1610).

The goal is to find the total cost of the user's latest order with status “Processing.” I’m on the “My Orders” page, currently on page 3 as indicated by “You’re currently reading page 3” and “Items 21 to 30 of 37 total.” The visible orders on this page show statuses “Complete” and “Canceled,” with none marked “Processing.” We’ve already checked page 1 and page 2 earlier and didn’t find any “Processing” orders there either.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The “My Orders” page [1460] is on the critical path to the goal.
- Orders table [1474] is visible with Order #, Date, Order Total, Status, and Action columns.

- Being on the oldest page (page 4: Items 31–37) is off-track for finding the latest processing order.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click pagination link “Page 1” [1606] to return to the most recent orders.
- If that fails, click “Previous” [1602] until you reach page 1, then scan for a row with Status = “Processing” and read its “Order Total.”
