The user wants to set all "Aeno capri" as out of stock.

The fastest way is to filter the grid by keyword "Aeon Capri", select all results, and then use Actions > Update Attributes to set Stock Status to Out of Stock for all selected products (including the configurable and all child simples).

To proceed, first I should use the "Search by keyword" textbox to filter down to "Aeon Capri". The search textbox element is present with bid 1392, and a Search button is next to it (bid 1393). I’ll first fill the search term, then in the subsequent step click Search, then select all, and proceed with Actions.

Goal: Make all "Aeon Capri" products out of stock. The Products grid is already filtered to "Aeon Capri" with 7 records: one configurable "Aeon Capri" and six simple variants. To mass-update stock status, the most efficient approach is:
1) Select all 7 items using the header checkbox in the Options column.
2) Use the Actions menu to choose Update Attributes.
3) In the attribute editor, set Stock Status to Out of Stock for the selected products and save.

The user wants all Aeon Capri products marked out of stock. The Products grid is already filtered to "Aeon Capri" and shows 7 records (one configurable plus six simple variants). We need to apply a bulk action to all of them. The most reliable method is to select all rows via their individual checkboxes (since the header select-all checkbox was obstructed by the adjacent "Options" button). Currently, 2 rows are selected (the first two). I will continue selecting the remaining five rows. The next specific step is to select the third row’s checkbox (bid 1861).

The goal is to mark all "Aeon Capri" products as out of stock. We’re already on the Products grid filtered by "Aeon Capri" showing 7 records. Three rows are currently selected (header shows 3 selected), which correspond to the first three rows’ checkboxes we clicked earlier.

The next step to perform a bulk stock status change is to use the Actions menu.

The user’s goal is to mark all “Aeon Capri” products as out of stock. I have already filtered the Products grid to “Aeon Capri” and selected all 7 matching records (1 configurable and 6 simple variants). The “Actions” dropdown is currently open, showing options including “Update attributes,” which is the appropriate bulk-edit tool to change stock status for all selected items at once.
