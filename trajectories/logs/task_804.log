The user wants me to assign the issue regarding "flash alerts" to themself (username: byteblaze) and "primer". I am on the GitLab dashboard.

The "Issues" link is visible in the top nav as element [153]. After clicking it, I will look for a search/filter to find "flash alerts", open the issue, and modify the assignees to include byteblaze and primer.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the global Issues page. No issue has been opened or modified yet; assignees have not been changed.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to locate and open the “flash alerts” issue.
- Search/filter area:
  - Token filter “Assignee = Byte Blaze” (element [318]) is active; its clear/remove control is button inside the token (element [324]), visible and enabled.
  - Query textbox (element [327]) is present and currently empty.
  - Search/submit button (element [513]) is visible and clickable.
- Issue list (element [568]) is visible with multiple issue links (e.g., [574], [599], [624], etc.), but none clearly match “flash alerts” in the current view—likely due to the active assignee filter.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the remove button inside the “Assignee = Byte Blaze” token (button [324]) to clear the restrictive filter.
- Type “flash alerts” into the search textbox (element [327]) and press the search button (element [513]) to locate the target issue.

The user's goal is to assign the issue regarding "flash alerts" to themselves (byteblaze) and to "primer". To do that, I need to locate the specific issue first. I'm currently on the Issues dashboard with a filter token "Assignee = Byte Blaze" active, which likely prevents the "flash alerts" issue from appearing if it's not already assigned to byteblaze. The next efficient step is to remove this restrictive filter token, then use the search box to find "flash alerts". The accessibility tree shows the token "Assignee = Byte Blaze" as element [318], with an internal remove button [324]. Clicking [324] should clear the filter, enabling a broader search.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened the specific issue “Clarify usage of flash alert” (#316).
- Assigned yourself (Byte Blaze) to the issue.
- Opened the Assignee edit interface to add more assignees.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is the correct issue detail view and is on the critical path to complete assignment.
- Relevant interactive elements in the Assignee panel (right sidebar):
  - Textbox “Search users” [1009] — visible, empty, enabled.
  - Option “Primer” [1045] — visible and selectable (not currently assigned).
  - Current assignee “Byte Blaze (Busy) @byteblaze” [1035] — already selected.
  - Option “Unassigned” [1013] — visible; not needed.
- Other elements (e.g., “Close issue” [615], “Issue actions” [618]) are irrelevant to the assignment task.

The user wants the issue assigned to both their user (byteblaze) and to "primer." I’m on the issue detail page “Clarify usage of flash alert (#316).” The sidebar shows the Assignee selector is already open (button "Select assignee" is expanded). The search box “Search users” is focused, and the list of available users includes "Primer @primer" (bid 1453). Since I’ve already assigned myself (Byte Blaze) earlier as shown in the activity feed and the Assignee dropdown is open, the next step is to click "Primer @primer" to add them as a co-assignee. This should complete the goal of assigning the issue to myself and primer.

The goal is to have this issue assigned to both my user (byteblaze) and Primer. The current right sidebar “Assignee” section shows only Primer listed, and the activity feed indicates that when Primer was assigned, byteblaze was unassigned (“assigned to @primer and unassigned @byteblaze”). To try to add myself back alongside Primer, I need to open the Assignee editor. The “Edit” link in the Assignee section (bid 990) should open the assignee picker where I can select/add “Byte Blaze”. Since only one action is allowed per step, the best next action is to click the “Edit” link to open that picker.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened the issue detail page “Clarify usage of flash alert” (#316).
- Assigned yourself (Byte Blaze), then selected “Primer @primer” in the assignee picker, which resulted in Byte Blaze being unassigned.
- Re-opened the Assignee editor.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is the correct issue detail and on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant Assignee controls in the right sidebar:
  - Button “Select assignee” [990] — currently open (assignee picker visible).
  - Textbox “Search users” [1009] — visible, enabled.
  - Option “Primer @primer” [1453] — visible; currently assigned.
  - Option “Byte Blaze (Busy) @byteblaze” — visible in the list; currently unassigned.
- The activity feed shows “assigned to @primer and unassigned @byteblaze,” indicating the project likely enforces a single assignee (selecting one removes the other).

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- In the open assignee picker, click the user option labeled “Byte Blaze (Busy) @byteblaze” to try adding yourself back alongside Primer. If both remain listed, the goal is met.
- If selecting Byte Blaze replaces Primer again (single-assignee behavior), leave a clarifying comment tagging Primer: click the comment textbox (“Write a comment…”, [914]), type a note (e.g., “Project allows only one assignee; looping in @primer here.”), then click the “Comment” button.

The user wants the issue “Clarify usage of flash alert (#316)” assigned to both themselves (byteblaze) and primer. I’m on the issue page and the Assignee selector in the right sidebar is open. The activity feed shows that selecting Primer previously caused byteblaze to be unassigned, which suggests the project may only allow a single assignee. However, before concluding infeasibility, I should try adding byteblaze while Primer is currently selected to see if multiple assignees are supported when using the selector. The Assignee list shows “Byte Blaze (Busy) @byteblaze” as a selectable option (bid 1540). Clicking it may add Byte Blaze alongside Primer if multi-assignee is supported; if it replaces Primer, I’ll know the project enforces single assignee and can follow up accordingly. The best next action is to click the “Byte Blaze (Busy) @byteblaze” option in the open selector.
