The user wants a list of all opened issues that report bugs in the current GitLab project. We’re on the project’s repository page (Primer / design). To find issues, I should navigate to the project’s Issues section using the sidebar. The accessibility tree shows a "Issues" link in the project navigation with bid [326]. Clicking that should bring up the list of issues where I can then filter for bug-related issues (likely via a "Label" filter such as "bug") and ensure only open issues are shown. The first step is to click the Issues link in the project navigation.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the project’s Issues page. The “Open 21” tab is selected, showing the list of open issues. No bug-specific filter has been applied yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is directly relevant to the goal (listing all opened issues that report bugs). Key interactive elements:
- Tab “Open 21” (id [551]) — selected, visible, enabled.
- Tabs “Closed 35” (id [555]) and “All 56” (id [559]) — visible, enabled, not selected.
- Textbox “Search or filter results” (id [613]) — visible, enabled, currently empty; suitable for applying filters (e.g., by label).
- General actions (e.g., “Edit issues” button [587], “New issue” link [589]) — visible but not required for listing/filtering.

No deviation detected; the agent is on track to filter open issues to only those reporting bugs.

The user asks to list all open issues that report bugs. On the Issues page of the project Primer/design, the "Open 21" tab is already selected. To isolate issues that report bugs, the most reliable approach is to filter by the "type: bug 🐞" label. Instead of typing a query (which may depend on specific token syntax), clicking on an existing "type: bug 🐞" label within one of the visible issues will apply the label filter consistently across the list and keep us on the Open tab. I can see at least two issues with this label: issue #33 has the label element [834], and issue #316 also shows the label [1009]. Clicking the first occurrence (bid 834) should filter the list to show only issues labeled "type: bug 🐞". After the filter is applied, I can read the filtered list and report the titles and issue numbers back to the user. Therefore, the next step is to click the "type: bug 🐞" label on issue #33 to apply the filter.

✅ Current Progress: Applied the “type: bug” label filter on the Issues page while the “Open” tab is selected. The tab now shows “Open 2”, indicating two open bug issues are visible and ready to list.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is directly on the critical path to the goal.
- Tabs:
  - “Open 2” tab (id [552]) — selected, visible, enabled.
  - “Closed 1” (id [556]) and “All 3” (id [560]) — visible, enabled, not selected.
- Active filter: A filter chip for “type: bug” is visible near the filter bar (marker around [618]/[622]), confirming only bug-labeled issues are shown.
- Issue items in tabpanel “Open 2” (visible, each title is a clickable link):
  - “#33 Atlas doesn’t work” — shows the “type: bug” label; visible in the list.
  - “#316 Why usage of that alert?” — shows labels “documentation” and “type: bug”; visible in the list.
No deviation detected; the next logical step is to extract these two open bug issue titles and numbers for the final list.
