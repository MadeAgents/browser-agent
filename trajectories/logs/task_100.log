The user wants the nearest Starbucks to Carnegie Mellon University and the walking distance. On OpenStreetMap, the best approach is:
1) Use the search bar to find “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA”. This will center the map and likely display a place sidebar for CMU.
2) Use the “Find directions between two points” (two arrows) to open routing. Set the start as CMU and the destination as “Starbucks”. Then switch mode to walking if needed. The routing engine should choose the nearest Starbucks when given a generic destination, and it will display the walking distance.
3) To provide the exact address including ZIP code, click the destination Starbucks in the results/endpoint to open its OSM place details and copy the full address.

First step: enter the CMU query in the Search box (bid 162 is focused). Then I will press Go next. I will avoid scrolling and external engines per instructions.

The task is to find the nearest Starbucks to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and report the walking distance. On OpenStreetMap, the workflow is:
1) Search for CMU to center the map and/or open its place info.
2) Use the directions tool to set CMU as the origin and “Starbucks” as the destination, choose walking mode, and read the distance (in meters/kilometers).
3) If needed, click the destination pin/place to retrieve its address for context.

Currently, the search box [162] is already filled with “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” and focused, but the search has not been executed (the map still shows Hong Kong). The next logical step is to click the “Go” button [165] to run the search. This aligns with the site tips: to search for a location, input the name and click ‘Go’. Once the search results load to CMU, I will open the directions panel and proceed to compute walking distance to the nearest Starbucks.

I will now click the Go button to execute the search.

Clicking [180] should toggle the Foot mode and trigger the route calculation, after which I can read the walking distance and identify the destination Starbucks. Therefore, the next best single action is to click the Foot label [180].

The user asks for the nearest Starbucks to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the walking distance. I’m on OpenStreetMap with the Directions panel open. Current state:
- Mode is Foot (walking) — good.
- From is “Walking to the Sky … Pittsburgh, 15213” which is a landmark on CMU’s campus — fine as a CMU origin.
- To is incorrectly set to a Starbucks in Menomonie, Wisconsin, resulting in a 1343km walking route — clearly wrong.

To correct this, I should refocus the “To” field and constrain the search to Pittsburgh so the router selects a local Starbucks near CMU. Filling “Starbucks, Pittsburgh, PA” should make the directions engine pick a nearby Starbucks address in Pittsburgh (ideally the nearest by routing), and then the distance readout should refresh to a small local distance. After that, I can read the updated “To” field for the specific Starbucks address, and the “Distance” cell for the walking distance to report back.

Therefore, the next best single action is to replace the To field content with “Starbucks, Pittsburgh, PA.”

The user asks: “Where is the nearest Starbucks to Carnegie Mellon, and what is the walking distance to it?” We are on OpenStreetMap’s directions page with walking mode selected. The From field is a CMU landmark (“Walking to the Sky…15213”), which is suitable as the origin. The To field currently targets “Starbucks, Steel Plaza…” downtown, producing a 5.3km walking route—clearly not the nearest.

To correctly identify the nearest Starbucks, I should refine the destination query so the router picks a Starbucks located on or immediately adjacent to CMU’s campus. The best approach within OSM is to set the To field to “Starbucks, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213” so the search is anchored to CMU. After filling, I will press Enter in a subsequent step to trigger recalculation. This should result in a nearby Starbucks (potentially inside the Cohon University Center or along Forbes/Craig) and provide a short walking distance, which I can then report.

I will first update the To field with a CMU-anchored Starbucks query.

The user needs the nearest Starbucks to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the walking distance. We are on OpenStreetMap’s Directions page with walking mode already selected. The current route shows a distance of 5.3km to a Starbucks near Steel Plaza downtown, which is not the nearest to CMU.

To get the nearest, I should refine the “To” field to target a Starbucks close to CMU. A known nearby area is Craig Street in Oakland, adjacent to CMU, which has a Starbucks. Using a more specific query like “Starbucks, Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA” should make the geocoder pick that local store rather than downtown. After filling, I will need to press Enter to recalculate, but since only one action is allowed now, I will first update the “To” field with this refined query. Next step (after this) will be pressing Enter to trigger routing and read the updated distance.

The goal is to find the nearest Starbucks to Carnegie Mellon University and the walking distance. I am on the OpenStreetMap directions page with walking mode selected. The “From” field is set to a CMU landmark (“Walking to the Sky … 15213”), which is a suitable origin. The “To” field currently contains “Starbucks, Craig Street, Pittsburgh, PA,” which is a Starbucks close to CMU, but the directions panel still shows a stale route to a downtown Starbucks (Steel Plaza) with 5.3km distance. This indicates the route has not recalculated after updating the “To” field. On this site, after entering a destination, pressing Enter on the “To” field triggers route recalculation. Therefore, the next step is to press Enter on the “To” textbox to compute the walking route to the Craig Street Starbucks, which should yield the nearest and a short walking distance.

Task: Find the nearest Starbucks to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and report the walking distance using the current OpenStreetMap page.

Current page state:
- We are on OpenStreetMap’s directions interface.
- Mode is set to Foot (walking).
- From: "Walking to the Sky, Forbes Avenue, ... 15213, United States" — a landmark on CMU campus, acceptable as CMU origin.
- To: "Starbucks, 428, South Craig Street, North Oakland, Bellefield, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15213, United States" — this is the Craig Street Starbucks, very near CMU.
- A status element shows “Loading…”, indicating that the route is being recalculated after I entered the Craig Street Starbucks destination.
- The distance field should update shortly to reflect the walking distance; currently the earlier stale route (5.3km to downtown) is shown in the screenshot but the accessibility tree indicates recalculation is in progress.

Plan:
- Allow the route calculation to complete so the “Directions” pane updates with the correct walking distance to the Craig Street Starbucks. Since only one action is allowed per step, perform a benign click on the map area to let the UI update, after which I can read the updated distance and provide the final answer in the next step.

The user asked for the nearest Starbucks to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the walking distance. I’m on OpenStreetMap’s directions page with walking mode selected. The “From” field is set to a CMU on-campus landmark (“Walking to the Sky, Forbes Avenue, … 15213”), which is acceptable as a CMU origin. The “To” field is set to “Starbucks, 428, South Craig Street, … 15213, United States,” which corresponds to the Craig Street Starbucks adjacent to CMU. 

The directions panel shows the computed walking route with Distance: 538m and Time: 0:07. This indicates that from the CMU landmark, the nearest Starbucks is the Craig Street location and the walking distance is 538m. The question requires the location (full address including ZIP) and the walking distance. I will provide the address pulled from the OSM “To” field, formatted with city, state abbreviation, and ZIP, and the walking distance in the requested format (no space before unit).
