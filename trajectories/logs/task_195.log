The user wants the total payment amount of the last 5 pending orders. To retrieve this, I should navigate to the Orders grid under the SALES section, filter by status "Pending," sort by Purchase Date in descending order (as required by tip #11), and then collect the totals of the most recent five entries. From the dashboard, the top navigation bar has a "SALES" link (bid 156). Clicking it should take me to the sales area where I can access Orders. This is the logical first step before applying filters and sorting.

- link 'Orders' [168] — visible and clickable (primary path to pending orders)
- Other links (Invoices [171], Shipments [174], etc.) are visible but not relevant to the goal.
Main content (Reload Data button [714], Advanced Reporting link [723], tabs like Bestsellers) is unrelated to retrieving pending orders.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal. However, the active filter is “Status: Complete,” which is incorrect for retrieving pending orders.
- Relevant elements:
  - button “Filters” [845] — visible/enabled.
  - Active filters list shows “Status: Complete” with remove button [854] and “Clear all” [857] — visible/enabled.
  - textbox “Search by keyword” [840] — visible/empty; button “Search” [841] — visible/enabled.
  - Table columns include “Grand Total (Purchased)” [1398] and “Status” [1400]; rows are present.
  - Sorting: “↓ Purchase Date” [1390] indicates descending order (desired).
  - Pagination shows “153 records found” and per page set to 200 [1099]; navigation buttons disabled ([1128], [1131]), so all results are on one page.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click “Clear all” [857] to remove the “Status: Complete” filter.
- Type “Pending” into textbox “Search by keyword” [840] and click “Search” [841] to filter the grid to pending orders.

  - “Grand Total (Purchased)” column is present in the grid (values to be summed once filtered).

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Change the Status filter to Pending by opening combobox id='notice-LYH8MA5' [972] and selecting option 'Pending' [982], then click the “Search” button [841] to apply.
- Alternatively, click “Clear all” [857], then set Status to 'Pending' [982] and click “Search” [841].

Objective: Get the total payment amount of the last 5 pending orders.

Current state:
- I’m on the Orders grid with an active filter "Status: Complete".
- The filters panel is open. The Status combobox (bid 972) currently shows "Complete".
- To satisfy the task, I must:
  1) Change the Status filter to "Pending".
  2) Apply the filter.
  3) Ensure sorting by Purchase Date is descending (and perform a sort operation at least once).
  4) Read Grand Total (Purchased) for the most recent five pending orders and compute the sum using calculate().

Best next action:
- Change the Status filter from "Complete" to "Pending" directly through the combobox.
- I will use select_option on the Status combobox (bid 972) to set it to "Pending". After that, in subsequent steps I will apply filters and then handle sorting and calculations.

This avoids redundant clicks and aligns with the task flow.

Goal: Get the total payment amount of the last 5 pending orders.

Current page: Orders grid with an active filter "Status: Pending", 10 records found. The column header shows "↓ Purchase Date", which suggests descending order, but per benchmark rule #11, I must perform a sorting operation at least once and ensure the grid is sorted in descending order by Purchase Date before selecting the most recent orders.

Observation: The visible dates appear out of order (April entries come before May), suggesting the sort may not actually be applied despite the arrow indicator. To comply with rule #11 and to ensure the correct ordering, I should click the "Purchase Date" column header to trigger sorting. After this action, I can verify the order and, if necessary, click again to toggle to descending. Once confirmed, I’ll read the "Grand Total (Purchased)" for the top five rows and sum them using the calculate() function.

The task is to get the total payment amount of the last 5 pending orders. I’m on the Orders grid with an active filter “Status: Pending” and 10 records found. The column header currently shows “↑ Purchase Date,” meaning the grid is sorted in ascending order (oldest first). Per rule #11, I must sort by Purchase Date in descending order to ensure the most recent orders are on top, and I must perform a sort action at least once. I already clicked the Purchase Date header once (resulting in ascending), so I need to click it again to toggle to descending. After it’s descending, I will read the top five rows’ “Grand Total (Purchased)” values and then compute their sum using the calculate() function. The immediate next step is to click the Purchase Date column header to switch to descending order.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Sales > Orders grid.
- Set and applied filter: Status = Pending (active filter visible).
- Performed sorting on “Purchase Date” and currently set to descending (↓), ensuring most recent orders appear first.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page is on the critical path for extracting totals from pending orders.
- Relevant elements:
  - Active filters section [846]/[850]: “Status: Pending” item [7410] is present; “Clear all” [857] available.
  - Records/pagination: “10 records found”; “per page” textbox [1099] = 200; pagination buttons [1128] and [1131] disabled, so all needed rows are on the current page.
  - Orders table [1368] with data rows in rowgroup [1408] is visible.
  - Column headers: “↓ Purchase Date” [1390] (descending, most recent first) and “Grand Total (Purchased)” [1398] (target amounts).
- Next action to reach the goal: read the “Grand Total (Purchased)” values from the first five rows in [1368] and compute their sum.

The objective is to get the total payment amount of the last 5 pending orders. I am on the Orders grid filtered by Status: Pending with 10 records found. Per rule #11, I performed sorting by Purchase Date to descending by clicking the column header twice. Now I need to identify the most recent five orders and sum their "Grand Total (Purchased)" values.

From the visible rows and their dates/amounts, the most recent five pending orders (descending by Purchase Date) are:
- 000000299 — May 31, 2023 — $219.40
- 000000065 — May 28, 2023 — $210.00
- 000000308 — Apr 19, 2023 7:42:37 PM — $175.40
- 000000307 — Apr 19, 2023 7:42:25 PM — $101.20
- 000000306 — Apr 19, 2023 7:42:16 PM — $179.40

Next step: compute the sum using the calculate() function, as required for any calculations.

The user asked for the total payment amount of the last 5 pending orders. I am on the Orders grid with the active filter "Status: Pending" and confirmed there are 10 records. Per rule #11, I ensured sorting by Purchase Date in descending order by clicking the "Purchase Date" column header twice, resulting in the most recent orders at the top. I then identified the top five pending orders and captured their "Grand Total (Purchased)" values:
- $219.40 (000000299, May 31, 2023)
- $210.00 (000000065, May 28, 2023)
- $175.40 (000000308, Apr 19, 2023 7:42:37 PM)
- $101.20 (000000307, Apr 19, 2023 7:42:25 PM)
- $179.40 (000000306, Apr 19, 2023 7:42:16 PM)

Following the calculation guideline, I used calculate('219.40 + 210.00 + 175.40 + 101.20 + 179.40') which returned 885.40. The user expects just the decimal for the amount, so I will provide "885.40".
