The user wants the walking distance between Carnegie Mellon University and Carnegie Music Hall. On OpenStreetMap, the best way is to use the directions tool, which allows selecting a travel mode (walking). The interface shows a "Find directions between two points" link (element [167]) near the search bar. Clicking this should open the directions panel where I can enter the two locations and then choose the walking option. The welcome overlay shouldn't block this link. My next step is to open the directions panel by clicking the link.

✅ Current Progress:
- OpenStreetMap Directions panel is open.
- Travel mode set to Foot (walking).
- “From” populated with Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, PA).
- “To” populated with Carnegie Music Hall, 4400 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA.
- Routing was attempted but returned an error.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page is on the critical path for measuring walking distance.
- Current elements and state:
  - Mode radios: Foot [179] checked=true; Car [173] unchecked; Bicycle [176] unchecked.
  - Directions service combobox [182]: value=OSRM; options available — GraphHopper [184], OSRM [185] (selected), Valhalla [186]; enabled, collapsed.
  - From textbox [194]: filled with the CMU address; enabled, visible.
  - To textbox [199]: filled with the Carnegie Music Hall address; enabled, visible, focused.
  - Reverse Directions button [200]: enabled.
- The Directions panel shows: “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” indicating the current engine (OSRM) failed to compute a walking route between these nearby Pittsburgh addresses.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the “Directions services” combobox [182], then select option “GraphHopper” [184] to retry routing with a different engine. If it doesn’t auto-recompute, press Enter in the “To” field [199].

The user wants the walking distance between Carnegie Mellon University and Carnegie Music Hall using OpenStreetMap. The directions panel is open, the travel mode is already set to Foot, and both the From and To fields are correctly filled with the Pittsburgh addresses. However, the page shows “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” This likely indicates an issue with the current routing engine (OSRM) for walking. The directions panel includes a "Directions services" combobox currently set to OSRM, with other options available: GraphHopper and Valhalla. A common workaround on OSM when a route can't be found is to switch the routing engine. The most efficient next action is to change the routing service to GraphHopper, which often succeeds for walking routes in Pittsburgh. Since the combobox appears as a selectable control with listed options, I can use select_option on element [182] to choose "GraphHopper" in a single step. After that, if it doesn't automatically compute, I will press Enter in the To field in a subsequent step.

The user wants the walking distance between Carnegie Mellon University and Carnegie Music Hall. I’m on the OpenStreetMap directions page with:
- Mode set to Foot (radio shows checked=true).
- Directions service set to GraphHopper (combobox value=GraphHopper).
- From and To fields populated with the correct Pittsburgh addresses (both show full OSM-address strings).
The live region shows “Loading...”, but the map appears centered elsewhere and I don’t yet see a displayed distance in the directions panel. To ensure the route computation is triggered (or retriggered) and the summary with distance appears, the reliable next step is to press Enter in the currently focused “To” field [199]. This usually initiates/refreshes the route calculation and then the distance will be shown in the Directions panel, which I can read in the subsequent step.

✅ Current Progress:
- OpenStreetMap Directions panel is open and configured for walking.
- “From” and “To” fields are populated with the correct Pittsburgh addresses (CMU and Carnegie Music Hall).
- Directions service set to GraphHopper and routing was attempted.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is directly relevant to the goal (measuring walking distance between the two places).
- Key elements and state:
  - Mode radio “Foot” [179]: checked=true (enabled, visible).
  - Directions services combobox [182]: value='GraphHopper' (enabled, visible). Other options available: OSRM [185], Valhalla [186].

  - “To” textbox [199]: filled with “Carnegie Music Hall, 4400 Forbes Avenue, … Pittsburgh, PA”, focused (enabled, visible).
  - Directions pane [476] shows error: “Couldn't find a route between those two places.”
- This indicates the current routing engine did not return a walking route; trying another service is the next logical step.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Change routing engine: open combobox “Directions services” [182] and select “Valhalla” [186] (if that fails, try “OSRM” [185]).
- Retrigger routing: with the “To” field [199] focused, press Enter to compute the route and display the walking distance.

The directions panel is open with Foot mode selected, and both “From” (CMU) and “To” (Carnegie Music Hall) fields contain full Pittsburgh addresses. However, the Directions pane shows “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” The current routing engine is GraphHopper. When an engine fails on OSM, switching to another service (Valhalla or OSRM) often resolves it. The combobox for “Directions services” [182] shows options GraphHopper, OSRM, and Valhalla. I will switch to Valhalla to trigger a recalculation; if it doesn’t auto-route, I can press Enter in the To field next. This is the most logical next action to obtain a walking route and distance.
