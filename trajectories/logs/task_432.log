The user wants the product with the lowest per unit price from the open tabs added to the cart. I need to compare the prices on both tabs. The current active tab (Tab 1) shows the V8 +Energy pack of 24 priced at $14.47. To determine which product has the lower per-unit price (likely per can), I should check the price of the Ciclon Energy Drink on Tab 0. The next step is to switch to Tab 0 to see its price so I can compute and compare the per-can cost for both products before adding the correct one to the cart.

✅ Current Progress:
- Focused on the Ciclon Energy Drink product tab and captured key pricing details.
- Identified price ($36.99) and unit count (24 cans); Qty is currently set to 1.
- No item has been added to the cart yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current product page is on the critical path for comparing per-unit prices across open tabs to add the lowest-cost item.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Button “Add to Cart” [1586]: enabled and visible.
  - Spinbutton “Qty” [1584]: value=1, editable.
  - Price text “$36.99”: visible.
  - Cart link “My Cart 4 items” [278]: visible.
- Based on displayed info, the per-unit price here is approximately $36.99 / 24 ≈ $1.54 per can.
- To fulfill the goal, the agent still needs to compare this per-unit price with the product(s) in the other open tab(s) before adding the lowest-cost item to the cart.

The goal is to add the product with the lowest per unit price from the open tabs to the cart. I’m currently on Tab 0 (Ciclon Energy Drink), which shows $36.99 for 24 cans, giving an approximate per-can price of $36.99/24 ≈ $1.54. I need to compare this against the V8 +Energy product in Tab 1. To do that, I should switch to Tab 1 to view its price and pack size (likely also 24 cans), compute the per-unit price there, and then decide which product has the lower per-can cost. The next step is to activate Tab 1 to retrieve its price details.

The task is to add the product with the lowest per unit price from the two open tabs to the cart. I checked both tabs: Ciclon Energy Drink (24 cans) is $36.99, which is about $1.54 per can, while the current tab shows V8 +Energy Pack of 24 at $14.47, which is about $0.60 per can. Therefore, V8 +Energy has the lower per-unit price. On the current page, the “Add to Cart” button is visible and enabled (element [1586]), with quantity set to 1 and the item in stock. To fulfill the goal, I should click “Add to Cart” for this V8 product.
