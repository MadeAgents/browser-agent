The user wants me to submit a merge request for the branch that implements “support of template strings,” targeting the master branch, and assign myself and Roshan as reviewers. I’m currently on the project’s main repository page for a11yproject.com. To find the specific branch, the best route is to go to the Repository section and then Branches (per the provided tips: Repository tab has a Branches menu). From there, I can search or scan for a branch related to “template strings.” Once found, I should use GitLab’s “Create merge request” for that branch, ensuring the target is master (or main if master doesn’t exist). Then, in the MR creation screen, assign reviewers (myself “byteblaze” and “Roshan”).

The left sidebar has a Repository link (id [301]). Clicking it should expose sub-navigation or land me on a repository section where a Branches tab/link is available. That is the logical next step to locate the specific branch. I will click "Repository" in the left navigation.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward creating a merge request. Relevant interactive elements visible and enabled:
- Link “Branches” [315] in the left Project navigation — visible/enabled; needed to locate the branch that implements template strings and start an MR.
- Link “Compare” [324] — visible/enabled; can be used to compare branches and initiate an MR.
- Link “Merge requests” [354] — visible/enabled; for reviewing/creating MRs if the branch MR already exists.
- Branch selector button “main” [621], hasPopup menu, expanded=False — visible/enabled; indicates current file view is on the “main” branch and allows switching branches if needed.
- Global search textbox “Search GitLab” [144] — visible/enabled; could help locate the specific branch if its name is known.

No blockers detected; the current page is appropriate for proceeding to find the branch and create the merge request.

The task is to submit a merge request for the branch that implements support of template strings, targeting the master branch, and assign myself (byteblaze) and Roshan as reviewers. I’m currently on the repository’s Files page for the main branch. The next logical step is to navigate to the Branches page to find the specific branch that mentions template strings. The sidebar under Repository shows a “Branches” link (bid 315). From the Branches page, I can either search or scan for a branch whose name or description suggests “support of template strings,” and then use the “Create merge request” action available per-branch. After initiating the MR, I will ensure the target branch is set to master (or verify whether master exists; if not, consider main as the closest equivalent, but the instruction explicitly says master, so I’ll look for it). Then I’ll add reviewers: myself (Byte Blaze) and Roshan. For now, the best next single action is to click “Branches” to locate the appropriate branch.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This page is on the critical path to create the MR.
- Relevant elements:
  - Source branch selector: button 'feature/replace-gulp' [632] — visible/enabled (correct).
  - Target branch selector: button 'main' [695] — visible/enabled; needs to be changed to “master” to match the goal.
  - Project selectors: 'a11yproject/a11yproject.com' buttons [614] (source) and [677] (target) — visible/enabled, but not required to change.
  - Commit item confirms relevance: link “upgrade node version to allow use of template strings” [660].
  - A “Compare branches and continue” button is visible on the page (proceeds to MR details), where reviewers can be assigned.
- Gaps vs goal: Target branch is incorrect (main vs master). Reviewers (self and Roshan) not yet added; MR not yet created/submitted.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the target branch button labeled 'main' [695] and switch it to 'master'. After updating, proceed with the page’s continue action to move to the MR details screen where reviewers can be assigned.

The user wants to submit a merge request for the branch that implements support of template strings, targeting the master branch, and assign myself and Roshan as reviewers. I'm on the "New merge request" page with:
- Source branch: feature/replace-gulp (confirmed by commit message “upgrade node version to allow use of template strings,” matching the user’s description).
- Target branch: The dropdown is open, currently set to "main". I searched for "master" in the target branch search field (bid 704), and the UI shows “No matching results,” indicating there is no "master" branch in this repository.

Given there is no "master" branch, the correct practical target is "main." This aligns with the provided tips that master/main may be interchangeable depending on the repository. The next step is to proceed to the MR details page where I can assign reviewers. The button “Compare branches and continue” (bid 738) will take me to the full MR form where I can set reviewers (myself/byteblaze and Roshan) and then submit the MR.

Therefore, I should click “Compare branches and continue” to proceed to the MR form.

The goal is to submit a merge request for the branch implementing template string support, target the master branch, and assign myself and Roshan as reviewers. I’m on the “New merge request” page with source “feature/replace-gulp,” which matches the commit “upgrade node version to allow use of template strings.” I already attempted to change the target to “master,” but the dropdown showed no matching results, indicating this repository uses “main” instead of “master,” so proceeding with “main” is appropriate.

To meet the reviewer assignment requirement, I need to open the Reviewer selector and add two reviewers: myself (Byte Blaze) and Roshan. The page shows the Reviewer section with an “Unassigned” button (bid 751). The next step is to click this button to open the reviewer selection dropdown so I can search/select both reviewers. After assigning reviewers, I will click “Create merge request” to submit.

Current state: I’m on the “New merge request” page for source branch feature/replace-gulp into target main. I previously attempted to set target to master via the Change branches control and the branch dropdown search showed no results for "master," indicating this repo uses main (consistent with the tips). Therefore, proceeding with main is the only feasible target.

Reviewer status: Initially, Roshan Jossy was shown as a reviewer. I opened the reviewer selector and selected myself (Byte Blaze) and then ensured Roshan is also selected. This satisfies the requirement to assign myself and Roshan as reviewers.

- Encountered a blocking message indicating an MR for this source branch already exists; no new MR submitted.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- On the critical path but blocked by an error: “Another open merge request already exists for this source branch.”
- Relevant interactive elements (visible/enabled):
  - Source branch selector button: “feature/replace-gulp” [632].
  - Target branch selector button: “main” [695].
  - Primary action: “Compare branches and continue” button [738].
  - Navigation to view existing MRs: left sidebar link “Merge requests” [363].
- Given the error, creating a new MR would be redundant; the appropriate step is to navigate to the existing MR and ensure reviewers are assigned.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the left sidebar link “Merge requests” [363] to open the MR list, then open the existing MR for “feature/replace-gulp” and assign reviewers (Byte Blaze and Roshan) there.

The goal is to submit a merge request for the branch implementing support for template strings and assign myself (byteblaze) and Roshan as reviewers. On the “New merge request” page, the source branch is feature/replace-gulp, which matches the commit message “upgrade node version to allow use of template strings.” However, the page shows an error: “Another open merge request already exists for this source branch: !1141,” which indicates a merge request is already open for this branch. Creating another MR isn’t possible and would be redundant. Therefore, I should navigate to the project’s Merge Requests list, locate the existing MR (likely !1141), open it, and assign reviewers (myself and Roshan). The left sidebar has a “Merge requests” link (bid 363). The next best action is to click that link to access the existing MRs.

✅ Current Progress:
- Identified the correct source branch: “feature/replace-gulp” (commit mentions enabling template strings).
- Confirmed repository has no “master” branch; default target is “main.”
- Attempted to create a new MR but received a blocker: an open MR for this source branch already exists (!1141).
- Navigated to the project’s Merge Requests list to locate and update the existing MR (for assigning reviewers).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is the project’s Merge Requests list, which is on the critical path to open the existing MR and assign reviewers.
- Relevant interactive elements (visible/enabled):
  - Filter tabs: “Open 12” [598], “Merged 816” [602], “Closed 87” [606], “All 915” [610] — links to scope the list.
  - Search/filter input: “Search or filter results...” textbox [655] — empty; can be used to find the MR by branch/title (e.g., “feature/replace-gulp” or “replace gulp”).
  - “New merge request” link [623] — not needed since an MR already exists.
  - Sort control: “Created date” button [875] — optional, not essential for locating the MR.

Objective: Submit a merge request for the branch that implements support of template strings, targeting the master branch, and assign myself (Byte Blaze) and Roshan as reviewers. We discovered during MR creation that an MR already exists for the source branch feature/replace-gulp (error referenced existing MR !1141). Therefore, instead of creating a new MR, we should open the existing MR and set the reviewers accordingly.

Current context: We are on the Merge Requests list for the project. The list shows an MR titled "Remove Gulp in Favor of NPM CLI" with ID !1141, which aligns with the feature/replace-gulp branch (from earlier steps). To proceed, we need to open this MR by clicking its title link. From there, we will adjust reviewers to include myself and Roshan. The repository appears to use main instead of master (no "master" found in branch selector), which fits the provided tip that main/master may be interchangeable. Thus, it's acceptable to proceed with main.

Next step: Click the MR link "Remove Gulp in Favor of NPM CLI" (bid 1426) to open MR !1141, where reviewer assignment can be updated.

- Confirmed an existing merge request already covers this branch: !1141 “Remove Gulp in Favor of NPM CLI.”
- Verified repository has no “master” branch; the MR targets “main.”
- Arrived on the MR details page; reviewers have not been assigned yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is the merge request detail for source “feature/replace-gulp” [681] into target “main” [684], which is on the critical path to assign reviewers and finalize submission.
- Relevant elements:
  - Link “Edit” [625] — visible/enabled; opens the MR edit form to set Reviewers/Assignees.
  - Right sidebar shows “0 Reviewers” (no reviewers assigned); Assignees: None.
  - Status notice “Merge blocked: merge conflicts must be resolved” is present, but it does not prevent assigning reviewers or maintaining the open MR.
- Note: “master” branch does not exist in this repo; targeting “main” fulfills the intent given the repository’s default branch.
