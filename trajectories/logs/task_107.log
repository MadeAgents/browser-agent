The user needs the monthly count of successful orders from May to December 2022 in MM:COUNT format. On Magento Admin, such data is typically found under the REPORTS section, often within Sales or a specific Orders/Order Count report. The Task Tips mention that reports can be generated via REPORTS > "report type" and that there is a 1-of-n selection UI for Order Status in REPORTS > Orders. Also, there is a specific tip about retrieving historical order statistics via the Reports menu and selecting the Order Count page, which suggests an "Order Count" report exists. To proceed, I should navigate to the REPORTS section from the dashboard. The current page shows the top navigation with a "REPORTS" link (bid 339). Clicking that should reveal options or navigate to a reports page where I can choose the appropriate report, set the date range to May 1, 2022 to Dec 31, 2022, select monthly grouping, and filter for successful (likely "Complete") orders. The first step is to click REPORTS to access the reporting options.

The user wants the monthly count of successful orders from May to December 2022 in MM:COUNT format. In Magento, “successful” typically corresponds to orders with a Complete status. The best place to generate monthly counts with status filtering is the Sales > Orders report. The current page shows the Reports overlay with the “Orders” link available (bid 383). I should click the Orders report to access filters like date range, Show By (Month), and Order Status (including the 1-of-n selection UI to choose Complete).

The user needs monthly counts of successful orders from May to December 2022. I'm on the Orders Report page, which has filters for Period, date range, and Order Status.

The user needs monthly counts of successful orders from May to December 2022. I'm on the Orders Report page with:
- Period set to Month.
- From: 05/01/2022, To: 12/31/2022.
- Order Status set to Specified, with a visible multiselect list of statuses.

To interpret “successful,” Magento typically treats “Complete” as successfully fulfilled orders. The listbox shows multiple statuses (Canceled, Closed, Complete, etc.). I should select “Complete” in the status list. The third visible option should correspond to “Complete,” which is element [794]. After selecting it, the next step (in a subsequent action) will be to click “Show Report” to generate the results and then read counts per month. Since I can only perform one action now, I will select the “Complete” status option.

The user needs monthly counts of successful orders (interpreted as “Complete” status) from May to December 2022 in MM:COUNT format. I’m on the Orders Report page with filters configured:

The results table currently shows “0 records found,” which indicates the report hasn’t been executed with the current filters yet.
