The user wants the walking route (walkway) to the closest Target from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh. On the OpenStreetMap site, the best approach is to use the directions feature rather than generic search, as it can interpret "Target" and find the nearest matching destination relative to the starting address. The UI shows a "Find directions between two points" link [167] next to the search bar. Clicking this should open the A-to-B route planning panel where I can input the start and destination, select walking mode, and compute the route. Therefore, the next best single action is to click the directions link to bring up the routing fields.

Goal: Find the walking route (walkway) from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh to the closest Target using the OpenStreetMap directions panel.

Current UI analysis:
- The routing panel is open on the left with mode radio buttons (Car [173] checked by default, Bicycle [176], Foot [179]).
- The "From" textbox [194] and "To" textbox [199] are empty.
- To get walking directions, I need to switch mode to Foot first to ensure the computed route is pedestrian-optimized.
- After setting the mode, I will fill "From" with "401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh, PA" and "To" with "Target" (or "Target, Pittsburgh, PA"). Usually, the OSM directions field will suggest candidates; selecting the relevant one (likely East Liberty Target) should yield the nearest route automatically. But first, set the Foot mode.

Plan:
1) Click the Foot radio [179] to change the routing mode to walking.
2) Then fill "From" with the given address.
3) Fill "To" with "Target" (and select the right result if a list appears).
4) Trigger route calculation (often automatic upon selection or pressing Enter).

Proceed with step 1: click the Foot radio.

The user asks for the walkway to the closest Target from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh. The current OpenStreetMap page already shows walking (Foot) directions computed from “Kenmawr Apartments, 401 Shady Avenue, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA 15206, United States” to “Target, 6231 Penn Avenue, East Liberty, Pittsburgh, PA 15206, United States.” The directions panel shows Distance 891m and Time 0:12, with step-by-step instructions (though labeled as “unnamed road” segments, which is typical for pedestrian paths on OSM). Since the goal is to report the walkway and identify the closest Target, I should provide the destination’s full OSM address including ZIP, confirm the start address, and include the distance and time in the required formats (distance without space, time as 0:12). No further browser interaction is needed; I should send the concise summary to the user.
