The user asks for product names and the sizes of products that have 2-3 units left. This implies we need to find products with low stock (quantity 2 or 3) and capture both the product name and the size attribute. The Magento admin Dashboard is open. To obtain this, the best path is via the Catalog > Products page, where we can use filters, especially the quantity filter (From/To), to narrow down to items with QTY 2-3. Then we may need to show a "Size" column via the grid's Columns selector, if not already visible, to capture sizes. Alternatively, Reports > Low Stock could show low quantities, but it may not show size clearly. The Catalog product grid allows filters and column customization and will likely display size attribute in a column. Therefore, the next step is to navigate to CATALOG > Products. I will click on the CATALOG menu item in the left navigation to proceed to the products section.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the left navigation and focused the “CATALOG” menu. No data extraction has occurred yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is the Magento Admin Dashboard with the CATALOG submenu expanded, which is on the critical path toward the goal. Relevant interactive elements:
- Link “Products” ([201]) — visible and clickable; this should lead to the product grid where quantity filters and size attributes can be accessed.
- Link “Categories” ([204]) — visible and clickable; not directly relevant to the goal.
- Dashboard content (tabs like “Bestsellers”) — visible but not relevant to filtering by inventory quantity or viewing product sizes.

The necessary next step to progress is to navigate to “Products” ([201]) to filter for items with quantity 2–3 and expose/confirm the “Size” attribute for each matching product.

The user's goal is to retrieve product names and their sizes for products that have 2–3 units left. This requires accessing the product catalog grid where inventory quantities and attribute columns (like Size) can be filtered/viewed. On the current Magento Admin Dashboard, the left navigation menu for CATALOG is already expanded, showing "Products" and "Categories." To proceed efficiently (per tips about using search/filters instead of scrolling), I should navigate to CATALOG > Products. From there, I can use the grid filter for Quantity (From 2 To 3), and ensure the Size column is visible via the Columns selector if needed.

✅ Current Progress: Reached the Catalog > Products grid. A Quantity filter is applied for 3–3, showing 2 records. No extraction of product names and sizes has been completed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal. However, the current filter only includes products with exactly 3 units left and excludes those with 2 units.
- Relevant elements:
  - button 'Filters' ([890]) — visible/enabled; needed to adjust the quantity range.
  - Active filters list ([895]) shows “Quantity: 3 - 3” with a remove button ([899]); “Clear all” button ([902]) is also available.
  - button 'Columns' ([767]) — visible/enabled; may be needed to expose a “Size” column if not already shown.
  - table ([1731]) with headers including 'Name' ([1753]) and '↓ Quantity' ([1763]); “2 records found” indicator is visible.
  - Example visible row name cell: 'Eos V-Neck Hoodie-S-Blue' ([1787]); size is not a dedicated column currently.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button 'Filters' ([890]) to open filters and adjust the Quantity range to include From 2 To 3, then apply the filters.

The user wants product names and sizes for items with 2–3 units left. I’m on CATALOG > Products, and the grid shows an active filter “Quantity: 2 - 3” with “2 records found.” The table displays two matching products. The grid does not offer a dedicated “Size” column in the Columns selector, but the size appears embedded in the product names as “-S-” and “-XS-”. I will extract the sizes directly from the product names while preserving exact product name formatting (including ™). The two products shown are:
- “Eos V-Neck Hoodie-S-Blue” (size S)
- “Minerva LumaTech™ V-Tee-XS-Blue” (size XS)
I will report these to the user.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Catalog > Products.
- Set and applied Quantity filter to From=2, To=3 (active filter shows “Quantity: 2 - 3”; grid reports “2 records found”).
- Opened Columns selector; no dedicated “Size” column visible. The two matching product names are visible in the grid and include size tokens (e.g., “-S-”, “-XS-”).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The Products grid is directly on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant elements and states:
  - Filters: “Quantity: 2 - 3” active; “2 records found” visible.
  - Grid columns: Name and Quantity columns visible; data rows rendered.
    - Row 1 Name cell shows “Eos V-Neck Hoodie-S-Blue” (visible).
    - Row 2 Name cell shows “Minerva LumaTech™ V-Tee-XS-Blue” (visible).
  - Columns button [767]: open; multiple columns toggles listed (e.g., ID, Name, Quantity, Manufacturer, Color), but no “Size” column option observed.
- Interpretation: Sizes are not available as a separate column here; however, the size appears embedded in the product names for the two filtered items (S and XS). No deviation detected; the page contains the needed records to extract names and sizes.
