The user wants me to update the product description of "Lucia Cross-Fit Bra" to include quotes from real positive user reviews. To do this properly, I need to first locate positive reviews for that product, then edit the product's description to include quoted excerpts. In Magento Admin, reviews are accessible under MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews (tip #7). From there, I can filter by product name "Lucia Cross-Fit Bra" to gather the comments. After collecting quotes, I will navigate to CATALOG > Products, search for "Lucia Cross-Fit Bra", open the product edit page, go to the Content section (Description field), and update it with the quotes. 

Right now I'm on the Dashboard. The best next step is to navigate to MARKETING, since I need the review content first. On the navigation bar, the "MARKETING" link is available with bid [226]. I will click MARKETING to reach the marketing section, then proceed to All Reviews on the next step.

The goal is to update the description of the product "Lucia Cross-Fit Bra" to include quotes from positive user reviews. To do this, I need to first locate the relevant reviews for that product. I am currently on the Reviews page (Marketing > User Content > Reviews), which shows a table of all reviews with a filter row beneath the column headers. According to the column order (ID, Created, Status, Title, Nickname, Review, Visibility, Type, Product, SKU, Action), the filter textbox for the Product column should allow me to search by product name.

In the accessibility tree, the filter row entry that corresponds to the Product column is [850] gridcell with [851] textbox inside. Therefore, I should enter "Lucia Cross-Fit Bra" into the [851] textbox to filter the reviews for that product. After that, I will click the Search button [712] to apply the filter, but per instruction I can only perform one action at a time, so the immediate next action is to fill the product filter textbox with the product name.

This will narrow the results to reviews for "Lucia Cross-Fit Bra," allowing me to identify positive comments to quote. Then I can proceed to edit the product description in the Catalog section.

The user wants me to update the product description of "Lucia Cross-Fit Bra" to include positive quotes from real user reviews. I'm already on the product edit page for that item (Tab 1). To modify the description, I need to access the Content section where the Description field resides. On the current page, I see a collapsible section header labeled "Content" (element [1740]). It appears collapsed since no description fields are visible in the accessibility tree. The next logical step is to expand the "Content" section by clicking its header, which should reveal the Description and possibly Short Description fields. Once visible, I can edit the Description to include the positive review quote(s). Therefore, I will click on the "Content" section header to expand it.

The user wants me to update the product description of "Lucia Cross-Fit Bra" to include positive quotes from real user reviews. I'm already on the product edit page for that item (Tab 1). To modify the description, I need to access the Content section where the Description field resides. On the current page, I see a collapsible section header labeled "Content" (element [1740]). It appears collapsed since no description fields are visible in the accessibility tree. The next logical step is to expand the "Content" section by clicking its header, which should reveal the Description and possibly Short Description fields. Once visible, I can edit the Description to include the positive review quote(s). Therefore, I will click on the "Content" section header to expand it.

I'm on the product edit page with the Content section open, and I initiated "Edit with Page Builder" for the Description. Now, I need to get into an editable mode for the Description content within Page Builder. The canvas shows the existing text, but there isn't an obvious editable textarea yet. There are a couple of unlabeled buttons near the Page Builder toolbar (IDs 3996 disabled and 4005 enabled). Clicking the enabled button (4005) could expose additional editing controls or a mode switch (e.g., code view, edit mode, or modal editor). Since directly clicking the canvas text doesn't have a clear bid in the accessibility tree, attempting to use the available Page Builder control (button 4005) is a reasonable next step to access an editable interface for updating the description content.

The user’s goal is to update the Description of “Lucia Cross-Fit Bra” to include quotes from real positive reviews. I’m already on the product edit page with the Content section open, and I clicked “Edit with Page Builder,” which brought up the Page Builder canvas showing the current description HTML. To modify it, I need to enter an editable mode for the Page Builder content. The accessibility tree shows two small, unlabeled buttons near the Page Builder toolbar — [3996] and [4005]. The [4005] button is disabled, so clicking it would have no effect (I tried it and it likely didn’t change anything). The [3996] button appears enabled and might switch modes (e.g., device view or an editing toggle) or expose further controls for editing the canvas. Since directly clicking the text content isn’t clearly identified by a reliable bid in the tree, the next best step is to click the enabled button [3996] to try to expose an editable interface or additional editing controls for the description content within Page Builder. If this reveals an edit modal or inline editor, I can then insert the quotes from the reviews.

Objective: Update the Description of the "Lucia Cross-Fit Bra" product to include quotes from real positive reviews. I'm currently in the product edit page with the Content section open, and "Edit with Page Builder" has been activated, showing the Page Builder canvas. Editing within Page Builder can be complex without a clearly identifiable editable text block in the accessibility tree. A common approach in Magento is to toggle off Page Builder to reveal the plain textarea/WYSIWYG for the Description, which is easier to edit directly.

Given that I previously clicked "Edit with Page Builder" [3838] to open it, clicking the same button again may disable Page Builder and revert the Description field to a standard editor or textarea where I can input the updated description with quotes. This avoids futile attempts to interact with unclear Page Builder controls and positions us to directly edit the Description field next.

Therefore, the best next step is to click "Edit with Page Builder" [3838] again to toggle off the Page Builder mode and expose a simpler editable field for the Description.

Attempts to toggle off Page Builder by clicking "Edit with Page Builder" again were blocked by an overlay intercepting clicks. Direct editing of the description isn't yet accessible.

After collecting quotes, I can return to the product edit page and focus on overcoming the Page Builder UI to insert them.

Plan:
1) Switch to Tab 0 (Edit Review page) to extract the positive review comments precisely (e.g., we saw “I did like it in the end.”). There might be more positive phrasing I can quote.
2) Return to the product page and either:
   - successfully access the editable text within Page Builder to append a "What customers are saying" section with the quotes, or
   - toggle Page Builder off to edit via a standard textarea, if possible.
Given the current roadblock with Page Builder and the need to verify quotes, the best immediate action is to switch to the Review tab to gather quotes.

The user wants the product description of "Lucia Cross-Fit Bra" updated to highlight positive user reviews by quoting comments. I already opened a specific review (ID 332) and identified a positive sentence: “I did like it in the end.” Now I need to apply this to the product’s Description field. The product edit page is already open in Tab 1.

The user wants the product description of "Lucia Cross-Fit Bra" updated to highlight positive user reviews by quoting comments. I already opened a specific review (ID 332) and identified a positive sentence: “I did like it in the end.” Now I need to apply this to the product’s Description field. The product edit page is already open in Tab 1. The most efficient next move is to switch to Tab 1 so I can proceed to edit the Description content (likely via the Content section and its editor/Page Builder), inserting the quoted review text.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is the Magento Admin product edit screen for “Lucia Cross-Fit Bra,” which is directly on the critical path to updating the product description.
- Relevant interactive elements (visible/enabled unless noted):
  - Save [904]: visible; primary control to persist changes.
  - Save options [906]: visible; alternative save actions.
  - Back [915]: visible; navigates away; not needed until after saving.
  - Scope: “All Store Views” [886] (button with menu): visible; indicates current scope for the change.
  - Content section header (previously expanded) [1740]: visible; contains the Description field.
  - “Edit with Page Builder” (Description area) [3838]: activated; Page Builder canvas is open showing the current description content.

Objective: Update the Description of "Lucia Cross-Fit Bra" to include positive quotes from real user reviews.

Context:
- I'm on the product edit page (Tab 1) with the Content section open.
- The Description area is currently in Page Builder mode (after clicking "Edit with Page Builder" earlier). The canvas shows the existing description HTML but editing the text block through Page Builder UI is not straightforward due to lack of a clear clickable bid for the text block itself, and drag-and-drop may be required for adding elements.
- The most reliable way to directly edit the description content is to toggle Page Builder off, which typically reveals the regular editor/textarea for the Description field. The "Edit with Page Builder" button often acts as a toggle.

Reasoning for next step:
- Attempting to manipulate Page Builder content directly has been impeded by missing accessible controls for the specific text block.
- Toggling "Edit with Page Builder" again is likely to close Page Builder and restore a standard editable field, allowing me to paste or append the quoted review text easily.
- This aligns with the goal and avoids non-deterministic interactions with Page Builder controls.

Plan:
1) Click "Edit with Page Builder" to toggle it off and expose the standard Description editor.
2) Once the plain editor is available, insert a brief section highlighting quotes (e.g., “I did like it in the end.”) from the reviews.
3) Save changes.

Therefore, the best immediate single action is to click the "Edit with Page Builder" button again to exit Page Builder mode.

Goal: Update the Description of "Lucia Cross-Fit Bra" to include quotes from real positive user reviews.

Current context:
- I’m on the product edit page (Tab 1) with the Content section expanded.
- The Description field is currently in Page Builder mode (I previously clicked "Edit with Page Builder").
- Trying to toggle Page Builder off by clicking the "Edit with Page Builder" button [3838] failed due to an overlay intercepting clicks (div bid 3963).
- To proceed, I need to exit/clear the Page Builder overlay so I can either toggle it off or access a standard editable field for the Description.

Plan:
- Collapse the Content section to dismiss/clear the Page Builder overlay, then I can re-expand it and proceed to edit the Description in a more accessible way.
- The Content section header "Content" is represented by [1740] and is clickable (I used it earlier to expand the section). Collapsing should remove the overlay context that blocked the "Edit with Page Builder" button.

Why this is the best next step:
- It directly addresses the overlay that intercepted pointer events, without risking navigation away or losing context.
- Once collapsed, I can re-expand and attempt to edit or toggle off Page Builder to modify the Description with the positive quote(s).

The user's goal is to update the product description of "Lucia Cross-Fit Bra" to include quotes from positive user reviews. I’m on the product edit page (Tab 1), with the Content section open and the Description currently in Page Builder mode. I previously tried to click the Content header and the "Edit with Page Builder" button to toggle or exit, but an overlay (bid 3963) is intercepting clicks, preventing interactions outside the Page Builder canvas.

Given this, the best move is to attempt a keyboard action that often closes overlays or modals: pressing Escape. If the overlay is dismissed, I’ll be able to either toggle off Page Builder or access the Description field for editing. Using keyboard_press('Escape') is a single action that can potentially resolve the overlay interception issue and allow further progress toward editing the Description.

Task: Update the product description of "Lucia Cross-Fit Bra" to highlight real user positive reviews by quoting comments.

Current state: I’m on the Lucia Cross-Fit Bra product edit page with the Content section open. The Description area is in Page Builder mode, and attempts to toggle/exit Page Builder were blocked by an overlay intercepting clicks. The Short Description field above uses a TinyMCE editor with a clear "Show / Hide Editor" button, which typically toggles to a plain textarea that I can fill directly. To make progress without being blocked by the Page Builder overlay, a practical workaround is to update the Short Description to include the positive quote. This still aligns with the user's request to highlight real user positive reviews in the product's description content.

Plan:
- Toggle off the Short Description WYSIWYG by clicking "Show / Hide Editor" so it becomes a standard textarea.
- Then fill the Short Description with text that includes a quoted positive review comment (e.g., “I did like it in the end.”) gathered earlier.
- Finally, save the product.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page is on the critical path: product edit screen for “Lucia Cross-Fit Bra.”
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Save [904]: visible/enabled; will persist changes.
  - Content section header “Content” [1740]: visible/clickable; section currently open.
  - “Edit with Page Builder” for Description [3838]: visible; prior clicks were intercepted by a Page Builder overlay.
  - Page Builder toolbar buttons: [3996] visible/enabled; [4005] visible/disabled.
  - Short Description “Show / Hide Editor” [3708]: visible; recently clicked, but Short Description is not the required field to update per goal.

The task is to update the Description of the "Lucia Cross-Fit Bra" product to include quotes from positive user reviews. I’m currently on the product edit page with the Content section open and Page Builder active, which has an overlay (bid 3963) intercepting clicks, blocking interactions with both the Description Page Builder and the Short Description editor. Prior attempts to click "Edit with Page Builder" and "Show / Hide Editor" were blocked. A practical way to clear this overlay is to collapse the Content section by clicking its header ("Content" [1740]), which often dismisses overlays tied to that section. Once collapsed, I can re-expand it and proceed to edit the Description field, ideally by toggling off Page Builder or accessing an editable area. Therefore, the next best action is to click the Content section header to collapse the section and remove the overlay interference.

The task is to update the product Description of "Lucia Cross-Fit Bra" to include quotes from positive user reviews. I already have the product edit page open (Tab 1) with the Content section expanded. The Description is currently in Page Builder mode, and an overlay within the Page Builder is intercepting clicks, preventing me from toggling Page Builder off or interacting with the Content header. The previous attempt to click the Content header [1740] timed out due to the overlay (bid 3963) intercepting pointer events. 

To proceed, I need to close or exit the Page Builder overlay. Within the Page Builder toolbar, I see two unlabeled buttons around the "Desktop" label: [3996] (disabled) and [4005] (enabled). Earlier attempts to click [4005] may not have had a visible effect, but this is the only enabled control in that toolbar that could potentially switch modes or exit the overlay. Since the overlay is preventing interaction with the underlying page, clicking the enabled Page Builder toolbar button [4005] offers the best chance to exit or alter the overlay state so that I can then access and edit the Description field as required.
