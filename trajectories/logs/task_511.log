 <think>
The user wants to add a laundry detergent to their wish list. I need to locate a laundry detergent product and then use the "Add to Wish List" action on that product. The homepage shows various product showcases but none obviously appear to be laundry detergent. The top navigation has categories, but using the search bar is likely faster for this specific item. There is a search combobox labeled "Search" (bid 273) with a disabled Search button (bid 278). I should enter "laundry detergent" into the search field to enable the search button, which I can click in the next step to view relevant results and then add one to the wish list.

<action>
```fill('273', 'laundry detergent')```
