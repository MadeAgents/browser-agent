The user wants the walking distance between Carnegie Mellon University and UPMC Shadyside using the OpenStreetMap site. On the current page, I see the main OSM homepage with a search field and a link labeled "Find directions between two points" (bid 167). According to the task tips, using the two-arrow directions feature is the correct approach for route and distance measurement, and we should use filters (i.e., mode selection) to choose walking.

First step: open the directions panel by clicking the "Find directions between two points" link. This should bring up the From/To fields and allow selecting "Walking". Then I will enter "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" as the start and "UPMC Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA" as the destination, select walking, and get the distance. But per instructions, I can only execute a single action at a time. The next best action is to click the directions link (bid 167) to open the directions UI.
