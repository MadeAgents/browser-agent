The user wants the nearest Five Guys to "5700 Penn Ave" and the walking distance to it, using the current OpenStreetMap site. The best workflow on OSM is:
1) Search for the address to center the map on the correct location (Pittsburgh, PA).
2) Use either search to find "Five Guys" nearby or the directions tool. The directions tool can be efficient: set the starting point to the address and the destination as "Five Guys", which typically picks the closest result by distance, then select "walking" to get walking distance.
First step: focus is already on the Search textbox (id 162). I should fill it with "5700 Penn Ave, Pittsburgh, PA" and then click Go to locate the address. After the map updates and search results appear in the left panel, I can proceed to directions. For now, I will enter the address because that is the necessary first step.

- From: Whole Foods Market, 5700 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA (correct start)
- To: A Five Guys in Paris (incorrect destination)

The distance shown (1779km) confirms the destination is wrong. To get a relevant local result, I should update the "To" field to search within Pittsburgh. Entering “Five Guys, Pittsburgh, PA” will constrain the geocoder to local results near the starting point. After that, I can press Enter to resolve and then switch to Foot mode to get walking distance. Since only one action is allowed now, the next best step is to fill the "To" field with “Five Guys, Pittsburgh, PA”.

✅ Current Progress:
- OpenStreetMap Directions panel is open.
- “From” field [194] is correctly set to 5700 Penn Ave (Whole Foods Market).
- “To” field [199] has been updated to “Five Guys, Pittsburgh, PA” but the route has not been recalculated yet.
- Current route display still shows an old, irrelevant result (1779 km, 18:48) from a previous incorrect destination.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- Page is on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant elements and states:
  - “To” textbox [199]: value='Five Guys, Pittsburgh, PA', focused; visible and editable; needs confirmation to resolve to a specific nearby location.
  - “From” textbox [194]: value='Whole Foods Market, 5700 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA'; correct.
  - Mode radios: “Car” [173] checked=true; “Foot” [179] visible and unchecked.
  - Distance/Time status: [510]=1779km, [511]=18:48 (outdated; indicates route hasn’t been recalculated).
  - Directions services combobox [182]: value='OSRM'; enabled.
- The current displayed route is unrelated, likely because the new destination hasn’t been submitted.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Press Enter in the “To” textbox [199] to resolve “Five Guys, Pittsburgh, PA” and compute a local route.
- After the route appears, switch to walking mode by clicking the “Foot” radio [179] to obtain the walking distance.
