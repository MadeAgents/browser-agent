The user wants to add a new color option "brown" to size S for the product "Phoebe Zipper Sweatshirt".

First, I need to reach the product list to find "Phoebe Zipper Sweatshirt". On the current Dashboard page, the top navigation contains a "CATALOG" link.

The goal is to add a new color option Brown to size S for the configurable product "Phoebe Zipper Sweatshirt." I am already on the product’s edit page, and I can see the Configurations section with the "Edit Configurations" button [1793]. Since Size and Color are the configurable attributes (their comboboxes are disabled, indicating they’re tied to configurations), the correct workflow is to open the configurations wizard via "Edit Configurations."

The user wants to add only the S-Brown variant to the configurable product. In Magento’s configuration wizard Step 2, selected values generate all combinations. Currently, Size has XS, S, M, L, XL selected, and Color has Gray, Purple, White selected. Brown is available but not selected. To avoid generating unwanted combinations (e.g., Brown for all sizes), I should first narrow the Size selection to only S and the Color selection to only Brown. Since I can only perform one action per step, the best next action is to click “Deselect All” for the Size group to clear all size selections, so I can then select S only in a subsequent step.
