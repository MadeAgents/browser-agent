The user wants the walkway (walking directions) to the closest Japanese food market from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh. On OpenStreetMap, the best approach is:
1) Use the search box to locate "401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh, PA" and center the map there. The search textbox [162] is currently focused, and there is a "Go" button [165].
2) Once centered, search for "Japanese market" or a known nearby POI like "Tokyo Japanese Food Store" near the centered location to identify the closest Japanese food market.
3) Use the "Find directions between two points" tool to set the starting point as the address and the destination as the chosen Japanese market, and select walking route.

Since only one action is allowed at a time, the next step is to fill the search box with "401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh, PA" so I can click "Go" after.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap’s main map—relevant for finding locations and walking directions. Key elements:
- Textbox labeled “Search” ([162]) — value set to “401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh, PA”, focused.
- “Go” button ([165]) — visible/enabled; not yet clicked, so the map is still not centered on the address (current view appears unrelated).
- “Find directions between two points” link ([167]) — visible; will be needed to generate a walking route once origin and destination are set.
- Optional UI: “Close” button ([217]) for the welcome overlay; map controls like “Zoom In” ([434]) and “Zoom Out” ([436]) are available but not required yet.
The page is on the critical path; next logical step is to run the address search, then locate the nearest Japanese food market and use the directions tool.

The task is to find the walking route (walkway) from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh to the closest Japanese food market using the current OpenStreetMap directions page. The directions panel is visible with travel mode set to Foot (the radio “Foot” is checked). The “From” field contains the coordinates 40.4552245, -79.9211332, which correspond to 401 Shady Ave. The “To” field is empty. 

Next, I should search for a destination by entering a query into the “To” textbox. A good generic query to find the nearest relevant POI is “Japanese market”, which should surface Japanese grocery/food markets near the origin in Pittsburgh. After entering this, I can then either select the closest result from suggestions or let the routing engine compute based on the nearest match.

Given only one action is allowed per step, I will fill the “To” field with “Japanese market” to initiate the destination search.

The goal is to find the walking route from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh to the closest Japanese food market using the OpenStreetMap directions interface. The current page shows the directions panel:
- Mode radios are visible and the "Foot" option is checked (walking).
- "From" textbox [194] is filled with "Kenmawr Apartments, 401, Shady Avenue, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15206, United States" which is our correct origin.
- "To" textbox [199] currently has "Japanese market" and is focused.

To proceed, OpenStreetMap typically computes a route when you either select a suggested destination or press Enter in the destination field. There isn’t a dedicated "Go" button within the directions panel besides "Reverse Directions." Since the "To" field is already populated with the query, the next logical action is to submit this query by pressing Enter in the "To" field, allowing OSM to search and either pick the nearest match or present options. If suggestions appear afterward, I can select the closest one. For now, I will trigger the routing by sending Enter to the "To" field.

The user wants walking directions (“walkway”) from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh to the closest Japanese food market using the current OpenStreetMap page. The page already shows the Directions panel set to Foot (walking), with a computed route from “Kenmawr Apartments, 401 Shady Avenue, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA 15206, United States” to “Tokyo Japanese Food Store, 5855 Ellsworth Avenue, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, United States.” The summary shows Distance: 1.0km and Time: 0:13, and the step-by-step instructions are listed (though they appear as “unnamed road” segments typical for paths/alleys). Tokyo Japanese Food Store is a Japanese grocery and very likely the closest Japanese food market to that origin in Shadyside. Since the route is already computed and visible, the next best action is to report the result to the user succinctly with the destination’s full address including ZIP code, total distance/time, and the listed steps from the directions table.

The user wants the walking route to the closest Japanese food market from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh, using the current OpenStreetMap page. The page already shows the Directions panel with:
- Travel mode set to Foot (walking).
- From: Kenmawr Apartments, 401 Shady Avenue, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA 15206, United States.
- To: Tokyo Japanese Food Store, 5855 Ellsworth Avenue, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, United States.
- Summary: Distance 1.0km, Time 0:13.
- A step-by-step list of directions (mostly “unnamed road” segments), which is typical for footpaths/alleys in OSM.
Since the route is computed and visible and includes the full addresses with ZIP codes from OpenStreetMap, the best action now is to present the result succinctly to the user, including the destination address, origin, distance/time, and the steps exactly as shown.
