The user wants a new marketing price rule for Pride Month with 45% off on all products for all customers. In Magento, price rules are managed under the Marketing menu, typically as Cart Price Rules (apply in cart) or Catalog Price Rules (apply to product prices). Since the instruction says "marketing price rule," that's usually under MARKETING > Promotions. I should navigate to the MARKETING section first. From there, I can choose the appropriate "Cart Price Rules" option to create a rule that applies to all customers with a 45% discount, and later set the date range for June (Pride Month). The current page is the Dashboard. The MARKETING link is visible with bid [226]. The next best action is to click the MARKETING menu to access promotions/rules.

The user's goal is to create a marketing price rule for Pride Month with a 45% discount on all products for all customers.

The current page shows the Marketing menu expanded, with both "Catalog Price Rule" and "Cart Price Rules" visible.

We are on the "New Cart Price Rule" page where we can configure a new promotion. To draft the rule, we need to populate several required fields and then configure the Actions to apply a 45% percent discount to all products, for all customers, ideally scheduled for Pride Month. Since only one action is allowed per step, the most logical first step is to fill the required "Rule Name" field to identify the promotion clearly. After this, we will proceed to select the website(s), select all customer groups, set the date range (June), and configure the Actions to set a 45% discount. I will start by filling the Rule Name field.

The goal is to create a cart price rule that gives 45% off on all products for all customers during Pride Month. On the “New Cart Price Rule” page, we already have:
- Rule Name filled as “Pride Month 45% Off”
- Active set to Yes
- Websites selected (Main Website)
- Coupon: No Coupon
We need to ensure “all customers” are included by selecting all customer groups in the multiselect list. The list shows four options (NOT LOGGED IN, General, Wholesale, Retailer) with only the first one ([815]) currently selected. To add additional selections without deselecting the current one, I should Ctrl-click each remaining option. The next incremental step is to select “General” ([816]) using ControlOrMeta to preserve the existing selection.

Since only one action is allowed per step, the most immediate necessary action is to set the required Discount Amount field under Actions to 45. After that, I will set the From/To dates and save.

The user wants a new cart price rule for Pride Month offering 45% off on all products for all customers. I’m on the New Cart Price Rule page with most required fields already configured:

To complete the Pride Month schedule, I need to set the To date to the end of June. The “To” field [870] is currently empty. The next logical step is to fill the “To” field with 06/30/2025, after which I can save the rule.

The user asked to draft a new marketing price rule for Pride Month with 45% off on all products for all customers. I navigated to Marketing > Cart Price Rules, clicked Add New Rule, and configured the new rule:
- Rule Name set to “Pride Month 45% Off.”
- Active = Yes.
- Websites = Main Website selected.
- Customer Groups = NOT LOGGED IN, General, Wholesale, Retailer (all customers).
- Coupon = No Coupon (auto-applied).
- Date range set From 06/01/2025 to 06/30/2025.
- Actions set to “Percent of product price discount” with Discount Amount = 45.
- No conditions so it applies to all products.
I saved the rule and returned to the list page, where the success banner “You saved the rule.” is visible, and the rules table shows a new entry with the same name and dates (ID 13). I also noticed there is another existing rule with the same name (ID 8) for the same date range. With both rules active and default priority 0, Magento could stack discounts or behave unexpectedly depending on settings. The best next step is to inform the user the new rule is created and ask if they want me to disable the older one or adjust priorities to avoid duplication. I will send a concise status message with details and a follow-up question.
