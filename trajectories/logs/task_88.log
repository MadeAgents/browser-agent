The user wants the estimated driving time from Homewood Suites Southpointe to PPG Paints Arena. On the OpenStreetMap page, the best way is to use the directions feature. I see the "Find directions between two points" link with the two-arrow icon (bid 167) next to the search bar. Clicking it should open the directions pane where I can input the origin and destination and get routing details like time and distance. Since no progress has been made yet, the first step is to open the directions interface.

The user needs the estimated driving time from Homewood Suites Southpointe to PPG Paints Arena using the OpenStreetMap directions tool.
