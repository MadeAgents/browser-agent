The user asks for driving time from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia. On the OpenStreetMap page, there's a link labeled "Find directions between two points" (id [167]) near the search area. According to the provided tips, to find routes we should use this two-arrow directions feature, then enter the start and end locations and press the 'press' (route) button to compute the route and see the time. The current map is centered on Hong Kong, but that doesn't matter as the directions panel will accept city names. The next best action is to open the directions panel by clicking the "Find directions between two points" link. This should reveal the two input fields for start and end points and the route calculation controls.

✅ Current Progress: No progress made yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is OpenStreetMap with the directions panel open, which is directly relevant to finding driving time between cities.
- Mode selection:
  - [173] radio labeled “Car” is checked (correct for the goal).
  - [176] “Bicycle” and [179] “Foot” are unchecked.
- Routing service:
  - [182] combobox “Directions services” is set to “OSRM” (expanded=False; options available: GraphHopper, OSRM, Valhalla). OSRM is suitable.
- Route inputs:
  - [194] textbox labeled “From” is visible and currently empty.
  - [199] textbox labeled “To” is visible and currently empty.
- Controls:
  - [200] button “Reverse Directions” is visible/enabled.
  - [187] button “Close” (closes the directions panel; not needed for the goal).

To proceed toward the goal, the essential action is to enter the origin and destination into [194] “From” and [199] “To” and compute the route; the result will include driving time.

The user wants the driving time from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with mode set to Car and OSRM selected, which is appropriate.
