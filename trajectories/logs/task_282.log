The user wants slide slippers from Nike and the price range of available products.

✅ Current Progress: Hovered over the “Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry” category to access its sub-menu. No Nike slide slipper products have been listed yet; price range not determined.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is the site’s home with global navigation visible—this is on the critical path toward finding Nike slide slippers.
- Relevant navigation elements to drill down:
  - menuitem “Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry” (node [543], hasPopup=menu) — currently targeted via hover.
  - sub-menu items under this category:
    - menuitem “Men” (node [548], hasPopup=menu, visible)
    - menuitem “Women” (node [562], hasPopup=menu, visible)
    - menuitem “Novelty & More” (node [579], hasPopup=menu, visible)
    - menuitem “Sport Specific Clothing” (node [587], hasPopup=menu, visible)
  These sub-menus likely contain deeper links (e.g., Shoes/Slippers/Slides) needed to reach product listings where brand filters (Nike) can be applied.
- Search tools:
  - combobox “Search” (node [273], empty; autocomplete enabled; hasPopup=listbox)
  - button “Search” (node [278], disabled until a query is entered)
  - link “Advanced Search” (node [276], available)
No product grid relevant to “Nike slide slippers” is open yet. The next critical step is to navigate into the appropriate Shoes/Slippers/Slides subcategory (via Men or Women) and then filter by Nike, or use the Search/Advanced Search with a targeted query.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the menuitem “Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry” (id=543) to open its submenu, then proceed into the appropriate footwear category to reach slides/slippers listings.
- Alternatively, type “Nike slide slippers” into the “Search” combobox (id=273), then click the “Search” button (id=278) once it becomes enabled.

The user wants the full product names of Nike slide slippers and the price range of the available products. We are already on the search results page for “Nike slide slippers,” showing a grid of 12 items (items 1–12 of many). I should extract only the Nike slide slippers from the visible results and note their prices to compute the range.

From the product grid, I identify the Nike slide slippers and their adjacent prices:
- Nike Victori One Mens Comfort Slide Cn9675-003 (Midnight Navy/Midnight Navy/White, Numeric_10) — $36.86
- Nike Men's Air Max Camden Slide Sandal — $69.00
- Nike Men's Benassi JDI Fanny Pack Slides — $54.94
- Nike Offcourt Slide Mens Bq4639-002 Size 12 — $48.61
- Nike Jordan Men's Break Slide Red AR6374-602 — $42.81
- Nike Victori One Slide Mens Style : Dd9559-300 — $61.00
- Nike Men's Benassi Solarsoft Slide Athletic Sandal (Black/White, numeric_14) — $39.95
- Nike Men's Benassi Solarsoft Slide Athletic Sandal (Midnight Navy/Blue, numeric_8) — $90.65

I exclude non-Nike items and unrelated products like “Nike Men's Pro Heist Dri-FIT Baseball Sliding Shorts” and brands like HUTSENDOX, as they are not Nike slides.

Compute price range: min = $36.86, max = $90.65. I will present the list of full names and the price range, clarifying that it’s based on currently visible results on this page.

The user wants the full product names of Nike slide slippers and the price range of the available products. We are already on the search results page for “Nike slide slippers,” showing a grid of 12 items (items 1–12 of many). I should extract only the Nike slide slippers from the visible results and note their prices to compute the range.

From the product grid, I identify the Nike slide slippers and their adjacent prices:
- Nike Victori One Mens Comfort Slide Cn9675-003 (Midnight Navy/Midnight Navy/White, Numeric_10) — $36.86
- Nike Men's Air Max Camden Slide Sandal — $69.00
- Nike Men's Benassi JDI Fanny Pack Slides — $54.94
- Nike Offcourt Slide Mens Bq4639-002 Size 12 — $48.61
- Nike Jordan Men's Break Slide Red AR6374-602 — $42.81
- Nike Victori One Slide Mens Style : Dd9559-300 — $61.00
- Nike Men's Benassi Solarsoft Slide Athletic Sandal (Black/White, numeric_14) — $39.95
- Nike Men's Benassi Solarsoft Slide Athletic Sandal (Midnight Navy/Blue, numeric_8) — $90.65

I exclude non-Nike items and unrelated products like “Nike Men's Pro Heist Dri-FIT Baseball Sliding Shorts” and brands like HUTSENDOX, as they are not Nike slides.

Compute price range: min = $36.86, max = $90.65. I will present the list of full names and the price range, clarifying that it’s based on currently visible results on this page.
