The goal is to post the question in a specialized, active forum where AI agent and web navigation topics are discussed. The current page is the “List of forums” with many general forums (technology, science, etc.), but the Task Tips advise: to find a relevant subreddit/forum, click "Alphabetical" in the "Forum" tab to locate specific names like f/MachineLearning or f/deeplearning. Using the alphabetical listing will make it easier to scan for the exact specialized forum rather than paginating through popular ones. Therefore, the next best step is to click the "Alphabetical" link (bid 117) to switch the listing to alphabetical order and then locate a suitable AI-focused forum to post in.

The current "All forums" page is already in alphabetical view, and I can see "MachineLearning" (bid 238) and "deeplearning" (bid 166). Given the question is about the SOTA web navigation agent repo, f/MachineLearning is broader and typically more active, increasing the likelihood of getting informed responses. The correct workflow is to first navigate to the relevant forum, then click Submit within that forum to create the post. Therefore, the next step is to click the "MachineLearning" forum link.

On the "Create submission" page, the Title and Body fields both contain the exact question text (“what is the SOTA web navigation agent repo”), the Forum combobox is set to "MachineLearning," and the URL field is intentionally left empty per the posting guidelines. The preview shows the correct content. With all required fields satisfied (Title is required and filled), the next logical step is to submit the post by clicking the "Create submission" button.

The user's goal was to post the question in a subreddit where it's likely to get an answer. We navigated to the forums list, chose the specialized and active MachineLearning forum (per the Task Tips recommending f/MachineLearning or f/deeplearning), opened the submission form, filled the Title and Body with the exact question text, left the URL empty, and created the submission. The current page shows the submitted post detail in /f/MachineLearning, confirming success. The sidebar also provides a short URL (http://10.177.37.113:9999/10). The best next step is to inform the user that the post is live, provide the link, and offer to cross-post to f/deeplearning for additional reach, aligning with maximizing answers.
