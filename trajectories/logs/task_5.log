The user asks for the top-1 best-selling product type in January 2023. To find best-selling products for a specific date range in Magento, I should navigate to the Reports section, then to a product-related report such as "Products" > "Ordered" or "Bestsellers." Those reports typically allow setting a date range (From and To) and then show products ordered by quantity. Once I identify the top-1 product for Jan 2023, I will extract its type (e.g., "band", "ball", "bag") rather than the exact product name, per the instruction about product types. 

Currently, I am on the Dashboard page. The next logical step is to click the REPORTS tab in the top navigation to access the various report options. I will then proceed to choose an appropriate report where I can set dates, filter for January 2023, and read the first product. For now, I will click the REPORTS link to proceed.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the Reports section from the Magento Admin dashboard; the Reports menu overlay is visible with report categories and links.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is on the critical path to find the top-1 best-selling product type for January 2023. The Reports menu (link “[339] REPORTS”, focused) is open, showing relevant product reports:
- Products > “Bestsellers” (link [431]) — visible, focusable.
- Products > “Ordered” (link [437]) — visible, focusable.
- Other product-related links: “Views” (link [428]), “Low Stock” (link [434]), “Downloads” (link [440]) — visible, focusable.

To determine best sellers for a specific date range (Jan 1–31, 2023), the “Bestsellers” [431] report is the most relevant, as it typically supports date filtering and ranking by quantity sold. The current overlay suggests these links are enabled and ready to be clicked.

The user asks for the top-1 best-selling product type in January 2023. To find this in Magento, I should use the Reports section, specifically a product-related report that supports date filtering and ranks by quantity sold. The current page shows the Reports overlay with categories including “Products” and links such as “Bestsellers” and “Ordered.” The “Bestsellers” report is appropriate for identifying top-selling products within a date range. 

My plan:
1. Click the “Bestsellers” link under Reports > Products.
2. On the Bestsellers report page, set the date range to From 01/01/2023 To 01/31/2023 (Jan 2023).
3. Click “Show Report.”
4. Read the first row (top-1 best seller) and determine its “product type” as requested (per benchmark guidance, not the exact product name but the type of product it is).
5. Report the result to the user.

Currently, the Reports overlay is visible and the “Bestsellers” link [431] is on screen. I will click it to proceed.

The user needs the top-1 best-selling product type in January 2023. I'm on the Bestsellers Report page, which has filters for Period, From, and To. To get a single monthly view for January 2023, it’s best to set Period to "Month" so the "Interval" groups by month rather than day. Then I will set the date range to the month (01/01/2023 to 01/31/2023) and run the report. The immediate next step is to change the Period from "Day" to "Month" using the Period combobox [753].

I’m already on the Bestsellers Report page with filters set to Period = Month, From = 1/1/23, To = 1/31/23, and the report is displayed. The results table shows the first (top) product for the interval 1/2023 as “Impulse Duffle” with Order Quantity 2. Per the benchmark rule about “product type,” I should not return the product name but the type/category it represents. “Impulse Duffle” is a duffle bag, which falls under the Bags type. Therefore, the top-1 best-selling product type in Jan 2023 is “Bags.” I will now provide this concise answer to the user.
