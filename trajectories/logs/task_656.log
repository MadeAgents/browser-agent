The user wants me to fill out the "Contact Us" form with specific details for a refund request. I am currently on the home page of "One Stop Market." In the footer of the page, there is a clearly labeled link "Contact Us" with accessibility node [1862]. To access the form, I should click this link. This aligns with the task tips: using navigation menus rather than searching or scrolling. Once on the Contact Us page, I will look for fields like name, email, subject, and message, and fill in the details including order number #180 and the product SKU, and mention that the remote controller broke after three days of use. For now, the next best single action is to click "Contact Us" to open the form.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current “My Account” page is relevant to the goal because it can provide the product SKU via order details.
- Relevant elements to proceed:
  - Left navigation link “My Orders” (marker [1451] in screenshot) — visible and clickable.
  - “Recent Orders” table with per-row “View Order” links (e.g., markers [1487], [1488], [1489], [1490] in screenshot) — visible and clickable; use these to open the specific order and view its item details/SKU.
  - Footer link “Contact Us” (axtree [1862]) — visible; use to return to the contact form once SKU is obtained.
- Non-essential elements on this page include address and newsletter sections (axtree [1390], [1404], [1376]), which do not contribute to finding the SKU.
- The page is on the critical path: obtain SKU from order #180, then return to the Contact Us form to compose the refund message including “broke after three days,” order number #180, and the product SKU.

The goal is to fill out the "Contact Us" form with a refund request, including the order number #180 and the product SKU, and not submit. I’m on the Contact Us page where the Name and Email fields are already populated. The key required field to complete is the message textarea labeled “What’s on your mind? *” with bid [1383]. From the earlier order details for #000000180, the product SKU was identified as B0041MSF2S. I will fill the message field with a concise refund request mentioning the remote controller broke after three days, the order number #180, and the SKU B0041MSF2S. I will not click Submit afterward.
