The user wants to see products under $30 in the "men shoes" category. According to the Task Tips, for shopping/browsing tasks I should navigate using the dropdown menus by hovering over categories. On the current homepage, there's a top navigation menu with "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry" listed as a menu item with a popup menu (bid 656). The correct first step is to hover over this category to reveal its subcategories, where I expect to find "Men" and then "Shoes" or a direct "Men Shoes" option. After the submenu is visible, I can proceed to click the appropriate "Men Shoes" entry, then apply a price filter to show products under $30. Since only one action can be taken at a time, I will start by hovering over "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry".

The user wants to see products under $30 in the Men Shoes category. We are already on the Men > Shoes category page, with 2523 items visible and a sidebar price filter that’s too broad ($0–$99.99). To surface the cheapest items (including those under $30) efficiently without scrolling, I should use the “Sort By” control and sort by Price. The UI shows a combobox “Sort By” with options Position, Product Name, and Price. The “Set Descending Direction” link suggests the current direction is ascending, which is what we want for cheapest-first. Selecting “Price” will reorder the grid to show lower-priced products at the top, making under-$30 items immediately visible. This is the best next step to meet the user's request.

The sidebar price filter only offers broad ranges (e.g., $0–$99.99), which does not meet the “under $30” requirement in the URL.
