The user wants to increase the product’s price by 15%. On the current Magento product edit page, I can see the Price field with value 32.00 at element [985]. To comply with the instruction that all calculations must use the calculate() function, I should first compute the new price: 32.00 * 1.15. After obtaining the result, the next steps will be to update the Price textbox with the computed value and then click Save. For now, I will perform the calculation to get the correct number before editing the field.

The goal is to increase the product’s price by 15%. I have already computed the new price using the required calculate() function: 32.00 * 1.15 = 36.80. On the current Magento product edit page for “Sol Active Short-34-Blue,” the Price textbox is visible with value “32.00” and corresponds to element [985] labeled “[global] Price * $”. The next step is to update this field with the new price “36.80”. After successfully filling the field, I will plan to click “Save” in the following step to persist the change.

The task is to increase the product’s price by 15% and persist the change. Based on the prior steps, I’ve already computed the new price using the required calculate() function (32.00 * 1.15 = 36.80) and updated the “[global] Price * $” field (element [985]) to 36.80. The current page is the Magento Admin product edit screen for “Sol Active Short-34-Blue,” and the Save button (element [876]) is visible in the header. To finalize the update, I need to click Save to commit the new price to the system. This is the next logical step, and I should avoid repeating the previous fill action since the field already contains the updated value.
