The goal is to find the total number of items sold in the most recent 2 orders. According to the task tips, I must retrieve recent orders from the Sales > Orders page and sort them by Purchase Date in descending order at least once. The current page is the Dashboard, which shows a Last Orders widget, but to comply with the requirement I need to go to the Orders grid. The top navigation bar has a "SALES" link (node [156]). Clicking it should navigate to the sales section or open the Orders area where I can then access the Orders grid. My next step is to click the "SALES" menu item to get to the Orders page or its submenu.

✅ Current Progress: Opened the SALES menu from the Dashboard; the Sales submenu is visible.

- Other Sales submenu links (Invoices [171], Shipments [174], etc.) — visible, but not required for the goal.

The goal is to find the total number of items sold in the most recent 2 orders. The page is currently on the Magento Admin Dashboard, with the Sales menu expanded and a visible link to "Orders" (element [168]). To correctly identify the most recent orders, I need to navigate to the Sales > Orders grid, then sort by Purchase Date in descending order as required by the task tips. The "Last Orders" widget on the dashboard is not sufficient since the task explicitly requires sorting on the Orders page.

The grid is currently sorted by Purchase Date in ascending order (older first), as indicated by the column header “↑ Purchase Date” ([1380]). To find the most recent orders, sorting should be switched to descending.
Relevant interactive elements:
- Column header “↑ Purchase Date” ([1380]) — visible, enabled; clicking should toggle sort to show most recent first.
- Orders table ([1358]) with rows ([1399]); example row shows ID “000000299” ([1404]) and date “May 31, 2023 2:55:09 AM” ([1411]) — indicates current top rows are older.
- Pagination controls: previous button ([1123], disabled), page indicator “of 2” ([1124], value=1), next button ([1126], enabled).
- Per page input “per page” ([1094], value=200) — already high enough to likely include most records on one page after sorting.
- Search field “Search by keyword” ([840]) and “Search” button ([841]) — available but not needed for the goal.

Task: Determine total number of items sold in the most recent 2 orders. We must ensure the Orders grid is sorted by Purchase Date in descending order (Task Tip #11) and then open the top two orders to find item counts.

Current page: Sales > Orders grid, 308 records, per-page 200, page 1 of 2. The header shows '↓ Purchase Date', suggesting descending, but the first visible row date is Jan 8, 2022 and then Jan 9, 2022, etc., which indicates ascending order (older to newer). Therefore the current sort is not showing the most recent orders at the top. To comply with the rule and to get the latest two orders without navigating pages, I should click the Purchase Date header again to toggle the sort, which should reorder to newest-first so the most recent orders appear at the top of page 1. After sorting correctly, I will open the first order’s View to get the item count, then navigate back to open the second order. Next immediate action: click the Purchase Date column header to toggle sorting to descending.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is directly on the critical path to determine the most recent orders.

  - Column header “↑ Purchase Date” ([1380]) — visible/enabled; indicates ascending sort (needs descending for latest-first).
  - Orders table ([1358]) with data rows present (e.g., ID cell [1404], date cell [1411]).

  - Column headers include “Action” ([1392]) — used to access order details; items-count not shown among visible headers, so item counts will need to be obtained from order detail pages.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the “Purchase Date” column header to sort by newest first: click element [1380] (“Purchase Date”) to switch to descending order.

The user asks for the total number of items sold in the most recent 2 orders. I’m currently viewing the most recent order page (#000000299). I have inspected the Items Ordered section and noted 5 items (each line shows Qty Ordered = 1 across five products). I saved this as a note. Next, I need to open the second most recent order. To do that, I should return to the Orders grid (which I had sorted by Purchase Date descending earlier per the rule) and then open the second row’s order details. The appropriate next action is to click the “Back” button on this order view page to return to the Orders grid.

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Sales > Orders.
- Sorted by Purchase Date at least once and opened the most recent order (#000000299); recorded item count: 5.
- Returned to the Orders grid.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (“Orders / Operations / Sales / Magento Admin”) is directly on the critical path to the goal.
- The orders grid is visible with 308 records; pagination set to 200 per page ([1094] “per page” value=200; page control [1124] “of 2” showing page 1; next-page button [1126] visible).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Column header “↑ Purchase Date” ([1380]) — clickable; indicates sorting is active by Purchase Date (verify newest-first as required).
  - Table ([1358]) with rows ([1398] rowgroup). The first visible row shows ID [1404] “000000299” and date [1411] “May 31, 2023 2:55:09 AM” (consistent with the order already opened).
  - Column header “Action” ([1392]) — use row-level action to open order details for the second most recent order.
- Remaining work: open the second most recent order from the grid, capture its item count, then sum with the already recorded 5 to answer the goal.

  - Section “Items Ordered” [842] with table [846] — visible; contains line items with “Qty Ordered” values to be summed for this order.
  - Button “Back” [730] — visible/enabled; returns to the Orders grid after capturing the count (if needed).
- Next required action to progress toward the goal: read/sum the “Qty Ordered” values in the Items Ordered table [846] for order #000000065, then add to the previously noted 5 to produce the final total.

The user needs the total number of items sold in the most recent two orders. I have already ensured the Orders grid was sorted by Purchase Date in descending order (as required by Tip #11), opened the most recent order (#000000299), and noted it has 5 items. I navigated back and opened the second most recent order, which is the current page (#000000065). In the Items Ordered section, there are four line items, each with Qty Ordered = 1, totaling 4 items for this order. To provide the final total, I must use the calculate function (Tip #12) to sum 5 (from #000000299) and 4 (from #000000065). The next best action is to compute 5 + 4 using calculate, then I will report the result to the user in the following step.

The task is to find the total number of items sold in the most recent two orders. According to the tips, I must ensure the Orders grid is sorted by Purchase Date in descending order. From the history, I navigated to Sales > Orders, clicked the Purchase Date header to sort descending, then opened the most recent order (#000000299) and counted 5 items from the Items Ordered section. I returned and opened the second most recent order (#000000065) and counted 4 items. To comply with the calculation requirement, I used the calculate function to add 5 + 4 and obtained 9.
