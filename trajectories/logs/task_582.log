The goal is to create a new forum with specific details. I'm on the "Create new forum" page, which has required fields for Name, Title, Description, and Sidebar. The IDs for the inputs are:
- Name: [116]
- Title: [121]
- Description: [126]
- Sidebar: [134]
- Create forum button: [274]

Since all these fields are required, I need to fill each appropriately:
- Name: "Cyberpunk"
- Title: Use "Cyberpunk" (not specified by the user, but typically matches the forum name)
- Description: "Welcome to the future"
- Sidebar: Include the list items. Markdown is allowed, so using bullet points is appropriate:
  - Games
  - Books
  - Movies
  - Future

I'll proceed step-by-step, starting by filling the Name field first.
