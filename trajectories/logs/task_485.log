I see the searchbox labeled "Filter by name" with bid 273. The next step is to type "dotfiles" to locate the repository. Once it appears, I'll click into it, then navigate to Project information > Members and use the Invite Members button to add Vinta with the Guest role.

To proceed with inviting a user, the “Members” management is typically accessed from “Project information” (then Members) on GitLab; use the above links to reach the members page and send the invite with the Guest role.

The user's goal is to invite Vinta to the dotfiles repository as a Guest. I am on the Project members page with the "Invite members" modal open. The "Username or email address" field is already filled with "vinta," and a suggestion list is visible showing a menu item "Vinta Chen vinta." To properly add the user to the invite list, I need to select this suggestion so it becomes a selected token in the field. The role combobox is already set to "Guest," which matches the requested access level. The next best action is to click the "Vinta Chen vinta" menu item to select the user before proceeding to click Invite in a subsequent step.

The task is to invite Vinta to the dotfiles repository as a Guest. I’m on the Project members page with the “Invite members” modal open. The username/email field has been filled with “vinta,” and I clicked the suggestion for “Vinta Chen.” In the accessibility tree, I can see an option chip “Vinta Chen” present in the listbox, indicating the user has been added to the invite list. The role combobox is already set to “Guest,” which satisfies the requirement. The next step to complete the invite is to click the “Invite” button in the modal.
