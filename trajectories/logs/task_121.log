The user asks for reasons customers like the Circe hooded fleece. I’m on the Edit Review page for “Circe Hooded Ice Fleece,” showing a full customer review. I should extract explicit positive points from the visible review text. The review praises: “incredibly soft and cozy” fleece, “the addition of the hood for extra warmth,” “fit is true to size,” “sleeves are long enough,” and it being a “warm and comfortable layer for outdoor activities.” These are concrete reasons reflecting customer appreciation. I will now relay these reasons succinctly as a bullet list.
