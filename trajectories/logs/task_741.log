On the current OpenStreetMap directions panel, I see two textboxes: "From" (bid 194) and "To" (bid 199), with routing mode set to Car and service OSRM. The correct workflow is to enter the origin and destination, then trigger route calculation (often by pressing Enter in one of the fields). To proceed step-by-step within the constraint of one action per step, I will first populate the "From" field with a precise origin: "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" to ensure the correct location is selected. Next steps will be to fill the "To" field with "TD Garden, Boston, MA" and then press Enter to compute the route.

The user asked for the way from Carnegie Mellon University to the home stadium of Boston’s NBA team. On the current OpenStreetMap directions page, the route is already computed in Car mode using OSRM. The “From” field shows Carnegie Mellon University with a full address including ZIP code (15213), and the “To” field shows TD Garden with a full address including ZIP code (02114). The directions table displays total distance (920km) and estimated time (11:35), along with detailed turn-by-turn steps.

Given that the route is already visible and complete, the best next action is to communicate the route summary and essential steps to the user, including the full destination address with ZIP code and the distance/time in the required formats. I will send a concise summary focusing on major highways and final city streets to reach TD Garden, ensuring the address format and units match the map task tips.

The user requests directions from Carnegie Mellon University to the home stadium of Boston’s NBA team. The current OpenStreetMap directions page already shows a computed route using OSRM in Car mode with:
- From: “Carnegie Mellon University, Zebina Way, North Oakland, Bellefield, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States”
- To: “TD Garden, 100 Legends Way, West End, Boston, MA 02114, United States”

The directions panel displays “Distance: 920km” and “Time: 11:35,” plus a detailed step-by-step route. Since the route is already computed and visible, the best next action is to present a concise summary to the user, including the full addresses with ZIP codes and the distance/time in the required formats, and a brief list of key steps that “show the way.” I will use send_msg_to_user to deliver this summary clearly, avoiding heavy formatting and ensuring compliance with the map task tips.
