The goal is to create a new public project named "AutoAGI" and then add "primer" as members. I’m on the "Create blank project" form where Public visibility is already selected, which aligns with the requirement. The next step is to set the Project name to "AutoAGI". This should also auto-update the Project slug to a lowercase variant (likely "autoagi"). After setting the name, I will verify or adjust the slug if needed and then click "Create project". Once created, I will navigate to the project’s Members page via Project information > Members and invite "primer". For now, I will fill the Project name field.

The user’s goal is to create a new public project named “AutoAGI” and then add “primer” as members. I’m on the “Create blank project” page with:
- Project name = AutoAGI
- Project slug = autoagi
- Visibility = Public (already selected)
- Namespace button [284] currently shows “x-lab”
There is an error banner from a previous submission indicating the name/slug were already taken, likely in the previously selected namespace. I just interacted with the namespace selector and selected “x-lab”. To see whether this resolves the conflict, I should now attempt to create the project again. The next logical step is to click the “Create project” button. If the same error persists, I will then change the namespace (e.g., to the user’s “byteblaze” namespace) and resubmit. For now, I will submit by clicking the “Create project” button [358].

The user’s goal is to add “primer” as a member to the newly created public project “AutoAGI.” I’m currently on the project’s Activity page, which doesn’t expose the Members management interface. I attempted to navigate via the sidebar “Project information” (and its expand arrow), but the page did not change or reveal the “Members” sub-item based on the earlier actions and the current accessibility tree, which still shows we’re on the Activity page.

Given the repeated clicks didn’t navigate, the most reliable next step is to go directly to the Members page via its known GitLab path.

The goal is to add the user "primer" as a member of the newly created public project "AutoAGI." I am on the Members page with the "Invite members" modal open. The "Username or email address" field is already filled with "primer," and an autosuggest dropdown shows a selectable user "Primer primer" as a menu item [882]. To ensure the system recognizes the correct user account rather than treating the input as plain text, I should select the suggested user from the dropdown.

The user’s goal was to create a new public project named “AutoAGI” and add “primer” as members. I navigated through the GitLab UI to create a blank project named “AutoAGI” with Public visibility under the x-lab namespace (after resolving a namespace conflict), then went to Project information > Members and used the “Invite members” dialog to add “Primer (@primer)” with the default role “Guest”. The current Members page confirms success: a banner “Members were successfully added” is visible, the Members tab shows “2”, and the table lists both “Byte Blaze” and “Primer @primer” with role “Guest”. Therefore, the task is complete. I will now confirm completion to the user and offer to adjust the role if needed.
