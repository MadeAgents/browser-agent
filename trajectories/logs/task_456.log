The user wants to disable the product "Cora Pant" due to quality issues. In Magento, product status is managed in the Catalog > Products section, where we can search for the product, open its edit page, and set its status to Disabled (often via an "Enable Product" toggle set to No). From the current Dashboard page, the logical first step is to navigate to the Catalog section to access the products list. I will click the "CATALOG" menu item (bid 189) to go to the products grid, where I can search for "Cora Pant" next.
