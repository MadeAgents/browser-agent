The user wants me to create a new post in the "technology" forum about "what could open-source LLMs help the corresponding field." I’m on the Postmill home page and logged in (username visible). To create a submission, I should use the "Submit" link in the top navigation (bid 63). The tips indicate when creating a post, all content should go in the Body field and the URL field should be left empty, and to use exact text formatting from the task. Since the task doesn’t provide a separate title, a safe approach is to use the same exact phrase as both title and body or at least ensure the body contains the exact provided text. Next step: click the Submit link to open the submission form where I can select the forum (technology), enter title/body, and submit.

The user wants me to post in the technology forum about "what could open-source LLMs help the corresponding field." I'm already on the "Create submission" page. The form shows:
- URL vs Image radio buttons (URL selected), a URL textbox (should remain empty per instructions),
- Title (required),
- Body (Markdown allowed),
- Forum combobox (currently "Choose one…"),
- Create submission button.

Per the task tips, all content should go in the Body and URL left empty, and exact text formatting from the task should be used. Since Title is required, I will also use the exact provided text as the Title to ensure compliance. The next logical step is to fill the Title field with the exact text: "what could open-source LLMs help the corresponding field." After that, I’ll fill the Body with the same text, select the "technology" forum in the combobox, and submit.

For now, I'll perform the next single action: fill the Title field.
