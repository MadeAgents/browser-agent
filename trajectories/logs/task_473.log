The task is to cancel order 301. From the Dashboard page, the most direct way to find and manage orders is through the Sales section. The top horizontal navigation bar includes a "SALES" link (bid 156).

✅ Current Progress:
- Navigated to Sales > Orders page.
- Current list is filtered to order ID 000000307; the displayed order shows Status “Canceled.”
- Target order 301 has not been located or canceled yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path for canceling an order.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - “Active filters: ID: 000000307” list with remove button [854] — visible/enabled.
  - “Clear all” button [857] — visible/enabled; clears current filters.
  - “Filters” button [845] — visible/enabled; opens filter controls.
  - “Search by keyword” textbox [840] — visible; currently empty.
  - “Search” button [841] — visible/enabled.
  - Orders table shows a single row for ID “000000307” [1414] with Status “Canceled” (not the target 301).
- The current filter targets the wrong order (307), so the agent is off-track relative to the goal of canceling order 301.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
1) Click “Clear all” button [857] (or click the remove filter button [854]) to remove the ID: 000000307 filter.
2) Type “000000301” into the “Search by keyword” textbox [840] and click the “Search” button [841] to locate order 301.

The goal is to cancel order 301. The Orders page is currently filtered to ID 000000307, which shows a canceled status and is not the target. With the active filter set to 307, using the search box to find 301 would likely yield no results because the filter would still constrain the list to 307.

The goal is to cancel order #000000301. I previously clicked the "Cancel" button on the order detail page, which triggered a confirmation dialog. The current page shows a modal dialog asking, "Are you sure you want to cancel this order?" with two buttons: "Cancel" and "OK" (OK is focused). To complete the cancellation, I need to confirm by clicking "OK". This should update the order status from "Pending" to "Canceled".
