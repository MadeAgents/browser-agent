The user wants me to post a question asking for running shoe recommendations within a $500 budget in r/sports. To create a submission, I first need to navigate to the correct forum. From the current homepage, I see a top navigation with a "Forums" link (bid 42). Clicking that should take me to the forums listing page where I can find the 'sports' forum (as per the tip, likely via an alphabetical tab or search). Once in the sports forum, I'll use the Submit button there to create the post with the exact required content. The immediate next step is to click "Forums".

The goal is to post a question in the sports forum asking for running shoe recommendations under $500. I’m on the List of forums page and have already filled the searchbox with “sports” (bid 50). To actually filter or navigate to the sports forum, I need to execute the search. Since there’s no visible search button, the standard way is to press Enter while the searchbox is focused. This should display or navigate to the relevant forum, after which I can click into the sports forum and use its Submit button to create the post. The next best single action is to press Enter on the search field to run the search.

✅ Current Progress: Performed a site-wide search for “sports” and are logged in (user menu “MarvelsGrantMan136” visible). No post has been created, and the r/sports forum page has not been reached yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is a general Search results page (“50 results for sports:”) and not the r/sports forum. This is off the critical path for posting in r/sports. Relevant interactive elements:
- link “Forums” (id: [36]) — visible; suitable to navigate to the forums list.
- searchbox “Search query” (id: [112]) — visible, filled with “sports”.
- button “Search” (id: [115]) — visible, enabled; re-runs site-wide search, not targeted to forums.
- link “Submit” (id: [56]) — visible; would create a general submission, not necessarily in r/sports.
No direct link to the r/sports forum is visible in these search results.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link “Forums” (id: [36]) to navigate to the forums list, then locate and enter the “sports” forum to submit your post there.

The user’s goal is to create a post in r/sports asking for running shoe recommendations within a $500 budget. I’m currently on the “Create submission” page for the sports forum, with the forum combobox already set to “sports.” Following the site-specific tips: leave the URL field empty and put all content in the Body; ensure the title is filled since it’s required. To proceed, I need to enter the post content. Given the instruction to use exact text formatting from the task request, I will use the exact phrasing for the title first, then fill the body, and finally submit. The immediate next step is to fill the Title field (bid 138) with the exact wording: “Ask for product recommendations for running shoes within a budget of $500”.
