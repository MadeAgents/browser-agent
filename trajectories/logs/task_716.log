The user wants me to downvote (thumbs down) the top 3 posts ever in the "books" forum. Currently I'm on the home/subscribed feed, not specifically within the "books" forum. The right sidebar shows a "Subscribed forums" list with a link to "books" (bid 1207). To find the top posts ever, I need to navigate to the "books" forum first; once there, I should look for sorting controls (likely a "Sort by" button) and possibly a time range filter to select "Top" and "All time"/"Ever". Then, I will identify the top three posts on that page and click their Downvote buttons.

The best next step is to click the "books" link in the sidebar to navigate to the forum page, as this is necessary before sorting and downvoting within that specific forum. I should avoid scrolling as instructed, and not use external search. So I will click the "books" link (bid 1207).

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the /f/books forum page; posts are visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is relevant to the goal, but the listing is currently sorted by “Hot,” not “Top (ever),” which is required to identify the all-time top 3 posts before downvoting. Relevant interactive elements:
- [128] button “Sort by: Hot” (hasPopup=menu, expanded=False, visible/enabled).
- First three visible posts each show voting controls:
  - Top post: [173] “Retract upvote” and [183] “Downvote” (visible).
  - Second post: [215] “Retract upvote” and [225] “Downvote” (visible).
  - Third post: [257] “Retract upvote” and [267] “Downvote” (visible).
These downvote buttons are ready but should be used only after switching to “Top” (all-time) to target the correct items.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the sorting control [128] button labeled “Sort by: Hot” to open the menu and switch to “Top” (all time) so the correct top 3 posts are displayed.

The user requested to downvote (thumbs down) the top 3 posts ever in the books forum. I have already set the sorting to Top with the time range All time (URL shows /f/books/top?t=all). The first two posts have been downvoted successfully, as indicated by their buttons showing "Retract downvote" ([196] and [233]). The third post in the list ("Appalachian prison book project seeks notebook donations...") still has an available "Downvote" button [271]. To complete the task, I should click the Downvote button for this third post.
