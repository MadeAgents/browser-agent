✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the My Account dashboard. No order page has been opened yet and no address change has been made.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path to changing the delivery address for the most recent order. Relevant interactive elements:
- “Recent Orders” section: Contains rows of past orders with an “Action” column featuring links labeled “View Order” (visible and clickable). Use the most recent row by date.
- Address Book section:
  - Link “Manage Addresses” [1483] (visible, clickable) — edits address book defaults, not a specific order’s delivery address.
  - Link “Edit Address” under Default Shipping Address [1512] (visible, clickable) — also edits default shipping address, not the address tied to an existing order.

The goal is to change the delivery address for the most recent order. I am currently on the My Account dashboard, which includes a "Recent Orders" table with multiple orders listed. The most recent appears to be the top row, order #000000200 dated 12/18/25, with a "View Order" link in the Action column. To change the delivery address, I need to access the order details page, where options to edit shipping information are typically available for pending orders.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path for changing the delivery address, but it shows the order details without any visible controls to edit shipping information.
- Page status: “Pending” is shown, indicating the order hasn’t shipped yet.
- Relevant elements:
  - Heading “Order # 000000200” [1452] (visible).
  - Link “Reorder” [1460] (visible, enabled).
  - Link “Print Order” [1462] (visible, enabled).
  - Shipping Address block (static text, not editable):
    - Name/address lines (markers around 1551–1553): “Emma Lopez”, “222 Redwood Rise Suite 300”, “Seattle, Washington, 98101, United States” (all static text; no input fields or edit links).
  - Shipping Method: “Flat Rate - Fixed” (static text).
  - Billing Address and Payment Method sections: static text (no edit controls).
- No “Edit”/“Change Shipping Address” button or link is present on this order page, so the address cannot be modified from the current view.

The user wants to change the delivery address for their most recent order.

On this page, the Shipping Address section is static text and there are no visible controls to edit it—only “Reorder” and “Print Order” links. Since I don’t see an edit option on the order view, the next best step is to navigate to the “My Orders” list via the left navigation. Sometimes Magento exposes actions like “Edit” or “Change Address” from the orders list, especially for pending orders. I will click “My Orders” to check if there’s an available edit function for this order.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is on the critical path toward changing the delivery address, as it lists orders and provides access to their details.

  - Order Total [1472]: “$528.34”
  - Status [1474]: “Pending”

- No “Edit/Change Address” control is present on this listing page; any modification options, if available, would likely be within the order detail view accessed via “View Order.”

The user wants to change the delivery address for the most recent order. I’m on the order details page for Order #000000200, which is indeed the most recent (Order Date: December 18, 2025) and currently “Pending.” I carefully reviewed the page’s accessible elements:

- Main actions available: “Reorder” and “Print Order.”
- The “Shipping Address” and “Billing Address” sections are displayed as static text with no editable fields or buttons.
- The sidebar provides navigation links like “My Orders” and “Address Book,” but from prior navigation and typical Magento storefront behavior, modifying the Address Book will not retroactively change the shipping address of an already-placed order.
- There is no “Edit,” “Change Address,” or similar control on the order detail view or indicated in the current UI.

Given these constraints, the site does not provide a way to directly change the shipping address on an existing order via the frontend UI. The most viable route would be to contact support (e.g., via “Contact Us”) to request the change. Since the task is to perform the change and the UI lacks the required functionality, the appropriate step is to notify the user that this is infeasible through the current interface and suggest contacting support to request the update.
