The user asks for the names of customers who have expressed dissatisfaction with “Chloe tank.” In Magento, customer reviews are managed under MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews (per the provided task tips). To identify dissatisfaction, I likely need to review the ratings/comments for the product "Chloe tank" (which may be “Chloe Compete Tank” in Luma sample data), and then extract the customer names from reviews that indicate negative sentiment (often low star ratings or explicitly negative text). 

Starting from the Dashboard, the most direct path is to open the MARKETING section, then navigate to All Reviews. From there, I can filter by product name "Chloe" to find relevant reviews and look for negative ones. The first step is to click the MARKETING tab in the top menubar to access the marketing options, including User Content > All Reviews. I’ll proceed with clicking the MARKETING menu link.

The user asks for the names of customers who expressed dissatisfaction with the Chloe tank. I’m on the Magento Admin Reviews page already filtered to Product “Chloe” (specifically “Chloe Compete Tank,” SKU WT06), showing 3 records.
