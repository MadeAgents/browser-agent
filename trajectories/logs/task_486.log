The user wants to change the page title for the "404 Not Found" CMS page. In Magento, CMS pages are managed under the Content section. From the Dashboard, I should navigate to CONTENT to reach the area where Pages are listed. Once there, I can find the "404 Not Found" page (likely identifier "no-route") and edit its title (likely the "Meta Title" or page title field). The first step is to click the "CONTENT" menu item on the left to access the Content management area.
