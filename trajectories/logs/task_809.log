- Project navigation link “Issues” [332] (visible, enabled) — needed to access the project’s issues and create a new one.
- Top navigation link “Issues” [183] (visible, enabled) — global issues; less relevant than the project-specific “Issues” [332].

- Textbox “Search GitLab” [146] (visible, empty) — not required for the task.
