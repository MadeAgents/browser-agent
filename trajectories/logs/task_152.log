The user asks for the minimum travel time by car from Schenley Park to Upitt (University of Pittsburgh). On OpenStreetMap, the most efficient way is to use the directions tool. The current page shows the OSM homepage with a search box and a link labeled "Find directions between two points" (bid 167) next to the Go button. According to the task tips, we should use the two-arrow button to open the route planner rather than trying to search each place separately. Clicking this should open the directions panel where I can enter “Schenley Park” as the origin and “University of Pittsburgh” (Upitt) as the destination, then select car mode and compute the route to find the minimum travel time. So the next step is to click the directions link to open the routing interface.

The user wants the minimum travel time by car from Schenley Park to Upitt (University of Pittsburgh). The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with Car mode selected and OSRM as the routing engine. The panel shows two textboxes: "From" [194] and "To" [199]. To compute the route, I should enter the origin and destination, then trigger the route calculation (typically by pressing Enter in one of the fields). Following best practice, I will first populate the "From" field with a precise location string to ensure it picks the Pittsburgh location, e.g., "Schenley Park, Pittsburgh, PA". After that, I will fill the "To" field with "University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA" and press Enter to get the route. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best action is to fill the "From" textbox.

No route results are shown yet, meaning the route calculation likely hasn't been triggered. On OSM, triggering the route is typically done by pressing Enter in one of the address fields. Given the "To" field [199] is focused, the most effective next step is to press Enter on that field to compute the route.
