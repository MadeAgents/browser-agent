The user’s goal is to add a Simple Product with specific attributes: Size S and Color blue, with stock 50 and price $60. On the New Product page, the essential fields have already been filled: Product Name is "Energy-Bulk Women Shirt", Price is "60", Quantity is "50", and the product is In Stock. The remaining step is to set the attributes Size and Color. In Magento, these are typically inside the "Attributes" accordion section, which is currently collapsed as indicated by the "Attributes" label [1705]. To proceed, I need to expand this section to access and set Size and Color values. Therefore, the best next action is to click the "Attributes" section header to expand it.

Next, I should set the Color to “Blue.” Using select_option is appropriate for combobox/select elements. After that, I will set the Size to “S,” and then click Save to complete the product creation.

The user’s goal is to add a Simple Product named “Energy-Bulk Women Shirt” with quantity 50, size S, color blue, and price $60. We are on the New Product form for a Simple Product in Magento Admin. The required fields are already filled:
- Product Name [946]: “Energy-Bulk Women Shirt”
- Price [963]: “60”
- Quantity [987]: “50”
- Stock Status [997]: “In Stock”
- Color [2324]: “Blue”
- Size [2343]: “S”

Previously, a save attempt produced a URL Key conflict. I expanded the Search Engine Optimization section [1526] and updated the URL Key [2387] to a unique value: “energy-bulk-women-shirt-blue-s,” which should resolve the conflict with “energy-bulk-women-shirt.html.” With all required details set per the user’s instructions and the URL key updated, the next best step is to save the product. The Save button [854] is visible and enabled, so I will click it to create the product.

The user asked to add a simple product with specified details. Reviewing the current page, we are on the Magento Admin product edit page for “Energy-Bulk Women Shirt,” and system messages indicate: “You saved the product.” and “SKU for product Energy-Bulk Women Shirt has been changed to Energy-Bulk Women Shirt-1.” The fields show Price 60.00, Quantity 50, and Stock Status In Stock. Previously, I had set Size to S and Color to Blue. No further configuration is required for the user’s request. The best next step is to inform the user that the product has been successfully created with the requested specs, including the auto-adjusted SKU, rather than taking further actions on the page. Therefore, I will send a confirmation message summarizing the completed setup.
