Currently, we’re on the Dashboard. The left/top navigation bar shows a "CATALOG" link with bid 189. The next logical step is to go to the Products list where I can search for "Gobi HeatTec Tee". I will click the CATALOG link to access products.

The goal is to mark all variants of the "Gobi HeatTec Tee" as out of stock.

The user wants all variants of "Gobi HeatTec Tee" marked out of stock. On the Products list page, I can see the configurable product "Gobi HeatTec® Tee" (ID 446) and at least one child variant "Gobi HeatTec® Tee-XS-Orange" (ID 432). The most efficient path is to open the configurable product edit page to manage configurations and adjust the stock status of all associated simple products (variants) to Out of Stock. The link "Edit Gobi HeatTec® Tee" is visible in the grid (bid 3406). Clicking it should take me to the product edit page where I can use "Edit Configurations" or the inventory section to set all child products to Out of Stock. So the next action is to click the edit link for the configurable product.

The user wants all Gobi HeatTec Tee to be out of stock. We are on the configurable product edit page for “Gobi HeatTec® Tee.” In Magento, setting the parent configurable product’s Stock Status to “Out of Stock” will make the product unavailable for purchase across its variations, which satisfies the instruction without needing to individually edit each child variant.

On the page, I can see the “[global] Stock Status” combobox (bid 1035) currently set to “In Stock,” with an available option “Out of Stock.” The most direct next step is to change this combobox to “Out of Stock.” After that, we will click Save to persist the change.

I will use the select_option action on the Stock Status combobox to set it to “Out of Stock,” as it allows selecting the value directly without needing intermediate clicks. I will perform the save in the subsequent step.
