The user wants me to create a folder named "moive_space" in the "gimmiethat.space" repository on GitLab, and then add a file "urls.txt" containing URLs of the 5 most recent posts from the "movies?" forum. I'm currently on the GitLab dashboard listing many projects; I can't scroll and don't immediately see "gimmiethat.space" in the visible list. According to the task tips, the global search bar is not working, and I should use the direct search URL format to find repositories. The best next step is to navigate to the GitLab search results for "gimmiethat.space" using the specified URL, which will help me quickly access the repo to start repository changes afterward. Once in the repo, I will create the directory and later gather URLs from the forum site; but for now, the immediate step is to open the repo via search.

  - Link “Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space” (axtree node [322]): visible and clickable; opens the repository.
  - Searchbox “Search for projects, issues, etc.” (node [231]): populated with “gimmiethat.space”.
  - Button “Search” (node [235]): visible and enabled.
  - Navigation link “Projects 1” (node [289]): shows there is one project result, consistent with the target repo.
  - Filter buttons “Group Any” (node [240]) and “Project Any” (node [263]): visible, not required for proceeding.
The current page is appropriate; the next critical action is to open the repository via the link [322].

The page shows the files list, so creating a new folder “moive_space” and then adding “urls.txt” within it can proceed from here using the new-item menu (node [619]).

The goal is to gather URLs of the 5 most recent posts from the "movies?" forum and then create a folder and file in the GitLab repo. I’m currently on the “All forums” page of the community forum site. The Accessibility Tree and screenshot show a link labeled “movies” with bid [263] under the “M” section. To get the latest posts, I should navigate into this forum first. Clicking the "movies" link is the next logical step to access the forum’s listing page, where I can identify the 5 most recent posts and collect their internal post URLs (using the "comments" links per the Reddit Task Tips) before returning to GitLab to create the folder and file.

I’m currently on the /f/movies forum page, and the list is sorted by “New” (button shows "Sort by: New"), so the top entries are the most recent posts.

I will start by opening the comments page for the first (most recent) post, which has a “No comments” link with bid 162. Once on that page, I can capture the URL and later repeat for the next four posts, then return to GitLab to create moive_space/urls.txt with these URLs.

- Required path to goal:
  1) Click “New” (node [137]) to sort by newest.
  2) For the top five posts, click each “comments” link to open the comments/permalink page and record its Short URL.
  3) Switch to the GitLab tab and create moive_space/urls.txt with those five URLs, then commit (creating the moive_space folder as part of the file path).

The user needs the URLs of the 5 most recent posts from the movies forum to populate a file in the GitLab repo. On the current /f/movies page, the list is sorted by “Hot,” which won’t give the most recent posts. The sort dropdown is already expanded (button “Sort by: Hot” is open), and I can see the “New” option (bid 137). Selecting “New” will reorder the posts by recency, enabling me to click the “comments” links of the top five posts to capture their permalinks. I’ve already collected one URL from a prior visit to a comments page, but after returning to the forum, the sort reverted to Hot; so I need to reapply “New” before proceeding to gather the remaining four URLs.

✅ Current Progress:
- Opened the gimmiethat.space GitLab repository (in another tab).
- Navigated to /f/movies and set sorting to “New.”
- Captured 2 Short URLs for the most recent posts: http://10.177.37.113:9999/128825 and http://10.177.37.113:9999/128824.
- Folder “moive_space” and file “urls.txt” have not been created yet; 3 more URLs still needed.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page (/f/movies) is on the critical path and correctly sorted by newest (“Sort by: New”).
- Relevant interactive elements to collect remaining URLs:
  - [128] button “Sort by: New” — visible, enabled, hasPopup, expanded=False.
  - “comments” permalinks for the top posts:
    - [162] link “No comments” (top post) — visible, enabled.
    - [200] link “No comments” (second post) — visible, enabled.
    - [244] link “No comments” (third post) — visible, enabled.
  - Clicking each “comments” link opens the post’s comments page where the Short URL is displayed; capture the next three Short URLs, then switch to the GitLab tab to create moive_space/urls.txt containing all five URLs.

The objective is to create a folder and file in the GitLab repo, but first I need to collect URLs of the 5 most recent posts from the movies forum.

The objective is to create a folder and file in the GitLab repo, but first I need to collect URLs of the 5 most recent posts from the movies forum. I’ve already captured 4 Short URLs by opening the “comments” permalinks for the first four posts when sorted by New. I’m currently on /f/movies/new (sorted by “New”), so the next step is to open the comments page for the fifth most recent post to get its Short URL. In the accessibility tree, the fifth article ("Ban on Fetish Sex Depictions in Film Should End, Australia Government Report Recommends") has its “No comments” link at bid 325. Clicking that will navigate to the comments/permalink page where I can capture the Short URL, completing the set of five. After that, I will switch back to GitLab to create moive_space/urls.txt and commit the five URLs.

- Opened the gimmiethat.space GitLab repository in another tab (folder “moive_space” and file “urls.txt” not yet created).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The current page is the comments/permalink for a movies forum post and is directly on the critical path to capture the 5th URL.
- Relevant element to extract the URL:
  - [327] heading “Short URL:” — visible.
  - [328] paragraph showing Short URL “http://10.177.37.113:9999/128821” — visible/enabled (copyable).
- Navigation back to the forum list is available if needed:
  - [120] link “/f/movies” — visible/enabled.
- After noting this 5th URL, proceed to the GitLab tab to create folder “moive_space” and add file “urls.txt” containing the 5 URLs.

  - [612] link “Browse files” — visible and enabled; will navigate to the repository file browser where new files/folders can be added.
  - [614] button “Options” (hasPopup, expanded=False) — visible; not needed for this task.
  - [299] link “Repository” in the sidebar — visible and enabled; can be used to navigate back to repository sections if needed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click link [612] “Browse files” to return to the repository Files view.
- If that does not navigate correctly, click sidebar link [299] “Repository” to access the repository sections, then proceed to the Files view to add “moive_space/urls.txt”.
