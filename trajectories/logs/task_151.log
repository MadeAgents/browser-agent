The user's goal is to find the minimum travel time by car from CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) to the University of Pittsburgh using the current OpenStreetMap website. On the page, I see the search bar and, importantly, a link labeled "Find directions between two points" with the two-arrow icon (bid 167). According to the task tips, to find routes from point A to B, it’s best to use this directions tool rather than just the general search. The logical first step is to click that directions link to open the directions panel where I can enter the starting and ending locations, then set the mode to car (which is often default) and get the route options to find the minimum travel time. Therefore, the next action should be to click on the "Find directions between two points" link.

The user asks for the minimum travel time by car from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to the University of Pittsburgh. We are on OpenStreetMap’s directions interface, already showing the directions panel with Car mode selected (radio [173] checked). The necessary inputs are the "From" textbox [194] and the "To" textbox [199]. To compute a car route, we should enter the start and end locations; typically, the system will propose suggestions—selecting the correct Pittsburgh entries is important. The environment tip also mentions using the ‘press’ step after entering both locations, but first we need to populate the "From" field.

Plan:
1) Fill the "From" field with “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” to disambiguate globally.
2) Then fill the "To" field with “University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA”.
3) Trigger route calculation (likely pressing Enter or selecting a suggestion).
4) Read the route list/times and report the minimum travel time.

The next best single action is to fill the From field (bid 194) with the full CMU string to ensure accurate geocoding.
