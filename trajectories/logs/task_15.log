The user wants the total number of store reviews that include the term "best". According to the provided task tips, all reviews can be accessed via MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews, and there are usually filters to search within review content. Starting from the Dashboard, I should navigate to MARKETING to reach the reviews section. The next logical step is to click the MARKETING menu item in the top navigation to proceed towards User Content > All Reviews, where I can then filter by the term "best" in the review content/detail column and count the results. Since only one action is allowed per step, I will first click MARKETING.

The user wants the total number of reviews across the whole store that contain the term "best". From the dashboard, the Marketing flyout menu is already open, and within it under "User Content" I can access "All Reviews". According to the task tips, to find all reviews and their counts, I should go to MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews. Once on that page, I can use the grid’s filter (likely on the review content/detail column) to search for the term "best" and then read the total number of matching records (often displayed as "X records found"). The next immediate step is to navigate to the All Reviews page by clicking the "All Reviews" link in the open Marketing menu.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is directly on the critical path to the goal (finding how many reviews mention “best”). The grid includes a filter row where we can search review content.
- Button 'Search' (id=700): visible/enabled — executes the grid filters.
- Button 'Reset Filter' (id=703): visible/enabled — clears filters.
- Columnheader 'Review' (id=781) with filter textbox in its row: visible (textbox appears empty in the screenshot), relevant for entering the term “best”.
- Status filter combobox in filter row (value='Any', id=796): visible/enabled — not required for this query unless narrowing by status.
- “351 records found” indicator: visible — confirms current unfiltered count.
- Pagination controls (e.g., per-page combobox id=749, page input id=759): visible — not required for counting after filtering.

The user needs the total count of reviews that mention the term "best". I am already on the Reviews (All Reviews) grid in Magento Admin, which shows 351 records unfiltered. To find reviews that mention "best", I should use the filter row within the grid. The filter row includes separate textboxes for Title, Nickname, and Review content. Based on the accessibility tree order: 
- [821] is the Title textbox, 
- [823] is the Nickname textbox, 
- [825] is the Review content textbox. 
I will enter "best" into the Review content filter textbox [825]. After that, I will need to click the Search button [700] to apply the filter and read the updated "records found" count. Since only one action is allowed at a time, the next step is to fill the "best" term into the Review content filter field.
