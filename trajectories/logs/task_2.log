The user asks for the top-1 best-selling product type in Quarter 1 2022. To find this, I should use the Magento Admin's reporting features. The Dashboard shows a "Bestsellers" widget, but it doesn't allow date range filtering, and it lists product names rather than aggregating by type. The Task Tips suggest using the REPORTS tab to generate reports and that when asked for product type, I should return the type rather than the product name. Therefore, I need to navigate to REPORTS where I can select a product-related report (likely "Products Ordered" or "Bestsellers") and set the date range to Q1 2022 (01/01/2022 to 03/31/2022). The first step is to click the REPORTS link in the top navigation.

The user asks: "What is the top-1 best-selling product type in Quarter 1 2022". 
To answer, I need a report of best-selling products filtered to Q1 2022 (01/01/2022 to 03/31/2022). The Reports menu overlay is already open on the Dashboard with sections including "Products" where "Bestsellers" and "Ordered" links exist. The most appropriate is "Bestsellers" since it likely ranks products by quantity sold for a specified date range. After opening that, I expect a page with date filters (From/To) and a "Show Report" button. I will set From 01/01/2022 and To 03/31/2022, then show the report. Once the list of products is shown along with quantities, I'll identify the top-1 and then interpret the "product type" from the product name. If needed, I may have to open the product to confirm its type/category, but often the name is sufficient (e.g., "Sprite Stasis Ball 65 cm" => type "ball"; "Overnight Duffle" => type "bag"). First step: click the "Bestsellers" link in the Reports overlay.

The user asks for the top-1 best-selling product type in Q1 2022. I’m currently on the Bestsellers Report page with the date range set from 1/1/22 to 3/31/22 and results populated (33 records). However, the Bestsellers report groups by Interval (currently Day) and lists individual products with quantities, which makes it cumbersome to deduce the top product type across the entire quarter.

A better approach is to use the Reports > Products > Ordered report, which aggregates quantities by product over a specified date range. From there, I can identify the top product by quantity and infer its product type (e.g., tee, hoodie, watch). To navigate there, I need to open the REPORTS menu (left sidebar) and then choose the appropriate sub-report.

The user needs the top-1 best-selling product type in Q1 2022. The current page is Reports > Products > Bestsellers with the date range already set to 1/1/22–3/31/22, and it shows many individual sales entries grouped by day. However, this view does not aggregate totals by product across the entire quarter and certainly not by product type, making it cumbersome to deduce the overall best-selling type.

A more suitable report is Reports > Products > Ordered, which aggregates quantities by product over a specified date range. From that report, I can quickly identify the top products by total ordered quantity for Q1 2022 and then infer their “product type” (e.g., tee, hoodie, watch) per the benchmark’s guidance to return the type, not the product name. The Reports overlay is already open, and I can directly click the “Ordered” link to navigate there.

Objective: Determine the top-1 best-selling product type in Q1 2022.

Current page: Reports > Products > Ordered Products Report. The "From" date is set to 01/01/2022 and the "To" date is set to 03/31/2022. "Show By" is currently "Day". The table shows "We can't find records for this period." likely because the report has not been refreshed after setting the dates.

Plan:
1) Click "Refresh" to generate the report for the specified date range.
2) If the results show per-day rows, I can later change "Show By" to "Year" to aggregate totals across the selected period and refresh again, making it easier to identify the top product. 
3) Identify the top-1 product by ordered quantity and infer the product type (per instruction 17, return the type, not the product name).

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to determine the top-1 best-selling product type for Q1 2022.

- [745] combobox “Show By:” — value “Day” (options: Day/Month/Year), enabled, not expanded. Currently groups results by day, which fragments totals across the quarter.
- [749] button “Refresh” — enabled, visible.
- [762] results table — visible with columns [765] Interval, [767] Product, [769] SKU, [771] Ordered Quantity; many rows now present for Q1 but split by daily intervals.
- [708] button “Scope: All Websites” — enabled (menu), currently “All Websites”.
- [755] combobox “Export to:” — value “CSV”, enabled; [758] button “Export” — enabled.
Interpretation: To accurately identify the single top product across Q1 (and then infer its “product type”), the data should be aggregated over the full range. Changing “Show By” from Day to Year (or Month) and clicking Refresh will consolidate quantities per product within the selected dates, making it straightforward to pick the top-1 and derive its product type from the product name.

The user asks for the top-1 best-selling product type in Q1 2022. I navigated to Reports > Products > Ordered Products Report and set the date range From 01/01/2022 to 03/31/2022. I changed “Show By” to “Year” to aggregate over the selected period and refreshed the report. The table shows Interval “2022” with ordered quantities per product for Q1. The highest ordered quantity is 3, and two products share this top quantity: “Quest Lumaflex™ Band” (3) and “Dash Digital Watch” (3). Translating product names to product types per the instruction to return type (not product name), these map to “band” and “watch.” Since there is a tie for the highest quantity, both “band” and “watch” are top types. To provide a single top-1 type while acknowledging the tie, I will state “watch” and note the tie.
