The task requires finding the latest post in the Showerthoughts forum, identifying its author, then going to that user's profile to count comments with more downvotes than upvotes. I’m currently on the "List of forums" page and can see the Showerthoughts forum entry with a clickable link labeled "Showerthoughts — Showerthoughts" (bid 404). The next logical step is to open the Showerthoughts forum page to view its posts and determine the latest one. Per the task tips, to access posts within a forum, I should click the forum link first. Once on the forum page, I will look for the most recent submission, capture the author's username, and then navigate to their profile to examine their comments and tally those with more downvotes than upvotes. Therefore, the immediate action is to click the Showerthoughts forum link.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward the goal, showing the Showerthoughts forum’s submissions list. However, it is currently sorted by “Hot,” not by recency, so the “latest post” is not guaranteed to be at the top.
- Button “Sort by: Hot” (id=128), hasPopup=menu, expanded=False — visible/enabled; needed to switch to a recency sort (e.g., “New”) to find the latest post.
- Tab links in forum header:
  - “Submissions” (id=123) — visible/clickable; currently on submissions.
  - “Comments” (id=125) — visible/clickable.
- Top listed post entry (not necessarily latest due to Hot sort):
  - Post title link “A rock might have spent over 260 million years…” (id=152) — visible/clickable.
  - “Submitted by” user link “Waoonet” (id=155) — visible/clickable; leads to the author’s profile.
  - “85 comments” link (id=162) — visible/clickable.
  - Voting buttons: “Upvote” (id=168) and “Downvote” (id=178) — visible/enabled.
- Additional posts below follow the same structure, each with a heading link, a “Submitted by” user link, and a comments link.
