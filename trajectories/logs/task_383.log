The user wants information around Pittsburgh International Airport. On OpenStreetMap, the most efficient way is to use the Search bar rather than panning/scrolling. The search field is already focused (node 162). I should first search for “Pittsburgh International Airport” to get the map centered there. After that, I can identify a nearby Hyatt hotel (likely “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport”) and then find supermarkets within a 15-minute drive by checking nearby supermarkets and using the directions tool to calculate driving time from the hotel to each supermarket.

Step 1: Use the search bar to locate Pittsburgh International Airport. This will set the context around the airport. The next step will be to either search for “Hyatt” near that location or visually identify the Hyatt hotel pin. For now, the immediate action is to fill the search field with “Pittsburgh International Airport” and press Go.

I will fill the search box and then click Go in subsequent steps. For this single action, I’ll enter the query text.

The user’s goal has two parts:
1) Provide the name of a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport.
2) Provide the names of supermarkets within 15 minutes driving from that hotel.

We’re on OpenStreetMap with the Directions panel open. The “From” field is already set to “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport, 1111, Airport Boulevard, Findlay Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 15231, United States,” confirming the Hyatt hotel name. The “To” field is filled with “supermarket” and is focused. To get driving times, I need to trigger the routing engine. In OSM’s directions interface, pressing Enter in the destination field typically runs the route search (or selects a likely result). The interface doesn’t show a dedicated “Go/Press” button in the accessibility tree, so pressing Enter on the focused “To” field is the best next step to compute a route to a nearby supermarket. Once the route is computed, I can read the drive time and, if possible, iterate across nearby supermarkets to list those within 15 minutes. First, I need to execute the search by pressing Enter in the “To” field.

✅ Current Progress:
- Identified nearby Hyatt: “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport.”
- Opened Directions in driving mode and set the hotel as the origin.
- Attempted to find supermarkets, but routing failed due to an incorrect destination match.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- We are on the correct tool (OpenStreetMap Directions) for measuring drive times from the hotel.

  - Textbox “From” [194] — filled with “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport, 1111 Airport Boulevard, … PA 15231, United States”, visible/enabled.
  - Textbox “To” [199] — currently “Supermarket, Monrovia, Greater Monrovia, Montserrado County, Liberia”, focused; this is incorrect and far from Pittsburgh.
  - Static text error: “Couldn't find a route between those two places.” — indicates the current destination is off-target.
- The page is on the critical path, but the current destination entry is unrelated to the goal area (Pittsburgh).

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Clear the “To” field [199], then type: “supermarket near Pittsburgh International Airport PA” and press Enter on the same field [199] to get nearby results and compute drive times.
- If the results are still broad, refine by entering: “supermarket near 1111 Airport Boulevard, Findlay Township, PA 15231” in the “To” field [199], then press Enter.

The user wants the Hyatt hotel name near Pittsburgh Airport and the names of supermarkets within 15 minutes' drive from that hotel. The current OpenStreetMap Directions panel shows:
- Car mode selected.
- From field [194] already set to “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport, 1111 Airport Boulevard, Findlay Township, PA 15231, United States” — this confirms the Hyatt hotel name.
- To field [199] incorrectly set to “Supermarket, Monrovia, … Liberia,” which caused a routing error.

I need to correct the destination to a nearby supermarket around PIT and then compute the driving time. A practical approach is to route to known nearby supermarkets one by one and check if the driving time is ≤15 minutes. A reliable, well-known nearby candidate is “Walmart Supercenter” in Moon Township on University Blvd (very close to the airport). I’ll first overwrite the To field with “Walmart Supercenter Moon Township, PA”. After that, in a following step, I will press Enter to compute the route and read the drive time. If it’s within 15 minutes, I’ll record it and proceed to test additional supermarkets (e.g., Giant Eagle Market District at Settlers Ridge, Trader Joe’s Robinson) in subsequent steps.

Immediate next action: fill the To field with the Moon Township Walmart to get a relevant local result.

The user wants the Hyatt hotel name near PIT and supermarkets within 15 minutes’ drive from that hotel. The Directions panel confirms the origin as “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport, 1111 Airport Boulevard, Findlay Township, PA 15231, United States,” so the Hyatt name is known. We have tested routes to Walmart Supercenter (Moon Township), Giant Eagle (Moon Township), and ALDI (Robinson Township), each showing 0:16 (16 minutes), exceeding the 15-minute threshold.

To find qualifying supermarkets, I should try a closer option. “Shop 'n Save” in Coraopolis/Moon Township is likely nearer to the airport (Beaver Grade Rd/Thorn Run vicinity). The To field [199] is focused, currently set to ALDI Robinson Township. The next step is to change the destination to “Shop 'n Save Coraopolis, PA”; after that, I will press Enter to compute the route and check the time. Since only one action is allowed per step, I will first fill the To field with this new query.

Goal: Provide the name of a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport and list supermarkets within 15 minutes’ drive from that hotel. We’re using OpenStreetMap’s Directions tool. The current page already shows:
- From: Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport (this confirms the Hyatt hotel name).
- To: Shop n Save Coraopolis, PA, with a computed drive time of 0:16 (16 minutes), which exceeds the 15-minute threshold.

We need to test other supermarkets to find any with a drive time of 0:15 or less. Prior attempts and times:
- Walmart Supercenter (Moon Township): 16 min
- Giant Eagle (Moon Township): 16 min
- ALDI (Robinson Township): 16 min
- Shop n Save (Coraopolis, PA): 16 min

To find a qualifying supermarket, I should try another nearby option likely closer. Kuhn’s Market in Moon Township (on/near Beaver Grade Road) is a known local supermarket and could be closer than the others. The “To” textbox [199] is focused. I will overwrite it with “Kuhn’s Market Moon Township, PA” and then in the next step I’ll press Enter to compute routing and see if the time is within 15 minutes.

This is the most informative next step because it directly tests another plausible nearby supermarket that may meet the time constraint.

The user wants: 
1) The name of a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport, and 
2) Names of supermarkets within 15 minutes’ drive from that hotel.

We’re already on OpenStreetMap’s Directions page with:
- From: Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport (confirming the Hyatt name).
- To: Kuhn’s Market Moon Township, PA.
The interface shows a computed route summary: Distance 12km, Time 0:16 (16 minutes), which is over the 15-minute threshold. We have tested several supermarkets (Walmart Supercenter, Giant Eagle, ALDI, Shop ’n Save, Kuhn’s Market) and each was 16 minutes via OSRM.

Before concluding there are none within 15 minutes, I should try a different routing engine (Valhalla or GraphHopper) to see if the estimated time changes to 15 minutes for some destinations. The Directions services combobox [182] is currently on “OSRM.” I can switch it to “Valhalla,” which should immediately recompute the route for the current destination and may produce a slightly different time estimate. This is a single, efficient step that could potentially yield a qualifying supermarket without needing to re-enter destinations.

Therefore, the next best action is to change the Directions service to Valhalla using the combobox.

The user wants to know:
1) If there's a Hyatt near Pittsburgh International Airport and its name.
2) The names of supermarkets within 15 minutes’ drive from that hotel.

We are on OpenStreetMap with the Directions panel open. The “From” field is set to “Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport, 1111 Airport Boulevard, Findlay Township, PA 15231, United States,” confirming the Hyatt nearby. I then tested multiple supermarkets as “To” destinations from this hotel using the car routing mode:
- Walmart Supercenter (Moon Township) — 16 minutes (OSRM)
- Giant Eagle (Moon Township) — 16 minutes (OSRM)
- ALDI (Robinson Township) — 16 minutes (OSRM)
- Shop 'n Save (Coraopolis) — 16 minutes (OSRM)
- Kuhn’s Market (Moon Township) — 16 minutes (OSRM), 19 minutes (Valhalla)

All tested options exceeded 15 minutes. Given multiple engines produce >=16 minutes and the proximity context, it’s reasonable to conclude there are no supermarkets within a 15-minute drive from the Hyatt. The best next step is to report the findings clearly to the user, including a yes/no for the Hyatt nearby and listing closest supermarket names (without times since the user only asked for names within 15 mins; also stating that none fall within 15 minutes).

I will send a concise message:
- Yes, there is a nearby Hyatt: Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport.
- Supermarkets within 15 minutes: No. Closest options (about 16 minutes) are Walmart Supercenter (Moon Township), Giant Eagle (Moon Township), ALDI (Robinson Township), Shop 'n Save (Coraopolis), Kuhn’s Market (Moon Township).

This directly answers the question and relies on the routing results we computed.
