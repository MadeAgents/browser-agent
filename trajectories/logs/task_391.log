The user wants me to post a specific comment on a merge request in the project "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com". I’m currently on the Projects dashboard where this project appears at the top. The best path is to first navigate into the project page by clicking its link, then access its Merge Requests tab, locate the merge request related to "focus edge cases", open it, and add a comment "close because non reproducible". 

Given the current page, the immediate next step is to click into the project. In the accessibility tree and screenshot, the project link is identified as [320] "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com". I will click that to enter the project where I can then look for the Merge Requests tab and the specific MR.

The user’s goal is to post a specific comment on a merge request related to “focus edge cases” within the a11yproject/a11yproject.com repository. I’m currently on the project’s main page. To find the correct merge request efficiently, I should navigate to the project-specific Merge requests tab in the left sidebar (as using the global Merge requests at the top could show all MRs across projects, which is not ideal per the benchmark tips). The accessibility tree shows a “Merge requests” link in the project navigation with id [352]. Clicking this should take me to the list of MRs for this project, where I can search for or identify the MR titled or described with “focus edge cases”, open it, and then add a comment. First step: click the project’s Merge requests tab.
