The user wants me to edit their post titled "Nvidia RTX 4090" and add a specific line to the body. On the current homepage, I can see the "Nvidia RTX 4090" article with an "Edit" link within its navigation section. To modify the body, I need to access the edit form for this specific post. The correct next step is to click the "Edit" link associated with the "Nvidia RTX 4090" article (bid 573) to open the edit page where I can then append the requested line to the body field.

The user wants to append a specific line to the body of their existing post titled "Nvidia RTX 4090". I’m already on the edit page for this submission. In the accessibility tree and screenshot, I can see:
- The Body textbox (bid 126) currently contains "Crazy device for ML!".
- There is an "Edit submission" button (bid 267) to save changes.

The correct next step is to modify the Body field to include the new line while preserving the existing text. I will fill the Body textbox with the original text plus a newline and the exact requested line: "EDIT: This news aged well". After this, I will need to submit the form, but since only one action is allowed per step, I will first perform the fill.

```fill("126", "Crazy device for ML!\nEDIT: This news aged well")```

The user’s goal is to add a line to their post’s body that says "EDIT: This news aged well". I’m on the edit page for the submission titled "Nvidia RTX 4090". From the accessibility tree, the Body textbox (bid 126) already contains "Crazy device for ML!\nEDIT: This news aged well" and the Preview reflects this, so the text insertion step is complete. To finalize the edit, I need to save the changes by clicking the "Edit submission" button (bid 267). No other required fields are missing (Title is present, URL can remain empty), so the next best action is to submit the form.
