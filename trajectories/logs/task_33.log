The user needs a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh Airport and then the shortest walking distance to a supermarket from that hotel. I'm on OpenStreetMap with the search box focused. The map is currently centered over Hong Kong, so I need to search for Pittsburgh International Airport first to move the map to the relevant area. Using the site's search bar is the most efficient approach per the tips. I'll enter "Pittsburgh International Airport" into the Search textbox so that I can then click Go in the following step to navigate to that location.

The user wants a Hilton-brand hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport and then the shortest walking distance from that hotel to a supermarket. I’m on the OpenStreetMap search results centered around the airport. The fastest way to find a Hilton hotel is to use the search bar rather than panning/scrolling. Known nearby Hilton options include "Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport," "DoubleTree by Hilton Pittsburgh Airport," and "Hampton Inn Pittsburgh Airport" (a Hilton brand). I’ll first search specifically for "Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport" via the Search textbox (element 162), then click Go to locate it. Once I have the hotel’s POI, I can use the directions tool ("Find directions between two points") to set the hotel as the start and "supermarket" as the destination, switching to walking mode and reading the distance. For now, the next step is to enter the hotel search into the search field.

To continue, I should try another Hilton brand known near PIT—"Hampton Inn Pittsburgh Airport." The search bar (bid 162) is visible and currently contains "DoubleTree by Hilton Pittsburgh Airport".

✅ Current Progress:
- OpenStreetMap is open and centered around Pittsburgh International Airport.
- Searched for “Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport” and “DoubleTree by Hilton Pittsburgh Airport” → both returned “No results found.”
- Updated the search field to “Hampton Inn Pittsburgh Airport,” but this query has not been executed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is relevant to the goal (identify a nearby Hilton-brand hotel and then measure walking distance to a supermarket).
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Textbox “Search” (id 162): value = “Hampton Inn Pittsburgh Airport”, focused, visible, editable.
  - Button “Go” (id 165): visible and enabled; used to execute the current query.
  - Link “Find directions between two points” (id 167): visible; will be used after selecting a hotel POI to compute walking distance to a supermarket.
  - Results panel currently shows “Search Results → Nominatim → No results found” (reflects prior query, not the current unexecuted text).
  - Map controls available: “Zoom In” (id 434), “Zoom Out” (id 436), “Show My Location” (id 439), “Query features” (id 454).
- The workflow is on the critical path; no error or off-track state detected.

The user needs a Hilton-brand hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport and then the shortest walking distance to a supermarket from that hotel. I'm on OpenStreetMap with the search box currently containing "Hampton Inn Pittsburgh Airport" (a Hilton brand). The results pane still shows "No results found" from a previous query, which indicates that the current query hasn't been executed. The correct next step is to click the "Go" button to run the search for "Hampton Inn Pittsburgh Airport." Once I get a result, I will select it, then use the "Find directions between two points" tool to set walking mode and search for "supermarket" as the destination to retrieve the shortest walking distance. For now, the single best action is to execute the current search by clicking Go.

✅ Current Progress:

The user wants a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport and then the shortest walking distance from that hotel to a supermarket. I’m on OpenStreetMap with the search textbox currently containing “Pittsburgh International Airport” (element 162), but the results displayed are unrelated (global Hilton entries like “Hilton Chennai”), meaning the current airport query hasn’t been executed.

We need to find a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh International Airport and then the shortest walking distance to a supermarket from that hotel. We’re on OpenStreetMap, centered around PIT. The search results currently show “No results found” for “DoubleTree by Hilton Pittsburgh Airport.” A common variation in OSM naming for this property is “DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Pittsburgh Airport.” Since the search box is visible (bid 162) and using the search tool is the most efficient, I’ll update the query to this alternative name, then in the next step I will click Go.
