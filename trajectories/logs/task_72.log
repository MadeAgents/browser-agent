The user asks for the ZIP code of Yale University. According to the task tips, I should use the OpenStreetMap search to find the location and then read the full address, ensuring it includes the ZIP code. The current page is OpenStreetMap with the search textbox [162] focused and a "Go" button [165] visible. The most efficient next step is to type "Yale University" into the search field and then click "Go" afterward. For now, I will enter the query into the search box.

The user wants the ZIP code of Yale University. We're on OpenStreetMap with the search field already populated with "Yale University" (element [162]), and the "Go" button (element [165]) is available. According to the task tips, I should use the OpenStreetMap search to find the address and extract the ZIP code from the result. The next logical step is to initiate the search by clicking the "Go" button. Once results appear, I will select the relevant result that provides a full address including the ZIP code. Avoid scrolling unless necessary. So I will click the "Go" button now.
