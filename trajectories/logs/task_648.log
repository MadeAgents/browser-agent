The user wants a submission in the dataisbeautiful forum. I am on the global "Create submission" page with fields: URL (radio selected), Title (required), Body, Forum (combobox currently "Choose one…"), and a "Create submission" button. Per the task tips, I need to ensure the forum is correctly selected. The most immediate step is to select the "dataisbeautiful" forum from the Forum combobox before filling in the Title and Body. Using the select_option action on the combobox (bid 378) with "dataisbeautiful" should set the forum correctly.

The goal is to create a post in the dataisbeautiful forum. I’m on the global “Create submission” form. The Forum field is a combobox (bid 378) with an inner textbox (bid 379), not a native select, so my previous select_option attempt failed. To choose the forum, I should first expand the combobox by clicking it, which should reveal or focus the inner search/input to type “dataisbeautiful” and then select it. After the forum is set, I’ll fill the Title and Body (leaving the URL empty, per tips) and submit. The next best step is to click the Forum combobox to open it.

The task is to post in the dataisbeautiful forum about how large language models could help the corresponding field. I’m on the “Create submission” page with the Forum already set to “dataisbeautiful” and the Title filled: “How could large language models help data visualization?”. The URL field should remain empty per the posting tips, and all content goes into the Body. The Body textbox [142] is currently empty, so the next best step is to fill it with a thoughtful prompt that invites discussion and includes concrete areas where LLMs can help data visualization. After filling the Body, I will submit the form in the following step.
