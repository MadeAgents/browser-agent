The user wants to reduce the price of size 28 Sahara leggings by 13.5%. To do this in Magento Admin, I need to navigate to the product list to find "Sahara Leggings", then locate the size 28 variant and adjust its price accordingly. The current page is the Dashboard. The top navigation bar includes a "CATALOG" link, which is the correct entry point to access products.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the Catalog > Products grid in Magento Admin. No price changes made yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path for editing product pricing, but the current filters are unrelated to the goal. Active filters show “Keyword: Hollister” and “Name: Green,” which will prevent finding “Sahara leggings.” Relevant interactive elements:
- button “Clear all” [919] — visible and enabled; clears all active filters.
- buttons to remove individual filters [911] and [916] — visible; remove “Keyword: Hollister” and “Name: Green.”
- textbox “Search by keyword” [1402], value='Hollister' — visible and editable; currently set to an irrelevant term.
- button “Search” [1403] — visible and enabled; executes the keyword search.
- button “Filters” [902] — visible; opens additional filtering options if needed.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button “Clear all” [919] to remove the unrelated filters.
- Type “Sahara leggings” into textbox “Search by keyword” [1402], then click button “Search” [1403] to locate the product and proceed to edit the size 28 variant’s price.

The goal is to reduce the price of the size 28 Sahara leggings by 13.5%. I’m on the simple product edit page for “Sahara Leggings-28-Blue,” and I’ve already computed the discounted price using calculate() and updated the “[global] Price * $” field to 64.88. To apply this change, I need to save the product. The “Save” button [888] is visible and enabled.

The goal is to reduce the price of all size 28 Sahara Leggings variants by 13.5%. I’ve already updated and saved the Blue and Gray variants to 64.88, and the current active tab is the Gray variant page showing “You saved the product.” The remaining size 28 variant to update is Red. To quickly access the Red variant, it’s most efficient to switch to the already open tab containing the configurable product page (Tab 0), where the Configurations table lists all size 28 variants with direct links to their edit pages. Clicking Back from the current page previously led to the Products grid, adding extra steps. Therefore, I will switch to Tab 0 to open the parent product page directly and then proceed to edit the Red variant in subsequent steps.
