The user wants the email address of the customer who is the most unhappy with the product "Circe fleece." In Magento, “most unhappy” likely corresponds to the lowest review rating. To find this, I should navigate to the reviews section. The tips mention that all reviews can be found under MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews. From there, I can search for reviews related to "Circe fleece," identify the lowest-rated review (e.g., 1 star), get the reviewer’s customer name, and then retrieve their email. If the email isn’t visible directly in the review details, I can use the customer name to locate their account under CUSTOMERS to get the email.

Given the current page is the Dashboard, the first step is to click on MARKETING in the top navigation to access the reviews area. I will click the "MARKETING" link in the top menubar (bid 226).

The user needs the email address of the customer who is the most unhappy with the product "Circe fleece." In Magento, customer unhappiness for a product is typically inferred from the lowest product review rating. To find this, I should:

- Filter/search for reviews related to "Circe fleece."
- Identify the review with the lowest rating (e.g., 1 star being the most unhappy).
- Open that review to see the reviewer details. If the email is not visible directly on the review page, I can use the linked customer profile to obtain the email.

The goal is to find the email address of the customer who is the most unhappy with "Circe fleece." We are already on the Reviews grid in Marketing > User Content > Reviews. To isolate relevant reviews, I should filter the grid by the Product column for "Circe." The filter row shows a textbox under the Product column (bid 851). I will first enter "Circe" in that textbox, then in the next step I will press the "Search" button to apply the filter. Once filtered, I can open each review for "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" and check ratings to find the lowest (most unhappy), then obtain the reviewer's email (if the reviewer is a registered customer).

The user wants the email address of the customer who is the most unhappy with Circe fleece. "Most unhappy" in this Magento context is best inferred from reviews with the lowest rating. We’re already on Marketing > User Content > Reviews and have filtered the grid to “Circe,” showing 1 record for “Circe Hooded Ice Fleece.” The list doesn’t show the rating or reviewer’s email, so I need to open the review detail via the “Edit” link to inspect the rating and reviewer details. The row shows Type “Guest,” which might mean there is no associated customer account (and thus possibly no email stored), but I must check the review details to confirm whether an email is present.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path (Marketing > User Content > Reviews) and currently lists reviews matching “Circe.”

The user needs the email address of the customer who is the most unhappy with “Circe fleece.” In Magento, “most unhappy” typically corresponds to the lowest review rating for that product. We’re on Marketing > User Content > Reviews with the Product filter set to “Circe,” showing only 1 record, and that record’s Type is “Guest.” Guest reviews won’t provide a customer email.

To ensure whether any registered customer reviews exist for the product (which could give us an email), I should filter the “Type” column to “Customer” while keeping the Product filter as “Circe.” If the result is empty, we can conclude there are no customer reviews for that product; if there is a result, we can open it to find the rating and then the reviewer/customer details including email.

The next step is to open the “Type” filter combobox so I can select “Customer” and refine the results.

The objective is to find the email address of the customer who is most unhappy with "Circe fleece," which in this Magento context should correspond to the lowest-rated review for that product submitted by a registered customer (since we need an email). We’re on the Reviews grid filtered by Product = "Circe," showing only 1 review that is a Guest (no email). To verify whether any registered customer reviews exist for this product, I should filter the Type to "Customer." The filter row’s Type combobox (bid 844) is already expanded, showing options including "Customer" (option 847). The next action is to select "Customer" from the combobox, and in the following step I will click Search to apply the filter and see if any customer-authored reviews exist.

Goal: Find the email address of the customer who is most unhappy with the Circe fleece. In Magento, "most unhappy" likely equates to the lowest review rating for that product, and since we need an email address, the reviewer must be a registered customer (not a guest).

Current page: Reviews grid under Marketing > User Content > Reviews, filtered by Product = "Circe". Currently, the grid shows 1 record and it’s from a Guest. I attempted to choose "Customer" in the Type combobox by clicking the option (847), but it timed out due to the option not being visible. To proceed, I should set the Type combobox to "Customer" using a more reliable method (select_option) and then apply the filter (Search) to see if any customer-authored reviews exist. If none exist, we'll likely need to report that there are no customer reviews and thus no email.

Next step: Use select_option on the Type combobox (bid 844) to choose "Customer". After that, I will click Search in a subsequent step to apply the filter.

The user wants the email address of the customer who is most unhappy with Circe fleece. “Most unhappy” likely corresponds to the lowest-rated review for the product, and since they ask for a customer email, the reviewer must be a registered customer (not a guest).

I’m on the Reviews grid under Marketing > User Content > Reviews. The filters currently show:
- Product filter textbox has “Circe”.
- Type filter is set to “Customer”.
- The grid shows “0 records found,” meaning there are no customer-authored reviews for products matching “Circe”.

To confirm whether any reviews exist at all (possibly from guests or admin) and then determine if there are customer-authored reviews, I should clear the Type filter from “Customer” back to blank, keeping the Product filter as “Circe,” and then in the next step apply the filter via Search. This will show all reviews for “Circe” and help verify if none are by customers. If none exist, I’ll have to inform the user that the task is infeasible due to no customer reviews for the product.

The next single action should change the Type combobox from “Customer” to blank using select_option on the Type filter combobox (bid 844), so I can subsequently click Search.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The Reviews grid is the correct place to identify the lowest-rated review for the product and obtain a customer email if the reviewer is a registered customer.
- Current grid state: “1 records found,” row shows Product = “Circe Hooded Ice Fleece,” Type = Guest.
- Relevant interactive elements (visible/enabled):
  - Product filter textbox (id: 851) — value: “Circe”.
  - Type filter combobox (id: 844) — blank; when set to “Customer” and searched, returns 0 records.
  - Search button (id: 712) and Reset Filter (id: 715).
  - Row “Edit” link (id: 874) — opens review details (Author = Guest).
- Conclusion: There are no customer-authored reviews for “Circe fleece,” so no customer email can be derived from reviews. The page is on the correct path, but available data makes the requested email unavailable.
