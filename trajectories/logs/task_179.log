The user wants to open their latest created issue that has “feature” in its title and check if it is closed. From the dashboard, the most efficient way is to use the top navigation “Issues” link, which typically brings up an issues list with filters. Once there, I can filter by author (Me/byteblaze), enter “feature” in the search, sort by Created date (descending), and open the top-most (latest created) issue. The first step is to navigate to the Issues listing by clicking the “Issues” link in the top bar (element [153]).

✅ Current Progress: Arrived on the GitLab Issues dashboard listing. No filtering for “feature” or author has been applied yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal: it lists issues across projects and provides filters and sorting needed to locate the latest created issue with “feature” in its title.
- Filters/search:
  - Token “Assignee = Byte Blaze” is active (element: button labeled “Assignee = Byte Blaze”, id [318]); a small button within it ([324]) appears to remove this token. This limits results by assignee, not by creator.
  - Search textbox ([327]) is present and currently empty; it’s editable and ready for query input.
  - “Recent searches” button ([290]) is available (not essential).
- Sorting:
  - Sort control shows “Updated date” ([519], hasPopup='listbox'), meaning the list is currently sorted by updated time rather than creation time.
  - “Sort direction” control ([566]) is available to toggle ascending/descending.
- Scope tabs:
  - Links for “Open 15” ([265]), “Closed 53” ([269]), and “All 68” ([273]) are visible and enabled to change the issue scope.
- Issue list items:
  - Each issue row includes a title link (e.g., “[647] link '[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement'”; other examples: “[574] '404 for many URLs'”, “[599] 'Let's keep the project alive'”). The “Feature” example visible ([647]) is present but not necessarily created by you (the a11y tree shows a nearby item created by “earle” in this section).
  - Per-item metadata shows created time and author (e.g., “[579] link 'Byte Blaze'” on some items), which will be useful to confirm authorship once filtered.

The current configuration (assignee filter applied, sorted by Updated date, no “feature” query) is not yet aligned with the goal of finding “my latest created” issue with “feature” in its title. However, the necessary controls to refine the list are present and enabled.

The user wants me to open their latest created issue with "feature" in its title and then check if it is closed. On the Issues dashboard, I can see multiple issues with titles starting "[Feature suggestion] ...". I need the latest created among those created by the user (Byte Blaze). From the list:
- "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" was created by Rohan Kumar, so it is not the user's.
- "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" was created on Jan 22, 2023 by Byte Blaze.
- "[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form" was created Jan 20, 2023 by Byte Blaze.
- "[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider" was created Jan 19, 2023 by Byte Blaze.

Therefore, the latest created by Byte Blaze with "feature" in the title is "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" (Jan 22, 2023). To proceed, I should click that issue’s title link to open it and then check its status on the detail page.

The user asked to open their latest created issue with “feature” in the title and check if it is closed. We are already on the issue detail page for “[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode” (#39). This appears to be the latest created “Feature suggestion” issue by Byte Blaze (from prior navigation). On the page, I see a status badge that reads “Open” and there is a “Close issue” button available, which confirms the issue is currently open (i.e., not closed). The best next step is to report this status back to the user using send_msg_to_user, since no further navigation is required.
