The user wants a route from Carnegie Mellon University to the home stadium of the Philadelphia 76ers. On OpenStreetMap, the most efficient way is to use the built-in directions tool rather than manually searching and scrolling. The page’s accessibility tree shows a link labeled “Find directions between two points” with bid 167. Clicking this should open the directions panel where I can input the start and end locations.

The user requested directions from Carnegie Mellon University to the Philadelphia 76ers’ home stadium in the 1970s. That arena was The Spectrum, located within the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. The OpenStreetMap directions panel already shows a computed car route from CMU to “South Philadelphia Sports Complex” with full addresses, distance, and time, and includes detailed turn-by-turn steps. To fulfill the user's goal, I should present the route details clearly and concisely, including the start/destination addresses, total distance, total time, and the exact steps with distances as shown. No further interaction on the page is needed; the best next action is to send the directions to the user via a message.
