The user asks for the minimum travel time by car from CMU Gates building to Schenley Park. On OpenStreetMap, the best approach is to use the built-in directions tool. The page shows the search box and the "Find directions between two points" link (two-arrow icon) to the right of the Go button. Following the task tips, I should click that directions link to open the directions panel where I can enter the starting location and destination. Once the panel is open, I will input "CMU Gates building" for the start and "Schenley Park" for the destination, ensuring Pittsburgh, PA locations, and then run the route to read the car travel time. So the immediate next action is to click the directions link [167].

The user wants the minimum travel time by car from CMU Gates building to Schenley Park. The OpenStreetMap directions panel is already open with Car mode selected and two textboxes labeled "From" [194] and "To" [199]. The correct workflow is to input the origin and destination, then compute the route to read the travel time. To ensure correct disambiguation, I'll specify "Pittsburgh, PA" with the CMU Gates building, which on OSM is typically "Gates Center for Computer Science." The next step is to fill the "From" field [194] with "Gates Center for Computer Science, Pittsburgh, PA". After that, I will fill the "To" field and trigger the route calculation (likely by pressing Enter or letting it auto-compute). For now, I will start by filling the "From" field.
