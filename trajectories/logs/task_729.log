The user wants me to dislike (downvote) all submissions created by AdamCannon in the subreddit (forum) UpliftingNews. To do this efficiently, I need to find either:
- The UpliftingNews forum and then filter for posts by user AdamCannon, or
- The user profile for AdamCannon and then downvote only those submissions that belong to the UpliftingNews forum.

Given the task tips: "when the task mentions subreddit, it is referring to ‘forum’" and "if you have to find submissions (posts) or comments by a particular user, visit user profile to see the list", plus "use filters to narrow down results." The current home page does not show the UpliftingNews forum or AdamCannon posts. The right sidebar shows "Subscribed forums" but UpliftingNews is not listed. Therefore, I should navigate to the Forums page to locate UpliftingNews. From there, I can access its submissions and then find posts by AdamCannon, likely via a search or filter in that forum.

First, I will click the "Forums" link in the top navigation to reach the forums page, where I can look for "alphabetical" sorting/filter to find UpliftingNews, as per the tips.

✅ Current Progress: Executed a site-wide search for “UpliftingNews” and arrived at a results page. No AdamCannon submissions found; no dislikes/downvotes performed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page shows generic search results (mostly comments) containing the term “UpliftingNews,” not the UpliftingNews forum nor the user “AdamCannon.” This is not directly on the critical path to disliking AdamCannon’s submissions in that forum.
- Relevant elements:
  - Search field: searchbox labeled “Search query” [112], visible, focused, currently filled with “UpliftingNews”.
  - Search trigger: button “Search” [115], visible, enabled.
  - Result actions: “Downvote” buttons (e.g., [169], [221]) are visible/enabled but associated with comments by other users (e.g., “simbadv” [125], “ItsTheAlgebraist” [181]); none show “AdamCannon”.
  - Navigation: link “Forums” [36], visible/enabled, can be used to reach the forum list and locate UpliftingNews.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Type “AdamCannon” into the search field [112] and click the “Search” button [115] to locate the user profile; from there, find submissions and downvote those in the UpliftingNews forum.
- Alternatively, click the “Forums” link [36] to navigate to the forum list, then access the UpliftingNews forum and locate submissions by “AdamCannon” to downvote.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “All forums” directory and selected the “Alphabetical” view. No dislikes/downvotes performed yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path toward the goal, as it lists forums alphabetically, which is needed to locate “UpliftingNews.”
- Relevant elements:
  - searchbox labeled “Search query” [48] in the top navigation; visible, focusable, editable (current contents not specified).
  - navigation links “Forums” [110], “Tags” [112], and “Alphabetical” [114]; all visible and clickable.
  - forum links under lettered headings (e.g., “AskReddit” [127], “IAmA” [215]); these are visible and clickable. The specific “UpliftingNews” forum link is not shown in the provided axtree excerpt, but it should be accessible within this alphabetical listing (likely under the “U” section). Opening that forum is required before filtering for posts by “AdamCannon” and performing dislikes.

The goal is to dislike all submissions by AdamCannon within the UpliftingNews forum. I'm currently on the "All forums" page in alphabetical view, and I can see the "UpliftingNews" forum link under the "U" section in the accessibility tree as link [356]. The most efficient next step is to navigate into the UpliftingNews forum. Once on the forum page, I can look for filters or search within the forum to find submissions by the user "AdamCannon" and then perform the dislikes on each of those submissions. Therefore, I will click the UpliftingNews forum link.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the /f/UpliftingNews forum and opened its Submissions feed. No downvotes performed yet; no posts by “AdamCannon” identified on the current view.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The page is on the critical path toward the goal—this is the correct forum’s submissions list where downvotes can be applied per post.
- Relevant elements for progressing:
  - Submissions/Comments navigation: links “Submissions” [123] and “Comments” [125]; visible and clickable.
  - Sorting: button “Sort by: Hot” [128], has popup menu (expanded=False); visible and clickable.
  - Search: searchbox “Search query” [57]; visible, focusable, editable.
  - Per-post author and actions (examples from visible items):
    - Article with author link “ybdiel” [156]; Downvote button [179] enabled.
    - Article with author link “AudibleNod” [194]; Downvote button [217] enabled.
    - Article with author link “mancinedinburgh” [232]; Downvote button [255] enabled.
    - Article with author link “AmethystOrator” [270]; Downvote button present (not shown in excerpt index here but consistent with others).
  - Observation: None of the currently visible authors match “AdamCannon,” so downvoting these would not meet the goal. The agent should locate posts where the author link text equals “AdamCannon” before using the corresponding Downvote button.

The goal is to dislike (downvote) all submissions by AdamCannon in the UpliftingNews forum. I’m currently on the UpliftingNews submissions list and I can see one article that is explicitly “Submitted by AdamCannon” (node [840] shows the author link). For that item, the voting section includes a Downvote button (node [863]). Since this is a matching submission, the correct next step is to downvote it. After this, I can proceed to find any other submissions by AdamCannon (e.g., via their profile) and downvote those as well, but first I should execute the visible downvote to start fulfilling the task.

✅ Current Progress: 
- Navigated to /f/UpliftingNews submissions feed.
- Executed one Downvote click (element id 863), but the author of that submission is not verified as “AdamCannon.” No confirmed dislikes of AdamCannon’s posts yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The page is on the critical path: it is the UpliftingNews forum’s Submissions list where downvoting is possible.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Searchbox “Search query” [57] — visible, focusable, editable (empty/unspecified content).
  - Sorting control “Sort by: Hot” button [128] — visible, clickable, menu collapsed (expanded=False).
  - Submissions list items show author links and vote controls. Examples currently visible do not match “AdamCannon”:
    - Post by “ybdiel” [156] with Downvote button [179] — enabled.
    - Post by “AudibleNod” [194] with Downvote button [217] — enabled.
    - Post by “mancinedinburgh” [232] with Downvote button [255] — enabled.
- Deviation detected: A downvote was performed without confirming the author is “AdamCannon,” which risks acting on non-target posts.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Type “AdamCannon” into the searchbox labeled “Search query” [57] and press Enter to locate the user/profile or posts, then only downvote submissions authored by “AdamCannon.” Avoid using Downvote buttons [179], [217], [255] since their authors don’t match.
