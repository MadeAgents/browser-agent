The user asks for the full name, GitLab account name, location, and email of the contributor with the most commits to the branch "php52" in the "archive-my-tweets" project. To find this, I should navigate to the "Contributors" tab within the Repository section, which typically shows contributors and commit counts and often provides a branch filter. The current page is the Files view for a specific commit reference, and the left sidebar shows the Repository sub-tabs, including "Contributors". Clicking "Contributors" should allow me to filter by branch "php52", identify the top contributor, and then visit their profile to retrieve full name, username, location, and email.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the project’s Contributors page. Viewing contributor stats, but currently filtered to “github/fork/chtitux/addRssFeed” rather than the required branch “php52”.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path for identifying the top committer, but the branch filter is incorrect for the goal. Relevant interactive elements:
- Button labeled “github/fork/chtitux/addRssFeed” ([498]): visible and clickable; likely the ref/branch selector.
- Link “History” ([515]): visible; not needed for this task.
- Sidebar links under Repository (e.g., “Commits” [299], “Branches” [302], “Contributors” [308]): visible; “Contributors” is already active.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button labeled “github/fork/chtitux/addRssFeed” (element [498]) and select the branch “php52” from the dropdown to reload contributors for that branch.
