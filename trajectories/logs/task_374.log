The user wants to preview the Magento Blank theme. In Magento Admin, theme-related actions are under the Content section, typically Content > Design > Themes, where themes like "Magento Blank" can be viewed and sometimes previewed. From the dashboard, I should first navigate to the Content area. The accessibility tree shows a "CONTENT" link with bid 293 in the top navigation menubar. Clicking that is the logical next step to reach the design and themes settings.
