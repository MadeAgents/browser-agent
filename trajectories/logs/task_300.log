The user wants to show the most recent pending order page. To access orders, I should navigate via the account section. On the current homepage, the header contains a "My Account" link (bid 227). According to the tips, I should go to My Account > My Orders to locate orders and then identify the most recent one with status "pending" and open its page. The first step is to click "My Account" to reach the account dashboard where the "My Orders" section should be available.

✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the “My Account” dashboard where the “Recent Orders” table is visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal. The “Recent Orders” table (table labeled “Recent Orders” [1534]) lists multiple orders with their statuses and action links. From the marked screenshot:
- There are several “Pending” orders; the most recent by date is the row dated 5/12/23 (Status: Pending).
- Each row has an Action link labeled “View Order” (visible text: “View Order”, links appear enabled).
- A “View All” link ([1530] “View All”) is also present and enabled, which leads to the full order history if needed.

To show the most recent pending order page, click the “View Order” link in the row whose Status is “Pending” and Date is 5/12/23.

The user wants to open the most recent pending order page. I’m on the “My Account” dashboard, which includes a “Recent Orders” table listing order number, date, status, and action links. I need to identify the most recent order with status “Pending” and click its “View Order” link.

From the table:
- 000000170 on 5/17/23 — Canceled
- 000000189 on 5/2/23 — Pending
- 000000188 on 5/2/23 — Pending
- 000000187 on 5/2/23 — Pending
- 000000180 on 3/11/23 — Complete

The pending orders all share the date 5/2/23. The highest order number among them is 000000189, which is therefore the most recent. In that row, the “View Order” link is element [1565]. Clicking this should navigate to the order details page for the most recent pending order.
