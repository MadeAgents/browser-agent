The user wants the total cost of their latest non-cancelled order. According to the Task Tips, I should navigate to My Account > My Orders to view order history and identify the latest order that is not cancelled. We're on the homepage, logged in as Emma Lopez (Sign Out link is visible). The top banner shows a "My Account" link (node [227]). The next step is to click "My Account" to access account options, then proceed to "My Orders". I will click the "My Account" link now.

✅ Current Progress: Landed on the “My Account” dashboard where the “Recent Orders” table is visible.

🔍 Current State Analysis: This page is on the critical path to the goal. The “Recent Orders” section lists recent order rows with columns: Order #, Date, Ship To, Order Total, Status, and Action. Relevant elements:
- table 'Recent Orders' [1534]: visible and populated with multiple orders showing their Status and Order Total.
- link 'View All' [1530]: visible/enabled; opens the full orders list if needed.

From the visible rows, the most recent order at the top shows Status “Canceled,” so the target is the next most recent row with a Status other than “Canceled” (e.g., “Pending” or “Complete”) and its corresponding “Order Total.”

The user wants the total cost of their latest non-cancelled order. On the My Account page, the "Recent Orders" table lists the most recent orders with status and totals. The first row is order 000000170 dated 5/17/23 with status "Canceled," so it is excluded. The next most recent entries are dated 5/2/23. Among those, the topmost (and highest order number) is 000000189 with status "Pending" (not cancelled) and an "Order Total" of $754.99. Per the instruction to return just the decimal when asked how much is spent, I will respond with 754.99.

✅ Current Progress: 
- Opened the “My Account” dashboard and located the “Recent Orders” table.
- Identified that the most recent order is “Canceled,” but an answer was prematurely provided (“754.99”) without validating the correct non-cancelled order total.

🔍 Current State Analysis: 
- The current page is on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant elements:
  - table 'Recent Orders' [1534]: visible and populated with orders showing Order #, Date, Ship To, Order Total, Status, and Action.
  - link 'View All' [1530]: visible and enabled.
- From the visible rows: the top row is “Canceled” and should be skipped. The next row (dated 5/2/23) has Status “Pending” and shows Order Total “$744.99,” which is the latest non-cancelled order total.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Extract the Order Total from the first row in table [1534] whose Status is not “Canceled” and return the numeric value only: 744.99.
- If additional confirmation is needed, click link 'View All' [1530], then open the topmost non-cancelled order (“View Order”) and read its grand total before replying.
