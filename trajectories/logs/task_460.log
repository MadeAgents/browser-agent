The user wants the price reduced by 15%. The product edit page shows the current Price field value as 45.00 (textbox with bid 985). Per the instructions, any numerical calculation must use the calculate() function. So my first step is to compute the new price by applying a 15% reduction: 45.00 * 0.85. After I get the result, I will fill the Price field with the computed value and then click Save (button with bid 876) in subsequent steps.

The goal is to reduce the product’s price by 15%. I already computed the new price using the required calculate() function: 45.00 * 0.85 = 38.25. The product edit page shows the Price field as a textbox with identifier 985 and current value 45.00. The correct next step is to update this Price field to 38.25. After updating the field, I will click the Save button (identifier 876) in a subsequent step to persist the change. I will avoid any redundant actions and focus on filling the price field first.

The goal is to reduce the product price by 15%. I previously computed the reduced price using calculate() and updated the Price field to 38.25. The current page shows the Price textbox value as 38.25, confirming the change is in place. To finalize the update, I need to save the product. The Save button is visible at the top right with identifier 876. Clicking Save will persist the price change. I will avoid repeating any input actions and proceed to save.
