✅ Current Progress: Navigated to the a11yproject.com project page on GitLab. No issues list viewed or label filtering applied yet.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is the project’s overview and is on the critical path toward the goal. Relevant interactive elements to proceed:
- Project navigation link “Issues” (node [332], visible/enabled, shows count “43”).
- Top navigation link “Issues” (node [183], visible/enabled).
- Global search textbox “Search GitLab” (node [146], visible/empty) — not required for project issues.

To display issues with “help needed” labels, the agent should first open the project’s Issues page via either “Issues” link (preferably [332]). Filtering controls for labels will be available on the Issues page.

The user wants to display the list of issues in the a11yproject/a11yproject.com repository that have labels related to “help needed.” I’m currently on the project overview page. I tried clicking the project sidebar “Issues” link (element [332]) previously, but it resulted in a timeout due to scroll-into-view issues, likely because the sidebar element wasn’t stable or visible enough to interact.

To avoid repeating an action that just timed out, I should use an alternative navigation path. The top global navigation bar includes an “Issues” link (element [183]) which will take me to an issues list view. Although it typically shows issues across projects, I can then filter by project and labels. This approach will move me forward reliably, and once on the issues page, I can apply the necessary filters to show only issues from the specific repository with labels indicating help is needed.

Therefore, the next best action is to click the top navigation “Issues” link ([183]) to reach the issues page.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The current page is the project overview, which is on the critical path but not yet the repository’s issues list. Relevant interactive elements to proceed:
- Link “Issues” in Project navigation (node [332], visible/enabled, shows count “43”) — this is the repository-specific issues link.

The goal is to show issues in the a11yproject/a11yproject.com repository that have help-needed related labels. I'm already on the project's Issues page with the "Open 43" tab selected, and I can see individual issues with their labels. One visible issue ("Create an Offline page" #1064) includes a label link "help wanted" (element [923]). In GitLab, clicking a label link within the issues list typically navigates to the issues list filtered by that label. This is a reliable way to apply the exact label filter without relying on potentially finicky free-text search syntax in the "Search or filter results..." box. Therefore, the best next step is to click the "help wanted" label link to display the list of issues labeled "help wanted," which matches the user's request for help-needed related labels.

The user’s goal is to display the list of issues in the a11yproject/a11yproject.com repository that have labels related to help needed. I’m already on the repository’s Issues page with the filter bar showing “Label = ~help wanted,” and the “Open 8” tab is selected. The issues list below shows eight open issues, each including the “help wanted” label. To fulfill the goal, I should present this filtered list to the user with each issue number and title. Since the page is already correctly filtered, no further UI interaction is needed—just sending the compiled list via send_msg_to_user.
