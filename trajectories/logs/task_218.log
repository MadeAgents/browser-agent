✅ Current Progress: Entered the search query “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh” into the site’s Search box.

🔍 Current State Analysis: The agent is on OpenStreetMap, which is suitable for locating CMU and checking nearby hotels and walking routes. The map is not yet centered on CMU (search not executed). Relevant interactive elements:
- Textbox labeled “Search” (id/index [162]): value set to “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh”, focused.
- “Go” button (id/index [165]): visible and clickable; should trigger the search to center on CMU.
- “Find directions between two points” link (id/index [167]): visible and clickable; useful for computing walking routes once CMU and a hotel are selected.
- Map tools: “Zoom In” ([434]) and “Zoom Out” ([436]) links, “Query features” ([454]) for identifying POIs like hotels.
- Optional: “Close” button ([217]) on the welcome panel, if it obstructs interaction with the map (currently the search controls are usable).

Goal: Identify walking distances from nearby hotels to CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) that are at most 5 minutes. I’m on OpenStreetMap centered near CMU with search results shown for CMU. To find nearby hotels efficiently, using the search bar to query “hotel” is faster than manually scanning the map. The search box [162] is available and currently contains “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh.” I’ll replace it with “hotel” to get hotel results biased around the current map center (CMU). After getting hotel results, I can then use the “Find directions between two points” tool to compute walking times from each hotel to CMU and filter those at or below 5 minutes. Since only one action is allowed per step, the next best action is to fill the search box with “hotel.”

The user needs walking distances from nearby hotels to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) that are at most 5 minutes. We're currently on OpenStreetMap centered near CMU with a search results panel. To efficiently find hotels close to CMU, it’s better to search for hotels near CMU rather than scanning the map. The search box [162] is visible and supports queries. I will update the search query to “hotel near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA” to bias the results around CMU. After this, I will execute the search and then use the directions tool to compute walking routes/times to CMU and filter those at or below 5 minutes. For now, I’ll perform the input step.

The user wants walking distances from nearby hotels to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) that are at most 5 minutes. I’m on OpenStreetMap centered around CMU, but the search results panel says “No results found” for the hotel query. However, the map itself shows several bed icons (hotels) around Fifth Avenue and Schenley Plaza. The most reliable way to identify specific nearby hotels from the current map is to use the “Query features” tool, then click directly on bed icons to get each hotel’s details and use routing from/to CMU.

Plan:
1) Activate the “Query features” tool to enable clicking on map features.
2) Click on a bed icon near CMU to open its details panel.
3) Use the “Find directions between two points” tool to compute walking directions from that hotel to CMU; ensure walking mode and capture distance/time.

The user wants hotels within a 5-minute walk to CMU and the walking distances. I’m on OpenStreetMap with the Directions panel open. “To” is already set to “Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA.” The routing mode is currently Car; to evaluate walking times/distances accurately, I need to switch to Foot. After enabling Foot, I’ll identify nearby hotels and compute routes from each hotel (as From) to CMU (as To), filtering those with ≤5 minutes and reporting their walking distances.

The goal is to find walking distances from nearby hotels to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) that are at most 5 minutes. I'm on the OpenStreetMap Directions panel with "To" already set to CMU. The routing mode is currently set to Bicycle (radio [176] is focused and checked true), which is incorrect for walking-time evaluation. Previously, clicking the Foot radio [179] did not work due to UI overlap. A reliable way is to navigate the radio group via keyboard arrows. Since Bicycle is focused, pressing ArrowRight should select Foot. After setting Foot, I can proceed to pick nearby hotels (using Query features to click bed icons) and compute walking routes from each hotel to CMU, then filter those ≤5 minutes and report their distances. The immediate next action is to switch the mode to Foot by pressing ArrowRight on the currently focused Bicycle radio.

Objective: Determine walking distances from nearby hotels to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) that take at most 5 minutes. Current page context shows the OpenStreetMap Directions panel is open with “Foot” mode selected and the “To” field already set to CMU. The “From” field is empty. To compute walking times/distances, I should input a nearby hotel into the “From” field and let OSRM calculate the walking route. Given the difficulty of precisely clicking bed icons on the map with the Query Features tool in this environment, a more reliable approach is to type the name of a known nearby hotel and compute the route. “The Oaklander Hotel, Pittsburgh” is a well-known hotel near Schenley Plaza, relatively close to CMU. Although it’s likely more than 5 minutes away, calculating it will help determine if any fall within 5 minutes and proceed accordingly.

To check other nearby hotels, the fastest approach is to enter another hotel's name into the "From" field and compute the walking time/distance. A likely nearby candidate is “Wyndham Pittsburgh University Center,” which is closer to CMU than The Oaklander; we should test it next. Since only a single action is permitted per step, the next best action is to fill the "From" textbox [194] with “Wyndham Pittsburgh University Center, Pittsburgh” to set up the next route calculation (and I can submit/confirm it in a subsequent step).

The user asks for nearby hotels to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Pittsburgh, that are within a 5-minute walk, and wants the walking distances. Using OpenStreetMap’s Directions panel (already open), we should:
- Keep “To” as CMU (already set to “Carnegie Mellon University, …, 15213, United States”).
- Ensure routing mode is Foot (already selected).
- Try candidate nearby hotels as “From” and compute walking times/distances via OSRM.
- Keep only those with time ≤ 0:05 and report the walking distances (in meters per the tips).

Current state:
- The Directions panel shows a route From: Wyndham Pittsburgh University Center, To: CMU with Distance 1.3km and Time 0:17 (17 minutes), which exceeds 5 minutes.
- We need to test other nearby hotels. Efficiently, try “Mansions on Fifth” (a hotel on Fifth Avenue in Shadyside area, which might be closer than Wyndham, though likely still >5 minutes) to see if any approach ≤5 minutes. If not, continue testing others (e.g., The Oaklander, Shadyside Inn All Suites, Courtyard Shadyside, Hyatt House Bloomfield/Shadyside), but we proceed one action at a time.

Next best step: Replace the “From” field with “Mansions on Fifth, Pittsburgh” to compute a new walking route. After this, I will press Enter to trigger routing, check the time/distance, and filter based on the 5-minute threshold.

Task: Show walking distances from nearby hotels to CMU (Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh) that take at most 5 minutes. We're on OpenStreetMap’s Directions panel with Foot mode active. "To" is set to CMU. We've tried a few hotels (The Oaklander, Wyndham Pittsburgh University Center, Mansions on Fifth), each yielding 1.3km / 0:17, which is well above the 5-minute threshold. To be thorough, I should test another nearby hotel. A reasonable next candidate is “Shadyside Inn All Suites Hotel,” which has multiple buildings in Shadyside; likely still >5 minutes, but we should compute it. The immediate step is to input that hotel name into the “From” field to prepare for route calculation, then I will press Enter in a subsequent step to compute the route. This aligns with the approach of systematically testing nearby hotels and filtering those ≤5 minutes.
