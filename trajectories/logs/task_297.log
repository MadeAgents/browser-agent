The user wants the SSH clone command for the most starred "Covid location tracker" repository. The current page is the Projects dashboard showing various repositories, but not obviously related to Covid. To find the relevant repository across GitLab, navigating to the Explore section is a logical next step because Explore lets us browse popular projects (including "Most Stars") across the entire instance rather than just the user's projects. Once in Explore, I can look for a repository matching "Covid location tracker" and then access its clone options (SSH). Since only one action is allowed per step, I will first click the "Explore" link to reach the broader catalog of repositories.
