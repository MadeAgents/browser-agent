Goal: Identify the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Sorrells Library using the OpenStreetMap page. Current page shows search results with an item “Sorrells Library, 5000, Forbes Avenue…” [481], and the map is roughly centered on CMU. To ensure the map is precisely centered on the library POI and possibly open its detail/context, the best next step is to click the specific search result link [481]. This often pins/highlights the location, making it easier to use the Query features tool to find nearby restaurants.

Plan:
1) Click the search result [481] for Sorrells Library to center and select it.
2) Then use Query features and click nearby to list amenities such as restaurants (e.g., “Hunan Express” appears on the map).
3) Compare proximities and report the closest restaurant(s).

✅ Current Progress:
- Entered “Sorrells Library Pittsburgh” in the Search box and clicked “Go,” centering the map around Sorrells Library.
- Activated the “Query features” tool.
- Attempted to click the map to get nearby features, but the sidebar overlay prevented interaction.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The OpenStreetMap page is directly relevant to the goal (finding the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Sorrells Library).
- A blocking overlay (“Welcome to OpenStreetMap!”) is still open, hindering map clicks.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Button [217] “Close” — visible/enabled; needed to dismiss the overlay.
  - Link [454] “Query features” — visible/enabled; use to list nearby features after clicking on the map.
  - Map tiles [488]–[507], [581] — visible/clickable; clicking near “Sorrells Library” should return nearby amenities.
  - Textbox [162] “Search” — visible/enabled; content state not shown.
  - Button [165] “Go” — visible/enabled.
  - Zoom controls: Link [434] “Zoom In” and Link [436] “Zoom Out” — visible/enabled for precision.
- The page shows nearby POIs (e.g., “La Prima Espresso,” “Rothberg’s Roasters II,” “Hunan Express”), but their exact categories/distances are not yet confirmed via query results.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click button with id [217] labeled “Close” to dismiss the overlay.
- With “Query features” active, click on a visible map tile near the “Sorrells Library” label (e.g., image [500]) to open the query results listing nearby amenities and distances.

Objective: Identify the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Sorrells Library using the OpenStreetMap page. The map is already centered around CMU with Sorrells Library visible, and I previously activated the "Query features" tool. However, the "Welcome to OpenStreetMap!" sidebar overlay is still open and likely blocking clicks on the map, as indicated in the accessibility tree by button [217] "Close" and the visible overlay text. My last attempt clicked a different close id ([209]) that didn't exist here, so I should now click the correct "Close" button [217] to dismiss the overlay. After closing it, I can click near the "Sorrells Library" marker on the map (with the query tool active) to list nearby features and determine the closest restaurant(s) by distance. Therefore, the best next single action is to click the Close button [217].

The user wants the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Sorrells Library. I already activated the “Query features” tool and closed the overlay that was blocking map clicks. The map shows Sorrells Library and nearby POIs including “Hunan Express” (a restaurant icon) and cafés like La Prima Espresso and Rothberg’s Roasters II. To determine the closest restaurant precisely, I should click on the map near Sorrells Library to trigger the query results panel, which lists nearby features with their tags and distances. The map is composed of multiple tile image elements; clicking one of these tiles should register a map click now that the overlay is closed. I will click a central tile (e.g., [500]) near the Sorrells Library area to bring up the query results.

Task: Find the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Sorrells Library using the OpenStreetMap page. The map is already centered on Sorrells Library, and I activated the “Query features” tool. Previous attempts to click a map tile image (e.g., bid 500) failed because the map container div intercepted pointer events. That suggests I should click the map container itself rather than the child image tiles to trigger the query at the current location.

Plan:
- Click the map container element (div id="map", bid 401) so the “Query features” tool can display the list of nearby features with distances.
- Then, identify any features tagged as “restaurant” and determine the nearest one(s).

Given the error log indicates the container is bid 401, I will click that now.

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- The OpenStreetMap “Query Features” page centered around Sorrells Library is directly relevant to finding the closest restaurant(s).
- The query results panel is active: “Nearby features” list [602] currently includes “University Building — Wean Hall” and “Recreation Ground — The Mall.”
- Relevant interactive elements for progressing:
  - Link [454] “Query features” — enabled/visible; active for querying by map click.
  - Map container [401] and tile images [488]–[507], [581] — visible/clickable; clicking closer to the “Sorrells Library” label should refine nearby results.
  - Zoom controls [434] “Zoom In” and [436] “Zoom Out” — visible/enabled for precise selection.
  - Textbox [162] “Search” and Button [165] “Go” — visible/enabled (optional).
- From the marked screenshot, nearby labeled POIs include “Hunan Express” (north/east of the library), “La Prima Espresso,” and “Rothberg’s Roasters II.” A precise map click near the library or those labels is needed to surface restaurant-tagged entries and determine the closest.

✅ Current Progress:
- Searched for “Sorrells Library Pittsburgh” and centered the map on the CMU area.
- Activated the “Query features” tool; the Query Features sidebar is open.
- A map click was attempted, but the Nearby features list currently shows only “Wean Hall” and “The Mall” (no restaurants identified yet).

🔍 Current State Analysis:
- This OpenStreetMap “Query Features” page is on the critical path to the goal.
- Relevant interactive elements:
  - Link “Query features” [454] — visible/enabled; tool appears active.
  - Map container [401] — visible/clickable; needs a precise click near the Sorrells Library label to return nearby POIs with distances.
  - Zoom controls “Zoom In” [434] and “Zoom Out” [436] — visible/enabled for fine-grained clicking.
  - Nearby features list [602] — currently lists:
    - University Building — “Wean Hall” [611]
    - Recreation Ground — “The Mall” [613]
- The agent prematurely answered (“Hunan Express”) without confirming via the query results; no validated closest restaurant has been derived from the tool yet.

➡️ Next-step Guidance:
- Click the map container [401] right on/next to the “Sorrells Library” label to refresh the Nearby features list with distances and identify entries tagged as restaurants.
- If restaurants still don’t appear, click “Zoom In” [434], then click the map container [401] again very close to the library marker (or directly near the “Hunan Express” label) to surface restaurant POIs.
