I have two tabs: Tab 0 has the Create submission form, and the active Tab 1 is a blank page. To accurately include the repo description, I should retrieve it directly from the source rather than relying on memory. The best next step is to navigate the currently active blank tab to the GitHub repository page. Once I have the exact description, I can switch back to the Create submission tab to fill in the title \"auth0/angular-storage\", include the URL and the description in the Body (as per Reddit task tips, place all content including URLs in the Body), select \"technology\" as the forum, and submit. Therefore, I will navigate to the repository page now.\n</think>\n<action>\n```goto('https://github.com/auth0/angular-storage')```\n</action>",
