I opened a new tab to fetch the description from GitHub, but navigation failed due to a certificate error (net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID), and the active tab is currently a blank error page. Since I cannot retrieve the description right now, the most productive step is to return to the \"Create submission\" form already open in Tab 0. There, I can start preparing the post by setting the title and forum, and later fill the body once I obtain the exact description. To proceed, I need to switch focus back to Tab 0 which contains the submission form.\n</think>\n<action>\n```tab_focus(0)```\n</action>",
