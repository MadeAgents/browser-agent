To ensure accuracy, I need to access the offline Wikipedia archive specified in the Task Tips. I already opened a new tab, which is currently blank. The most efficient next step is to navigate directly to the Kiwix Wikipedia landing page URL (http://10.177.37.113:8888/wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2022-05/A/User:The_other_Kiwix_guy/Landing) rather than going via the homepage index, so I can use its search to find the Umayyad Caliphate page. Once there, I will search for \u201cUmayyad Caliphate,\u201d open the page, locate any section or navbox listing Arabian Peninsula dynasties/states/emirates, and extract them. After compiling the list, I will return to the Postmill tab to make the post with the specified title and body format. The current page is about:blank, so the next action is to navigate to the Kiwix landing page.\n</think>\n<action>\n```goto('http://10.177.37.113:8888/wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2022-05/A/User:The_other_Kiwix_guy/Landing')```\n</action>",
