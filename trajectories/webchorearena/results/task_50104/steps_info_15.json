I have two tabs: Tab 0 has the GitLab Web IDE open at README.md, and Tab 1 is a blank tab. I will need the exact first paragraph from the Wikipedia article to paste into the README. Although a note indicates that a paragraph was saved, it appears incomplete and possibly malformed (missing closing parenthesis and last sentence). To ensure accuracy, it\u2019s best to retrieve the first paragraph directly from the offline Wikipedia site, which is allowed per the task tips. I\u2019m currently in a blank tab, so I should navigate to the offline Wikipedia landing page to search for \u201cGenerative adversarial network\u201d and get the precise first paragraph. After obtaining it, I can switch back to the IDE tab to replace README.md content and commit. The immediate next step: navigate to the offline Wikipedia site.\n</think>\n<action>\n```goto('http://10.177.37.113:8888/wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2022-05/A/User:The_other_Kiwix_guy/Landing')```\n</action>",
