Wikipedia article and commit the change, creating README.md if it doesn\u2019t exist. Based on the prior steps, I have already filled the README.md with the correct paragraph (without citation marks) and clicked the Commit button in the GitLab Web IDE to commit on a new branch with an MR. However, the current active tab (Tab 0) shows a blank chrome error page (chrome-error://chromewebdata/) with no interactive elements, indicating that the page might be stuck or failed to load after the commit. To verify the commit and proceed, I should attempt to reload the page so it can properly display the post-commit view (e.g., MR page or updated IDE state). If refresh doesn\u2019t resolve it, I can go back in history afterward, but since only one action is allowed, the best immediate step is to refresh the page using the browser reload shortcut.\n</think>\n<action>\n```keyboard_press('ControlOrMeta+r')```</action>",
