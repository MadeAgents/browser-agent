I already forked the repo and opened README.md in the Web IDE in Tab 0. I opened a new tab (Tab 1), which is currently about:blank, to fetch the paragraph. The Task Tips provide a direct offline Wikipedia URL, which is preferable to using the homepage directory. Therefore, the most efficient next step is to navigate this blank tab to the offline Wikipedia landing page so I can search for \"Super Mario Bros.\" and copy the first paragraph accurately. After obtaining it, I will return to the IDE tab to replace and commit the README content. Since only one action is allowed, I will navigate to the offline Wikipedia landing page now.\n</think>\n<action>\n```goto('http://10.177.37.113:8888/wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2022-05/A/User:The_other_Kiwix_guy/Landing')```\n</action>",
