I previously navigated to the GitLab Web IDE and encountered branch creation errors, then clicked a breadcrumb to exit, but now the current page is a blank error page (chrome-error://chromewebdata/) with no interactive elements. This suggests the last navigation failed or the page didn\u2019t load correctly. To continue towards creating the CSV file, the most effective next step is to navigate back to the previous page (likely the GitLab repository page). Using the browser's back function should return me to a functional page where I can proceed to add the new file through the repository UI. I will avoid repeating actions that previously failed (like trying to re-open the Web IDE immediately). The single best action now is to go back.\n</think>\n<action>\n```go_back()```\n</action>",
