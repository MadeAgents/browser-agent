All prices must be formatted to exactly two decimal places and must include a \"$\" symbol. The items in the CSV file must be sorted primarily in ascending order by price, and secondarily in ascending order by SKU when prices are equal.

Currently, the active tab is a blank page (about:blank), and there is no content to interact with. The user provided a homepage URL that lists all available websites, including OneStopShop: http://10.177.124.109:4399. The next logical step is to navigate to that homepage so I can access the OneStopShop site. From there, I will locate OneStopShop, enter the \"Cell Phones & Accessories > Accessories > Automobile Accessories\" category, and use filters to restrict the price between $100.00 and $199.99. After gathering SKU, price, UPC, and ASIN details, I will switch to GitLab to create or confirm the \"byteblaze/shopping\" repository and add the CSV file with proper formatting and sorting. For now, the immediate action is to navigate to the homepage listing the sites.\n</think>\n<action>\n```goto('http://10.177.124.109:4399')```\n</action>",
