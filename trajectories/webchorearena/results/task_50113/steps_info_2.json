The repository is already open in Tab 0, while the active tab (Tab 1) is about:blank. To gather the customer data, I need to access the homepage at http://10.177.124.109:4399, which lists available websites including the Merchant Admin Portal, and use the credentials from the password page if necessary. Since the current tab is blank, the next step is to navigate to the homepage. After reaching the homepage, I will locate and log into the Merchant Admin Portal, filter customers by Colorado and Illinois, collect the required fields (Name, Email, Phone, State/Province, Customer Since), sort by Customer Since (newest to oldest), and then return to the GitLab repository to create the CSV file colorado_illinois.csv with the correct formatting.
