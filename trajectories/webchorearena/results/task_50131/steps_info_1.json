The note instructs me to use the homepage at http://10.177.124.109:4399 to access allowed websites (including Reddit) and find passwords if needed. Therefore, the next best step is to navigate to that homepage to locate Reddit and begin gathering the \"most commented\" submissions for r/wallstreetbets using the \"All time\" time span. Once I have the data, I can return to the GitLab tab to create/update the repository and CSV file.
