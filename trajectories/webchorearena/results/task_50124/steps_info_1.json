The current active tab is a blank page (about:blank), and there is also a GitLab dashboard tab available. To gather pending reviews, I need to navigate to the hub page that lists available websites at http://10.177.124.109:4399, then locate the Merchant Admin Portal link, log in with credentials from the password page if necessary, find the pending reviews section, collect the required fields for all pending reviews, and format/sort them. After collecting data, I will switch to GitLab to verify or create the repository and add the CSV file via the web UI. The immediate next step is to navigate to the homepage that lists sites.\n</think>\n<action>\n```goto('http://10.177.124.109:4399')```\n</action>",
