The repository already exists (as per the previously opened GitLab tab), and I opened a new tab to handle browsing for the Merchant Admin Portal data. The current active tab is about:blank with no content, so the next immediate step is to navigate to the homepage at 10.177.124.109:4399, which aggregates links to internal sites and has a password page with credentials. From there, I will locate the Merchant Admin Portal, log in using credentials from /password.html if necessary, navigate to reviews, filter to Approved, sort by Created descending (newest), collect details for the top 10, then later return to GitLab to create and commit the CSV. Given the environment tip to not scroll and to use navigation/search efficiently, going directly to the homepage via URL is the best next action.\n</think>\n<action>\n```goto(\"http://10.177.124.109:4399\")```\n</action>",
