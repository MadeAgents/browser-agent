I currently have two tabs: Tab 0 is a GitLab dashboard, which I will use later to create the repository and upload the CSV. Tab 1 (active) is about:blank. To start collecting the product data, I need to navigate to the homepage that lists websites at http://10.177.124.109:4399, from which I can access OneStopShop. Therefore, the next best step is to navigate the active tab to that homepage. This aligns with the benchmark tip to use the homepage to find the target site and also avoids losing the GitLab dashboard for later steps.\n</think>\n<action>\n```goto('http://10.177.124.109:4399')```\n</action>",
