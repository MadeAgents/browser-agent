From the prior steps, I had created the repo, opened README.md in the Web IDE, pasted the Markdown content, and initiated a commit. However, the current tab shows a chrome-error://chromewebdata/ blank error page, which indicates the page has crashed or lost context. To proceed effectively, I should navigate to the hub homepage provided (http://10.177.124.109:4399) which lists accessible websites (including the code hosting platform). From there, I can re-open the Git platform, navigate to the olympic_baseball repository, and verify/complete the commit (and merge if needed). The immediate next best step is to navigate to the homepage.\n</think>\n<action>\n```goto('http://10.177.124.109:4399')```\n</action>",
