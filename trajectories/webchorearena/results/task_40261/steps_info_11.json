Previously, I edited the file in the GitLab Web IDE and clicked Commit, which likely created a new branch and a merge request because committing directly to main was disabled. However, the current tab shows a chrome error page (chrome-error://chromewebdata/) with a blank screen and no interactive elements in the accessibility tree, so I cannot verify the commit or proceed further from this error state.\n\nGiven the page is in an error state and there are no UI elements to interact with, the best way to recover is to navigate back to the previous page, which should return us to the GitLab Web IDE or repository view where I can confirm the commit/MR status and, if possible, complete the workflow. Using go_back is appropriate here as it uses browser history to restore the last working page.\n</think>\n<action>\n```go_back()```</action>",
