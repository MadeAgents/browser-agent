To find OneStopShop and login credentials (if needed), the instructions suggest using the homepage hub at http://10.177.124.109:4399, which lists available websites and their credentials via the linked password page. From the blank tab, the most efficient next action is to navigate to the hub URL to locate the OneStopShop link. I won\u2019t scroll since it's not supported; loading the hub page should present navigation options, ideally including OneStopShop.\n\nThus, I will navigate to the hub URL first to proceed toward OneStopShop.\n</think>\n<action>\n```goto('http://10.177.124.109:4399')```\n</action>",
