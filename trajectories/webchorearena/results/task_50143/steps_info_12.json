Each displayed vote count is 0. I compiled the titles, applied the required sorting (votes desc -> all 0 ties, so title asc), and stored the CSV content in a note via take_note. Now I need to create the repository and file.\n\nTo do that, I should visit the centralized homepage at http://10.177.124.109:4399 to access the list of sites (including the Git hosting platform) and the credentials page if needed. The active tab is currently Tab 1 (about:blank), which I had focused for navigation. The next logical action is to navigate this tab to the homepage so I can proceed to the Git hosting service, log in using the credentials from the password page, create \"byteblaze/reddit\" (if missing), and add the CSV file content.\n\nTherefore, I will navigate Tab 1 to the hub URL http://10.177.124.109:4399.\n</think>\n<action>\n```goto(\"http://10.177.124.109:4399\")```\n</action>",
