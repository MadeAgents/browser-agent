Although the GitLab repository is open in Tab 0, I still need to collect the Reddit data. The currently active tab (Tab 1) is a blank page, so it\u2019s best to use it to navigate to the provided homepage at http://10.177.124.109:4399, which lists websites and credentials that I can use to access Reddit-related tools or forums. From there, I can find an appropriate site to search for r/worldnews submissions, apply filters for \u201cmost commented\u201d and \u201call time,\u201d and compile the data. After gathering the data, I\u2019ll return to the GitLab tab to create and commit the CSV file.
