I previously saved a version of the text, but it contains punctuation and wording issues, which risks violating the \"word for word\" requirement. Therefore, I need to re-visit the offline Wikipedia to extract the precise wording without citations.\n\nCurrent context: I\u2019m in a new, blank tab (about:blank). The best next action is to navigate to the offline Wikipedia (Kiwix) landing page provided in the task tips so I can search for \"Cricket (sport)\", open the article, and locate the \"World cricket in the 20th century\" section to extract the correct text.\n\nPlan:\n1) Navigate to the Kiwix landing page.\n2) Use the page search to find \"Cricket (sport)\".\n3) Open the article and jump to the \"World cricket in the 20th century\" section.\n4) Copy the paragraph(s) exactly, omitting bracketed citations, and save via take_note.\n5) Return to the sports forum and submit the post with the specified title and cleaned body.\n\nNext action: Load the offline Wikipedia landing page in the current blank tab.\n</think>\n<action>\n```goto('http://10.177.37.113:8888/wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2022-05/A/User:The_other_Kiwix_guy/Landing')```\n</action>",
