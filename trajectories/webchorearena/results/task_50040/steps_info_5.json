A fall, on or off the event, is a 1.00 deduction, in elite level gymnastics. The introduction of the difficulty score is a significant change. The gymnast's difficulty score is based on what elements they perform and is subject to change if they do not perform or complete all the skills, or they do not connect a skill meant to be connected to another. Connection bonuses are where deviation happens most commonly between the intended and actual difficulty scores, as it can be difficult to connect multiple flight elements. It is very hard to connect skills if the first skill is not performed correctly. The new code of points allows the gymnasts to gain higher scores based on the difficulty of the skills they perform as well as their execution.

The original term for the practice of gymnastics is from the related Greek verb \u03b3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9 (\n      gumn\u00e1z\u014d\n      ), which translates as \"to train naked or nude\" because young men exercising trained without clothing. In ancient Greece, physical fitness was a highly valued attribute in both men and women. It wasn't until after the Romans conquered Greece in 146BC that gymnastics became more formalized and used to train men in warfare.\n      <span bid=\"166\" class=\"mw-ref reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\">\n       <a bid=\"167\" href=\"#cite_note-5\" style=\"counter-reset: mw-Ref 5;\">\n        &lt;::after&gt;\n        <span bid=\"168\" class=\"mw-reflink-text\">\n         [5]\n        </span>\n       </a>\n      </span>\n      Based on Philostratus' claim that gymnastics is a form of wisdom, comparable to philosophy, poetry, music, geometry, and astronomy,\n      <span bid=\"169\" class=\"mw-ref reference\" id=\"cite_ref-:1_4-1\">\n       <a bid=\"170\" href=\"#cite_note-:1-4\" style=\"counter-reset: mw-Ref 4;\">\n        &lt;::after&gt;\n        <span bid=\"171\" class=\"mw-reflink-text\">\n         [4]\n        </span>\n       </a>\n      </span>\n      Athens combined this more physical training with the education of the mind.

During the 1920s, women organized and participated in gymnastics events. The first women's Olympic competition was limited, only involving synchronized calisthenics and track and field. These games were held in 1928, in Amsterdam. By 1954, Olympic Games apparatus and events for both men and women had been standardized in modern format, and uniform grading structures (including a point system from 1 to 15) had been agreed upon.

With an A Score (or D score) being the difficulty score, which as of 2009 is based on the top 8 high scoring elements in a routine (excluding Vault). The B Score (or E Score), is the score for execution and is given for how well the skills are performed.\n      <span bid=\"220\" class=\"mw-ref reference\" id=\"cite_ref-usagym.org_13-0\">\n       <a bid=\"221\" href=\"#cite_note-usagym.org-13\" style=\"counter-reset: mw-Ref 13;\">\n        &lt;::after&gt;\n        <span bid=\"222\" class=\"mw-reflink-text\">\n         [13]\n        </span>\n       </a>\n      </span>\n     </details>\n     <details bid=\"223\" data-level=\"2\" open=\"\">\n      <summary bid=\"224\" class=\"section-heading\">\n       &lt;::marker&gt;\n       <h2 bid=\"225\" id=\"FIG-recognized_disciplines\">\n        FIG-recognized disciplines\n       </h2>\n      </summary>\n      <div bid=\"226\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\" role=\"note\">\n       See also:\n       <a bid=\"227\" href=\"List_of_gymnastics_competitions\" title=\"List of gymnastics competitions\">\n        List of gymnastics competitions\n       </a>\n       and\n       <a bid=\"228\" href=\"Major_achievements_in_gymnastics_by_nation\" title=\"Major achievements in gymnastics by nation\">\n        Major achievements in gymnastics by nation\n       </a>\n      </div>\n      The following disciplines are governed by FIG.\n      <details bid=\"230\" data-level=\"3\" open=\"\">\n       <summary bid=\"231\" class=\"section-heading\">\n        &lt;::marker&gt;\n        <h3 bid=\"232\" id=\"Artistic_gymnastics\">\n         Artistic gymnastics\n        </h3>\n       </summary>\n       <div bid=\"233\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\" role=\"note\">\n        Main article:\n        <a bid=\"234\" href=\"Artistic_gymnastics\" title=\"Artistic gymnastics\">\n         Artistic gymnastics\n        </a>\n       </div>\n       Artistic Gymnastics is usually divided into Men's and Women's Gymnastics.

In some countries, women at one time competed on the rings, high bar, and parallel bars (for example, in the 1950s in the\n       <a bid=\"246\" class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"USSR\" title=\"USSR\">\n        USSR\n       </a>\n       ).\n       In 2006, FIG introduced a new point system for Artistic gymnastics in which scores are no longer limited to 10 points. The system is used in the US for elite level competition.\n       <span bid=\"248\" class=\"mw-ref reference\" id=\"cite_ref-usagym.org_13-1\">\n        <a bid=\"249\" href=\"#cite_note-usagym.org-13\" style=\"counter-reset: mw-Ref 13;\">\n         &lt;::after&gt;\n         <span bid=\"250\" class=\"mw-reflink-text\">\n          [13]\n         </span>\n        </a>\n       </span>\n       Unlike the old code of points, there are two separate scores, an execution score and a difficulty score. In the previous system, the execution score was the only score. It was and still is out of 10.00, except for short exercises. During the gymnast's performance, the judges deduct this score only. A fall, on or off the event, is a 1.00 deduction, in elite level gymnastics. The introduction of the difficulty score is a significant change. The gymnast's difficulty score is based on what elements they perform and is subject to change if they do not perform or complete all the skills, or they do not connect a skill meant to be connected to another. Connection bonuses are where deviation happens most commonly between the intended and actual difficulty scores, as it can be difficult to connect multiple flight elements. It is very hard to connect skills if the first skill is not performed correctly. The new code of points allows the gymnasts to gain higher scores based on the difficulty of the skills they perform as well as their execution. There is no maximum score for difficulty, as it can keep increasing as the difficulty of the skills increase.\n      </details>\n      <details bid=\"251\" data-level=\"4\" open=\"\">\n       <summary bid=\"252\" class=\"section-heading\">\n        &lt;::marker&gt;\n        <h4 bid=\"253\" id=\"Competitive_events_for_women_in_artistic_gymnastics\">\n         Competitive events for women in artistic gymnastics\n        </h4>\n       </summary>\n       <div bid=\"254\" class=\"thumb tright\">\n        <div bid=\"255\" class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:172px\">\n         <img bid=\"256\" data-file-height=\"3504\" data-file-type=\"bitmap\" data-file-width=\"2336\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"255\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../I/PIked_Tsukahara_L9_Reginals.jpg.webp\" width=\"170\"/>\n         <div bid=\"257\" class=\"thumbcaption\" style=\"text-align: left\">\n          Piked\n          <a bid=\"258\" href=\"Tsukahara_(vault)\" title=\"Tsukahara (vault)\">\n           Tsukahara vault\n          </a>\n         </div>\n        </div>\n       </div>\n      </details>\n      <details bid=\"259\" data-level=\"5\" open=\"\">\n       <summary bid=\"260\" class=\"section-heading\">\n        &lt;::marker&gt;\n        <h5 bid=\"261\" id=\"Vault\">\n         Vault\n        </h5>\n       </summary>\n       <div bid=\"262\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\" role=\"note\">\n        Main article:\n        <a bid=\"263\" href=\"Vault_(gymnastics)\" title=\"Vault (gymnastics)\">\n         Vault\n        </a>\n       </div>\n       In the vaulting events, gymnasts sprint down a\n       25 metres (82\n       ft)\n       runway, to take off  onto a vault board (or perform a roundoff or handspring entry onto a vault board),  to land momentarily inverted on the hands on the vaulting horse or vaulting table (pre-flight segment), then propel themselves forward or backward off that platform to a two-footed landing (post-flight segment). Every gymnast starts at a different point on the vault runway depending on their height and strength. The post-flight segment may include one or more multiple saltos, or twisting movements. A round-off entry vault, called a\n       <a bid=\"268\" href=\"Yurchenko_(vault)\" title=\"Yurchenko (vault)\">\n        Yurchenko\n       </a>\n       , is a commonly performed vault in the higher levels in gymnastics. When performing a Yurchenko, gymnasts round-off so their hands are on the runway while their feet land on the vault board. From the round-off position, the gymnast travels backward so that the hands land on the vaulting table. The gymnast then blocks off the vaulting platform into various twisting and/or somersaulting combinations. The post-flight segment brings the gymnast to her feet.  Less difficult vaults include taking off from the vault board with both feet at the same time and either doing a front handspring or round-off onto the vaulting table.\n       In 2001, the traditional vaulting horse was replaced with a new apparatus, sometimes known as a tongue, horse, or vaulting table. The new apparatus is more stable, wider, and longer than the older vaulting horse, approximately 1 m in length and 1 m in width, giving gymnasts a larger blocking surface. This apparatus is thus considered safer than the vaulting horse used in the past. With the addition of this new, safer vaulting table, gymnasts are attempting more difficult vaults.\n       <span bid=\"270\" class=\"mw-ref reference\" id=\"cite_ref-14\">\n        <a bid=\"271\" href=\"#cite_note-14\" style=\"counter-reset: mw-Ref 14;\">\n         &lt;::after&gt;\n         <span bid=\"272\" class=\"mw-reflink-text\">\n          [14]\n         </span>\n        </a>\n       </span>\n       <div bid=\"273\" class=\"thumb tright\">\n        <div bid=\"274\" class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px\">\n         <img bid=\"275\" data-file-height=\"2336\" data-file-type=\"bitmap\" data-file-width=\"3504\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"147\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"../I/Skubik_on_Uneven_Bars_2006.JPG.webp\" width=\"220\"/>\n         <div bid=\"276\" class=\"thumbcaption\" style=\"text-align: left\">\n          Gymnast on uneven bars\n         </div>\n        </div>\n       </div>\n      </details>\n      <details bid=\"277\" data-level=\"5\" open=\"\">\n       <summary bid=\"278\" class=\"section-heading\">\n        &lt;::marker&gt;\n        <h5 bid=\"279\" id=\"Uneven_bars\">\n         Uneven bars\n        </h5>\n       </summary>\n       <div bid=\"280\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\" role=\"note\">\n        Main article:\n        <a bid=\"281\" href=\"Uneven_bars\" title=\"Uneven bars\">\n         Uneven bars\n        </a>\n       </div>\n       On the uneven bars, the gymnast performs a timed routine on two parallel horizontal bars set at different heights.

In the past, bars were made of wood, but the bars were prone to breaking, providing an incentive to switch to newer technologies. The width and height of the bars may be adjusted to the size needed by individual gymnasts. In the past, the uneven parallel bars were closer together. The bars have been moved increasingly further apart, allowing gymnasts to perform swinging, circling, transitional, and release moves that may pass over, under, and between the two bars. At the Elite level, movements must pass through the handstand. Gymnasts often mount the uneven bars using a\n       <a bid=\"285\" href=\"Springboard_(gymnastics)\" title=\"Springboard (gymnastics)\">\n        springboard\n       </a>\n       or a small mat.

The English abbreviation for the event in gymnastics scoring is FX. In the past, the floor exercise event was executed on the bare floor or mats such as wrestling mats. The floor event now occurs on a carpeted 12m \u00d7 12m square, usually consisting of hard foam over a layer of\n       <a bid=\"325\" href=\"Plywood\" title=\"Plywood\">\n        plywood\n       </a>\n       , which is supported by springs generally called a spring floor. This provides a firm surface that provides extra bounce or spring when compressed, allowing gymnasts to achieve greater height and a softer landing after the composed skill. Gymnasts perform a choreographed routine for up to 90 seconds in the floor exercise event. Depending on the level, the gymnast may choose their own routine; however some levels have compulsory routines, where default music must be played. Levels three to six the music is the same for each levels along with the skills within the routine. However, recently, the levels have switched. Now, levels 6\u201310 are optional levels and they get to have custom routines made. In the optional levels (levels six to ten) there are skill requirements for the routine but the athlete is able to pick her own music without any words. The routine should consist of tumbling passes, series of jumps, leaps, dance elements, acrobatic skills, and turns, or pivots, on one foot. A gymnast can perform up to four tumbling passes, each of which usually includes at least one flight element without hand support. Each level of gymnastics requires the athlete to perform a different number of tumbling passes. In level 7 in the United States, a gymnast is required to do 2\u20133, and in levels 8\u201310, at least 3\u20134 tumbling passes are required.\n       <span bid=\"326\" class=\"mw-ref reference\" id=\"cite_ref-16\">\n        <a bid=\"327\" href=\"#cite_note-16\" style=\"counter-reset: mw-Ref 16;\">\n         &lt;::after&gt;\n         <span bid=\"328\" class=\"mw-reflink-text\">\n          [16]\n         </span>\n        </a>\n       </span>\n      </details>\n      <details bid=\"329\" data-level=\"5\" open=\"\">\n       <summary bid=\"330\" class=\"section-heading\">\n        &lt;::marker&gt;\n        <h5 bid=\"331\" id=\"Scoring\">\n         Scoring\n        </h5>\n       </summary>\n       Scoring for both Junior Olympic and NCAA level gymnastics uses a 10.0 scale. Levels below Level 9 start from a 10.0 automatically if all requirements for an event are met. Levels 9 and 10, and NCAA gymnastics all start below a 10.0 and require gymnastics to acquire bonus points through connections and skills to increase their start value to a 10.0. During a routine, deductions will be made by the judges for flaws in the form of the technique of a skill. For example, steps on landings or flexed feet can range from .05-.1 off, depending on the severity of the mistake.\n       <span bid=\"333\" class=\"mw-ref reference\" id=\"cite_ref-17\">\n        <a bid=\"334\" href=\"#cite_note-17\" style=\"counter-reset: mw-Ref 17;\">\n         &lt;::after&gt;\n         <span bid=\"335\" class=\"mw-reflink-text\">\n          [17]\n         </span>\n        </a>\n       </span>\n      </details>\n      <details bid=\"336\" data-level=\"5\" open=\"\">\n       <summary bid=\"337\" class=\"section-heading\">\n        &lt;::marker&gt;\n        <h5 bid=\"338\" id=\"Floor_2\">\n         Floor\n        </h5>\n       </summary>\n       <div bid=\"339\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\" role=\"note\">\n        Main article:\n        <a bid=\"340\" href=\"Floor_(gymnastics)\" title=\"Floor (gymnastics)\">\n         Floor\n        </a>\n       </div>\n       Male gymnasts also perform on a 12meter x 12meter spring floor. A series of tumbling passes are performed to demonstrate flexibility, strength, and balance. Strength skills include circles, scales, and press handstands. Men's floor routines usually have multiple passes that have to total between 60\u201370 seconds and are performed without music, unlike the women's event.

Single leg skills are generally found in the form of scissors, an element often done on the pommels. Double leg work, however, is the main staple of this event. The gymnast swings both legs in a circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise depending on preference) and performs such skills on all parts of the apparatus. To make the exercise more challenging, gymnasts will often include variations on a typical circling skill by turning (moores and spindles) or by straddling their legs (Flares). Routines end when the gymnast performs a dismount, either by swinging his body over the horse or landing after a handstand variation.\n      </details>\n      <details bid=\"353\" data-level=\"5\" open=\"\">\n       <summary bid=\"354\" class=\"section-heading\">\n        &lt;::marker&gt;\n        <h5 bid=\"355\" id=\"Still_rings\">\n         Still rings\n        </h5>\n       </summary>\n       <div bid=\"356\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\" role=\"note\">\n        Main article:\n        <a bid=\"357\" href=\"Rings_(gymnastics)\" title=\"Rings (gymnastics)\">\n         Still Rings\n        </a>\n       </div>\n       The rings are suspended on wire cable from a point 5.75 meters from the floor.

The gymnast is allowed to choose where they start on the runway. The body position is maintained while punching (blocking using only a shoulder movement) the vaulting platform. The gymnast then rotates to a standing position. In advanced gymnastics, multiple twists and somersaults may be added before landing. Successful vaults depend on the speed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle, the kinesthetic awareness in the air, how well they stuck the landing, and the speed of rotation in the case of more difficult and complex vaults.\n      </details>\n      <details bid=\"365\" data-level=\"5\" open=\"\">\n       <summary bid=\"366\" class=\"section-heading\">\n        &lt;::marker&gt;\n        <h5 bid=\"367\" id=\"Parallel_bars\">\n         Parallel bars\n        </h5>\n       </summary>\n       <div bid=\"368\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\" role=\"note\">\n        Main article:\n        <a bid=\"369\" href=\"Parallel_bars\" title=\"Parallel bars\">\n         Parallel Bars\n        </a>\n       </div>\n       Men perform on two bars executing a series of swings, balances, and releases that require great strength and coordination.

At its simplest, each club rotates once per throw, the handle moving down and away from the throwing hand at first.

Additional points (with no maximum at the highest levels of competition) can be earned depending on the difficulty of the moves and the length of time taken to complete the ten skills which is an indication of the average height of the jumps. In high level competitions, there are two preliminary routines, one which has only two moves scored for difficulty and one where the athlete is free to perform any routine. This is followed by a final routine which is optional. Some competitions restart the score from zero for the finals, other add the final score to the preliminary results.\n      </details>\n      <details bid=\"487\" data-level=\"5\" open=\"\">\n       <summary bid=\"488\" class=\"section-heading\">\n        &lt;::marker&gt;\n        <h5 bid=\"489\" id=\"Synchronized_trampoline\">\n         Synchronized trampoline\n        </h5>\n       </summary>\n       Synchronized trampoline is similar except that both competitors must perform the routine together and marks are awarded for synchronization as well as the form and difficulty of the moves.\n      </details>\n      <details bid=\"491\" data-level=\"5\" open=\"\">\n       <summary bid=\"492\" class=\"section-heading\">\n        &lt;::marker&gt;\n        <h5 bid=\"493\" id=\"Double-mini_trampoline\">\n         Double-mini trampoline\n        </h5>\n       </summary>\n       <div bid=\"494\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\" role=\"note\">\n        Main article:\n        <a bid=\"495\" href=\"Double_mini_trampoline\" title=\"Double mini trampoline\">\n         Double mini trampoline\n        </a>\n       </div>\n       Double mini trampoline involves a smaller trampoline with a run-up, two scoring moves are performed per routine.

It differs from Rhythmic Gymnastics in that body movement is large and continuous and teams are larger. Athletes do not use apparatus in international AGG competitions compared to Rhythmic Gymnastics where ball, ribbon, hoop and clubs are used on the floor area. The sport requires physical qualities such as flexibility, balance, speed, strength, coordination and sense of rhythm where movements of the body are emphasized through the flow, expression and aesthetic appeal. A good performance is characterized by uniformity and simultaneity. The competition program consists of versatile and varied body movements, such as body waves, swings, balances, pivots, jumps and leaps, dance steps, and lifts.

Vertical ground reaction force represents an external force which the gymnasts have to overcome with their muscle force and affects the gymnasts' linear and angular momentum. Another important variable that affects linear and angular momentum is the time the landing takes. Gymnasts can decrease the impact force by increasing the time taken to perform the landing. Gymnasts can achieve this by increasing hip, knee and ankle amplitude.\n       <span bid=\"735\" class=\"mw-ref reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Marinsek,_M._2010_39-2\">\n        <a bid=\"736\" href=\"#cite_note-Marinsek,_M._2010-39\" style=\"counter-reset: mw-Ref 39;\">\n         &lt;::after&gt;\n         <span bid=\"737\" class=\"mw-reflink-text\">\n          [39]\n         </span>\n        </a>\n       </span>\n      </details>\n     </details>\n     <details bid=\"738\" data-level=\"2\" open=\"\">\n      <summary bid=\"739\" class=\"section-heading\">\n       &lt;::marker&gt;\n       <h2 bid=\"740\" id=\"Former_apparatus_and_events\">\n        Former apparatus and events\n       </h2>\n      </summary>\n      <details bid=\"741\" data-level=\"3\" open=\"\">\n       <summary bid=\"742\" class=\"section-heading\">\n        &lt;::marker&gt;\n        <h3 bid=\"743\" id=\"Rope_climbing\">\n         Rope climbing\n        </h3>\n       </summary>\n       <div bid=\"744\" class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\" role=\"note\">\n        Main article:\n        <a bid=\"745\" href=\"Rope_climbing\" title=\"Rope climbing\">\n         Rope climbing\n        </a>\n       </div>\n       Generally, competitors climbed either a 6m (6.1m = 20\n       ft in the US) or an 8m (7.6m = 25\n       ft in the US), 38\n       mm diameter (1.5-inch) natural fiber rope for speed, starting from a seated position on the floor and using only the hands and arms.

I\u2019m already on the Gymnastics article and can see the Tumbling section, including the table titled \u201cCommon Types of Skills in Tumbling,\u201d which lists the skills: Round-off, End Skill, Flick, Whip, Double Somersault, Triple Somersault, Twisting Somersault, Combination Somersault, Transition Skill. I\u2019ve saved these in a note for use when composing the Reddit post.\n\nNext, I need to post to Reddit. The task tips indicate that to visit other websites, I should use the homepage at http://10.177.124.109:4399, which also has passwords at /password.html. The logical next step is to navigate to that homepage to locate Reddit and any necessary login credentials before composing the post with the required Title and Body format.\n</think>\n<action>\n```goto('http://10.177.124.109:4399')```</action>",
