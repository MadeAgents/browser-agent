From the history, we have the repository open in Tab 0 at the README.md file page, and we opened a new tab to retrieve the Wikipedia content. The currently active tab is about:blank. The next step is to navigate to the offline Wikipedia landing page provided in the Task Tips to search for and obtain the first paragraph of the SARS-CoV-2 article. Once we have the text, we\u2019ll switch back to the GitLab tab and use the Replace or Edit function to update the README content, then commit.
