I already have Postmill open on Tab 0, and an empty Tab 1 is active. To obtain the explanation, I should navigate to the offline Wikipedia instance provided in the task tips. The most direct next step is to go to the Wikipedia landing page at the Kiwix URL so I can search for \"Robotics\" and locate the \"Piezo motors\" section. Since only one action is allowed, I will navigate to the Kiwix Wikipedia landing page now.\n</think>\n<action>\n```goto('http://10.177.37.113:8888/wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2022-05/A/User:The_other_Kiwix_guy/Landing')```</action>",
