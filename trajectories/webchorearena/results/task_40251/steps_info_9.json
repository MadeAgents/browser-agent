From prior context, the repository\u2019s LICENSE is currently MIT, and we need to replace it with Apache License 2.0 (as used by openapi-generator). The currently active tab is about:blank and shows a blank page, while Tab 0 is the Web IDE opened directly to the LICENSE file of the target repo. To proceed with editing and committing the correct license text, I should switch focus back to Tab 0 where the IDE is available. The next best action is to bring Tab 0 to the front.\n</think>\n<action>\n```tab_focus(0)```\n</action>",
