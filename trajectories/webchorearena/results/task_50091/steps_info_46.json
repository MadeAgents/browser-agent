The most efficient next step is to navigate directly to the offline Wikipedia landing page provided in the Task Tips: http://10.177.37.113:8888/wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2022-05/A/User:The_other_Kiwix_guy/Landing. From there, we will use the search to find the relevant list (e.g., \u201cList of Japanese Nobel laureates\u201d or \u201cList of Nobel laureates by country#Japan\u201d), extract names by category, and later return to the GitLab tab to edit README.md with sorted, Markdown-formatted sections.
