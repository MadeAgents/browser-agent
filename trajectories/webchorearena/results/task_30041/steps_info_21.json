Dude, they were residents of the Run...people who lived there.\n       </p>\n       <p bid=\"191\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n        The people living there wanted  the money to go to their problems instead.  Their houses are built on a drainage channel and will never stop flooding.  It didn\u2019t seem to me like they made any compelling arguments about how the MOC would negatively affect them besides spend the money on bailing out their basements instead. There are two sides to every project and also a lot of shill involved so everyone has to think for themselves about who is telling the truth and who isn\u2019t.  There was a pile on affect of every activist in the city jumping in to hate on upmc and cmu and they took advantage of the local residents to get their chance in the limelight.  The project was probably a waste of money and I don\u2019t think cmu or anyone with influence really cared about it anyway.  But I think it was more about using the schools as a punching bag than it was about actually helping the run.  Now that the project is canceled,  the activists have moved on to other nonprofit bashing efforts while the run is still in the same shit condition and always will be because saline street should be a stream instead of a street\n       </p>\n      </div>\n     </div>\n     <nav bid=\"192\" class=\"comment__nav hideable__hide\">\n      <ul bid=\"193\" class=\"fg-muted flex flex--guttered

They are mad that PWSA  won\u2019t spend more money on them.  $36 million is $500,000 per house in the run.   They think PWSA has some sort of obligation to make up for the fact that their houses are in the worst possible location for flooding.  Blocking the MOC was simply because they wanted every last cent to go toward them.\n               </p>\n               <p bid=\"532\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n                As I said before, the MOC project was mediocre.  My point is the conspiracy around cmu being a power broker trying to screw over people is exaggerated. Cmu has put a lot of effort into storm water management on campus with green roofs rain gardens and underground cisterns.   If you are looking for an evil non profit go look at upmc.\n               </p>\n               <p bid=\"533\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n                Peduto was never shy about proposing audacious projects and some were good and some were bad but at least he had is heart in it and I got no impression he was just doing it for special interest groups.  But activists couldn\u2019t stand that he wasn\u2019t a flame thrower directed at every for profit and non profit business in the city.\n               </p>\n               <p bid=\"534\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n                Meanwhile, during snowmageddon,  ravenstahl was hiding out in seven springs and spent days refusing to tell the public where he was bc he was staying in the condo of one of the largest real estate developers in the county.  somebody in  hazlewood died because an ambulance couldn\u2019t get through the unplowed streets.  I met ravenstahl once while he was at a penguins game in the box suite of the law firm representing burns and scalo.  Ravenstahl never saw a corporate handout he couldn\u2019t refuse like the $9000 sponsorship from upmc for a golf tournament.\n               </p>\n               <p bid=\"535\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n                I don\u2019t know if gainey will be a better mayor but it\u2019s not like peduto was unpopular.  He lost to gainey 26,000 to 22,000 in a city of 300,000 people.  Which is impressive that peduto managed to last as long as he did.  He wasn\u2019t afraid to take risks like when he pushed for removing parking from schenly plaza and added bike lanes and round abouts.  These sort of changes drive reactionary people crazy even though they were the right way to go. He lasted 20 years in city politics so in my mind he deserves a pat on the back.  Gainey is quickly finding out how hard and intense the criticism is when you are mayor versus just a state legislator.\n               </p>\n               <p bid=\"536\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n
