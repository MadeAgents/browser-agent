To transfer this content to the new repository\u2019s README in the Web IDE (Tab 0), I need to copy the raw text first. Since the page shows plain selectable text and the RootWebArea is focused, the most efficient next step is to select all content using a global keyboard shortcut. After that, I will copy it, switch back to the IDE tab, paste into the README.md editor, and commit the changes. Given only one action is allowed per step, I will start by selecting all text with ControlOrMeta+a.\n</think>\n<action>\n```keyboard_press('ControlOrMeta+a')```\n</action>",
