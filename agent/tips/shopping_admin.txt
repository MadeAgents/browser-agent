Here are tips for using this website:
1. When you add a new product in the CATALOG > Products tab, you can click the downwardarrow beside the "Add Product" button to select options like "Simple Product", "Configurable Product", etc.
2. If you need to add new attribute values (e.g. size, color, etc) to a product, you can find the product at CATALOG > Products, search for the product, edit product with "Configurable Product" type, and use "Edit Configurations" to add the product with new attribute values. If the value that you want does not exist, you may need to add new values to the attribute.
3. If you need to add new values to product attributes (e.g. size, color, etc), you can visit STORES > Attributes > Product, find the attribute and click, and add value after clicking "Add Swatch" button.
4. You can generate various reports by using menus in the REPORTS tab. Select REPORTS > "report type", select options, and click "Show Report" to view report.
5. In this website, there is a UI that looks like a dropdown, but is just a 1-of-n selection menu. For example in REPORTS > Orders, if you select "Specified" Order Status, you will choose one from many options (e.g. Canceled, Closed, ...), but it's not dropdown, so your click will just highlight your selection (1-of-n select UI will not disappear).
6. Configurable products have some options that you can mark as "on" of "off". For example, the options may include "new", "sale", "eco collection", etc.
7. You can find all reviews and their counts in the store in MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews. If you see all reviews grouped by product, go REPORTS > By Products and search by Product name.
8. This website has been operating since 2022. So if you have to find a report for the entire history, you can select the date from Jan 1, 2022, to Today.
9. Do not export or download files, or try to open files. It will not work.
10. To retrieve a customer's historical order statistics: Navigate to the Reports menu. Select the Order Count page. Set the date range as "From 01/01/2022" and "To 01/01/2023". Under Show By, choose "Year".
11. When querying recent orders, you must sort them in descending order by Purchase Date, regardless of any default sorting. This sorting operation must be performed at least once. Additionally, do not set a per-page limit; instead, directly retrieve the most recent k orders.
12. For any calculation-related task—such as summing amounts, computing averages, applying discounts, or evaluating arithmetic expressions—you must use the calculate(expression) function. Do not perform mental math or inline reasoning to compute numerical results. Always construct a valid mathematical expression as a string and pass it to calculate() to ensure accuracy and reliability.
13. When the task asks to return customers, return the FULL Customer name (only if you know the full name).
14. When asked about how much is spent on a certain category or some description is given. Assume it is specifically about that categroy ONLY. An order might consist of several different categories of products. ONLY select ones that are specifically asked about.
15. **THIS IS IMPORTANT**: When asked about how is spent on a category include the shipping & handling as part of the cost calculation. The ORDER TOTAL will include both the shipping and handling cost as well.
    Ex: If there are two items in an order and the shipping & handling is $10.00 then each item would be charged $5. (Split the shipping and handling evenly amongst the number of orders.)
16. When asked to "show me products under a price" the benchmark evaluates based on the url. so just ensure the price is under the price asked for in the url.
17. When asked about product type don't return the acutal product name but rather the type of product it is. Ex: If the most common products are "harry potter" and "twilight" the product type is "books".
18. **When asked about product names**, please strictly preserve all symbols and formatting—including ™, ®, ©, and other trademark indicators—and ensure the names in your response exactly match the original data.
