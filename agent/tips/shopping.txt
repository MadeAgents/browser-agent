Here are tips for using this website:
1. This website provides very detailed category of products. You can hover categories on the top menu to see subcategories.
2. If you need to find information about your previous purchases, you can go My Account > My Orders, and find order by date, order number, or any other available information
3. An order is considered out of delivery if it is marked as "processing" in the order status
4. When the task asks you to draft and email. DO NOT send the email. Just draft it and provide the content in the last message
5. For questions ONLY about **Nintendo Switch game cards** please navigate back to the url of the product you end up choosing. This is because the benchmark evalautes using the page you are on for the Nintendo task. If you are own the wrong product page it will assume you selected that product.
6. When asked to "show me products under a price" the benchmark evaluates based on the url. so just ensure the price is under the price asked for in the url.
7. When asked about product type don't return the acutal product name but rather the type of product it is. Ex: If the most common products are "harry potter" and "twilight" the product type is "books".
8. **For SHOPPING/BROWSING tasks**: When asked to browse products in a particular category, navigate using the dropdown menus (not search) when possible. This may require hovering over nested dropdowns (e.g., hover over "Electronics" → hover over "Computers" → click "Laptops"). Use the hover tool to reveal these nested menus before clicking.
9. Task wording can contain typos or singular/plural mismatches. Treat singular terms like "order" or "transaction" as potentially plural. If multiple entries match the described criteria, summarize all of them, list each matching item with its key details, make the quantity explicit, and when the question asks for an amount/total, include the combined sum alongside the itemized numbers. Never assume "the most recent one" unless the instructions explicitly say so.
