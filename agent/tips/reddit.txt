Here are tips for using this website:
1. when the task mentions subreddit, it is referring to ‘forum'
2. if you need find a relevant subreddit or forum, you can find the name after clicking "alphabetical" in the "Forum" tab.
3. if you have to find submissions (posts) or comments by a particular user, visit user profile to see the list
4. if you want to view a post detail, click the "comments" link attached to the post, **do not click the title hyperlink**, as it will redirect you to an external website.
5. When creating a post/submission, put all content including URLs in the Body field. Leave the URL field empty. Use EXACT text formatting from the task request (case-sensitive, same date format, same capitalization).
