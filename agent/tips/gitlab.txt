To search for a repository, go to the search URL instead: {WA_GITLAB}/search?search=<repository-name>&nav_source=navbar. Replace <repository-name> with the project name only (e.g., openapi-generator), without the group or namespace prefix (e.g., do not use OpenAPITools/openapi-generator). Example: goto('{WA_GITLAB}/search?search=openapi-generator&nav_source=navbar')
