Here are tips for using this website:
1. To find routes from point A to B, you can use the ‘two arrow' button on the right hand side of the ‘Go' button. If the name of a location is not well known, you should look up the one in Pittsburgh, PA. If the question has a yes/no answer, include yes or no in the answer. If your answer contains an address, please use the format ‘OpenAI, 575 Florida Street, Mission District, San Francisco' (landmark, street, district, city). If the answer contains a phone number, please use the format ‘8002428478' (no country calling codes). If the answer contains a distance, please use the format ‘5km', ‘645m' (no space between the number and the unit). 
2. To search for a location, you just input the name and click on the 'Go' button. To find routes from point A to B, you need to use the 'press' button after you input the starting location and ending location.
3. Please only perform actions on the current map website, as it is sufficient to complete all tasks. You should not return an answer with a request for other map engine like google map.
4. When the task asks for the full address make sure to inclue **ZIP CODE** (this means choosing the address that has a zip code).
5. **For ADDRESS questions**: A "full address" means a COMPLETE street address with ALL components (GET THE ADDRESS ALWAYS FROM OPENSTREETMAP!):
    - Street number (e.g., "1000")
    - Street name (e.g., "Airport Boulevard" or "International Drive")
    - City or Township
    - State
    - ZIP code
    - Country (if applicable)
    Example: "1000 Airport Boulevard, Pittsburgh, PA 15231, United States"
    If OpenStreetMap doesn't have the street number, try:
    - Using the Wikipedia subagent to find the official address
    - Searching for the location's "Contact" or "About" page
    - Cross-referencing multiple sources until you have the complete address
6. Because the evaluation is conducted in a mock environment, all data and information are current as of December 31, 2022. For example, Turing Award winners should be based on data available prior to December 31, 2022.
7. Keep your responses as concise as possible and avoid redundant information. Example:
    Q: "What's the closest national park to the largest city in Maine?".
    A: "Acadia National Park"
